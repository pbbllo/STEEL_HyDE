"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible evidence or legislation that suggests health care reform will mandate free sex change surgeries. While some health care reform discussions may include provisions for gender-affirming care, these are typically focused on providing necessary medical treatments and not on mandating specific procedures. The claim is misleading and not supported by current legislation or policy discussions.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing two unrelated entities: the number of starting quarterbacks for the Chicago Bears in the last 10 years and the number of tenured faculty fired at the University of Wisconsin (UW) in the last two decades. These two numbers cannot be directly compared as they are from different contexts and do not have a logical relationship. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: During Mitt Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, the state's budget did indeed decrease in size. However, it's important to note that this was primarily due to a decrease in spending on social services and education, rather than a broad-based reduction in government size. Additionally, the state's budget was also influenced by federal stimulus funds during the recession. Therefore, while there was a reduction in government spending, it is not accurate to say that the rate of growth of the government was slowed or that it was cut overall.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was known for his strong support of free trade and opposed protectionist measures. He was a co-sponsor of the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2015, which gave the president the power to negotiate trade agreements. He also supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. There is no evidence to suggest that he opposed a requirement for the government to buy American-made motorcycles or that he called all buy-American provisions ""disgraceful.""

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that both women and men are making less when adjusted for inflation compared to when John Kitzhaber was first elected governor. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical data on wages and inflation rates. However, without specific data points or a clear reference to the time period in question, it is challenging to verify the claim. Typically, wage adjustments for inflation are calculated using indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). If the claim is based on a specific study or data set, it would need to be referenced to confirm its accuracy.

Instead, they aimed to reduce emissions by encouraging the use of cleaner energy sources and improving efficiency. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has the authority to regulate toilet seats is false. The U.S. federal government does not have the authority to regulate toilet seats. This is a matter that falls under the purview of state and local governments, not the federal government. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of regulations related to public health and safety, which are more broadly applicable to public restrooms and not specifically to toilet seats.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Austin has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded is not accurate. While Austin has experienced significant growth over the years, the rate of doubling every 25 years is an exaggeration. Austin's population growth has been steady but not exponential. For instance, in the 1970s, Austin's population was around 300,000, and by the 2000s, it had grown to around 700,000, which is a significant increase but not a doubling every 25 years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the nuclear test conducted in our nation this time is the Earth's 2,054th nuclear test is false.

Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of the total nuclear tests is also false. The United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China have conducted a significant portion of nuclear tests, but the exact percentage is not 99.99%.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The term ""terrorist attack"" is commonly used by government officials, including the Director of Homeland Security, to describe incidents where individuals or groups use violence or threats of violence to achieve political, religious, or ideological goals.

The Director of Homeland Security, like other government officials, would use the term ""terrorist attack"" to describe such events.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission's ideas is false. While it is true that the commission's recommendations were not fully implemented, Obama did take some actions based on the commission's findings. For instance, he signed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which was partially based on the commission's recommendations. Therefore, the claim that he took ""exactly none"" of the ideas is an oversimplification and is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the New York State Governor Kathy Hochul in a press release. According to the press release, New York State added 800,000 private sector jobs in 2021, which is a significant increase. The unemployment rate in New York State has been decreasing, and as of the latest data, it is indeed lower than it was before the pandemic. However, the claim that New York State has more private sector jobs than it has ever had in its history is not explicitly stated in the press release. The press release only mentions that the state added 800,000 jobs in 2021, which is a record for the state, but it does not compare this to all-time historical data.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama, who served as the 44th President of the United States, did not run for re-election in 2016. Therefore, he did not have a campaign to announce his cabinet choices. The claim seems to be a mix-up with the 2008 presidential election, where he was elected as the President.

"Explanation: Mayor Jorge Elorza, not Mayor Cicilline, was the mayor of Providence during the period when the city was designated as a sanctuary city. Mayor Elorza signed an executive order in 2014 that made Providence a sanctuary city, which means the city limits its cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Therefore, the claim that Mayor Cicilline was responsible for Providence being a sanctuary city is false.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misinformation.

"Explanation: The claim that Virginia has been net zero on job creation since Bob McDonnell became governor in 2010 is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Virginia has seen a net increase in employment since 2010.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The savings rate in the United States during the recession was not 6.2 percent. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the personal savings rate in the U.S. was around 13.6 percent in the first quarter of 2020, which was a significant increase from the pre-pandemic levels. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is asking about a general practice or expectation regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominees during confirmation hearings.

"Explanation: Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor and U.S. Representative, has been known to support various healthcare policies, but there is no specific evidence or statement from him that directly supports cuts to the Medicare Advantage program.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Scott Brown, a former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, did not co-sponsor any legislation that would allow employers to deny women coverage for birth control.

"Explanation: While Egypt has made some progress in political and democratic reforms in the past 20 years, such as the 2011 revolution and the subsequent constitutional amendments, the overall political environment remains highly authoritarian. The government has been criticized for suppressing political opposition, restricting freedom of speech, and limiting civil liberties. Therefore, the claim that Egypt has made ""great strides"" in political and democratic reform is an overstatement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the attention paid to Chris Christie this week with the coverage of the Benghazi incident. As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have specific data on the exact amount of attention paid to Chris Christie this week or the coverage of the Benghazi incident. However, the claim suggests a comparison in significance, which is subjective and depends on the context and the source of the information. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"

"Explanation: The claim that Phoenix, Arizona, is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world is not accurate. While Phoenix does have a high rate of kidnappings compared to other cities in the United States, it is not the second highest in the world.

"Explanation: The claim that US population growth is at its lowest since the Great Depression is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population growth rate in the United States has been declining in recent years, but it is not at its lowest since the Great Depression. The Great Depression period (1929-1939) saw a significant decline in population growth due to the economic crisis and the Dust Bowl, but the current population growth rate is still higher than that period.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of deaths from gunfire in the United States since 1968 to the total number of deaths in all of the country's wars throughout its history. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been approximately 1.5 million gun-related deaths in the U.S. since 1968. In contrast, the total number of deaths in all U.S. wars is significantly lower. For example, the Vietnam War alone resulted in approximately 58,000 deaths. Therefore, the claim that more Americans have died from gunfire since 1968 than in all of the country's wars is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' website, FreshFromFlorida.com, is primarily focused on providing information about Florida's agriculture, food, and consumer services.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that NATO is opening up a major terror division is false. NATO has not announced any such division, and there is no credible source supporting this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Sen. Barack Obama, who later became President Obama, has indeed been consistently rated as pro-choice by organizations such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. However, the claim that he has always had a ""100 percent pro-choice rating"" is a simplification. While he has consistently supported abortion rights, his stance has evolved over time, and he has not always been in favor of all aspects of abortion rights. For example, he has supported restrictions on late-term abortions. Therefore, the claim that he has always had a ""100 percent pro-choice rating"" is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal debt is growing by more than $4 billion a day is not accurate. The U.S. federal debt is indeed increasing, but the daily increase is not consistently more than $4 billion.

For instance, in 2021, the U.S. federal debt increased by an average of about $3.5 billion per day, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999 is based on the assumption that the current job growth rate is higher than the rate in 1999.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim states that about half of the presidents have been governors and half of them have been senators. This claim is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. Supreme Court found that Social Security is not guaranteed is false. The Social Security Act of 1935 established a system of old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits, which are guaranteed to eligible individuals.

"Explanation: The claim that ""half our general revenue goes to education"" is not accurate. The percentage of general revenue allocated to education varies by country and can be influenced by various factors such as the specific government's budget priorities, economic conditions, and the overall tax revenue. For example, in the United States, education spending is a significant portion of the federal budget, but it is not exactly half. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in 2020, the federal government spent about 10% of its budget on education, while state and local governments spent a larger portion. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Judges' benefits, including salary, retirement plans, and other perks, are typically determined by state laws and regulations.

Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that small businesses create 70 percent of the jobs in America is often cited but is not entirely accurate.

"Explanation: The Cash for Clunkers program, which was a U.S. government program that ran from July 2009 to August 2009, did offer incentives for trading in older vehicles for new, more fuel-efficient ones. However, the claim that you can simply tow an old car to your house and receive $4,500 is inaccurate. The program required that the old vehicle be traded in for a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle, and the $4,500 was a voucher that could be used towards the purchase of the new vehicle, not a direct payment for the old vehicle.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real"" is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. While it is true that some Republicans have been skeptical about the extent and urgency of climate change, there are also many Republicans who acknowledge that climate change is real and support action to address it. For example, former Republican Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger has been a vocal advocate for climate action. Therefore, the claim is false.

The claim of 28,000 deaths is an exaggeration and not supported by reliable data.

"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was implemented to increase access to affordable health insurance. While it is true that some people may have lost their insurance due to changes in the law, the overall goal of the ACA was to expand coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsured rate in the U.S. dropped from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2019, indicating that millions more people gained access to insurance. Therefore, the claim that the law denies millions access to affordable insurance is false.

"Explanation: The claim that close to 30% of the federal prison population consists of illegal immigrants is not accurate. According to the most recent data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 4.7% of the federal prison population is composed of immigrants who are not U.S. citizens. This percentage includes both those who are in the country illegally and those who are lawful permanent residents or have other immigration statuses.

In the 1985 election, Tom Kean defeated Jim Florio with a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%, which was indeed a significant margin. However, the claim that this was the largest margin in Jersey history is incorrect. In 1993, Jim Florio defeated Christine Todd Whitman with a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%, which is the same margin as Tom Kean's victory in 1985. Therefore, neither of these elections had the largest margin in Jersey history.

"Explanation: The claim that there is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used is not entirely accurate. While some studies have suggested that red light cameras may not significantly reduce accidents, other studies have shown that they can lead to a decrease in accidents and violations. The effectiveness of red light cameras can vary depending on the specific intersection and the implementation of the system. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 29,000 Oregonians, which is approximately 5% of all homeowners, are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage. This claim is based on a specific statistic from a reliable source, such as a government report or a reputable news outlet. Without additional context or verification, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Hate Crimes bill, also known as the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, does not target religious leaders for their sermons about sexual practices. The bill is designed to enhance penalties for hate crimes, which are crimes motivated by bias against a person's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. It does not criminalize religious teachings or moral traditions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that state school funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation. To verify this claim, we would need to look at specific data on state school funding per pupil from 2009 and the present year, adjusted for inflation. Without access to this data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on reliable sources and accurate data, it would be true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: In 2013, the number of people receiving welfare benefits in the United States was indeed higher than the number of people working. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2013, there were approximately 47.7 million people receiving some form of government assistance, while the number of people employed was around 155.5 million. Therefore, the claim that there were more people on welfare than working in 2013 is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that State Rep. Kristi Thibaut was an ACORN lobbyist is false. ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) was a community organizing group that was active in the United States from 1970 to 2010. There is no evidence to suggest that Kristi Thibaut was a lobbyist for ACORN. The claim appears to be a misinformation or a false accusation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that any legislative action taken now could be nullified by a decision of the Supreme Court expected this June. This is a speculative statement and does not provide specific details about the legislative actions or the Supreme Court's expected decision. The Supreme Court's decisions can indeed impact legislation, but the claim is too vague to be considered true or false without more context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a political statement and does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that New York City is not getting its fair share of money. It is a general statement that could be interpreted differently depending on the context and the specific policies being discussed.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the current administration and Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control is not accurate. In fact, the Trump administration, which was in power from 2017 to 2021, requested and received significant funding for border security, including the construction of the border wall. The Biden administration has also requested and received funding for border security, although the specifics of how that funding is allocated and used have been a subject of debate and criticism. Therefore, the claim that funding has been systematically cut is misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Mitt Romney released his tax returns during his 2012 presidential campaign. He released two years of tax returns in 2012, and in 2016, he released his tax returns for the previous two years. Therefore, the claim that he is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns is false.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that Obama's tax plan cuts taxes ""for 95 percent of all working families"" is a simplification and an exaggeration. While the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Obama, did include tax cuts for many Americans, it is not accurate to say that 95 percent of all working families benefited from these cuts. The tax cuts were targeted at lower- and middle-income individuals and families, but the percentage of beneficiaries was not as high as 95 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 59 percent of Americans believe Barack Obama is still a Muslim is false. According to various polls and surveys, the majority of Americans do not believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim. For instance, a 2016 poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found that only 11% of Americans believe that Obama is a Muslim. Therefore, the claim that 59 percent of Americans hold this belief is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Carol Shea-Porter wants to increase taxes on small businesses and job creators is a political statement that can be interpreted differently based on the context and specific policies she has proposed. Without specific details or a clear source, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim. However, if the claim is based on general political rhetoric or specific policy proposals, it would need to be evaluated within that context.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific context or source.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. A bill delaying the start of classes until Labor Day would not necessarily shave 5 full weeks off the school year. The actual number of weeks shaved would depend on the specific dates of Labor Day and the current start date of the school year. Additionally, the claim assumes that the school year would end on the same date as it would have without the delay, which is not necessarily the case.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about whether the United States should intervene in Libya is a political and strategic question that does not have a definitive true or false answer. It depends on the perspective and the criteria used to evaluate the intervention. For instance, some might argue that intervention is necessary to prevent humanitarian crises or to support democratic movements, while others might argue that it is not in the U.S.'s best interest to intervene due to potential risks, costs, and the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false in an absolute sense.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Gallup does not conduct polls in Egypt, and there is no evidence to support the claim that 70 percent of Egyptians do not want U.S. money. Gallup is an American polling organization that primarily conducts surveys in the United States and other countries, but not Egypt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statistic from the FBI's crime statistics, which is a reliable source. However, without specific data or context, it's difficult to verify the exact percentage reduction in violent crime during a particular administration. The claim could be true if the data supports it, but it requires further verification.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: Scott Maddox has indeed run for several political offices in Florida, including for the Florida Senate and the Florida House of Representatives. However, the claim that he has run ""losing campaigns for 3 of Florida's 4 available cabinet positions"" is misleading. Cabinet positions in Florida are not elected positions but are appointed by the Governor. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Scott Maddox has run for these positions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Americans spend 6.1 billion hours a year on tax preparation is false. According to the IRS, Americans spend an average of 13.5 hours per year on tax preparation. This figure is significantly lower than the claimed 6.1 billion hours.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States is now energy independent for the first time ever is not accurate. While the U.S. has made significant strides in reducing its dependence on foreign energy sources, it is not entirely energy independent. The U.S. still imports and exports energy, and its energy independence is more about reducing dependence on specific sources rather than being completely self-sufficient. The term ""energy independence"" is often used to describe a situation where a country produces enough energy to meet its own needs without relying on imports from other countries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour last year is false. This figure is not accurate and does not reflect the company's actual earnings. Exxon's annual earnings are significantly lower than the claimed hourly figure. For instance, in 2021, Exxon's net income was approximately $19.4 billion, which translates to about $53 million per day or $2.2 million per hour, not $4.7 million per hour.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Republican Sen. John McCain won more votes in Cuyahoga County in the 2008 general election than he did in seven states. This claim is false because it is not possible for McCain to have won more votes in a single county than in seven states. The total number of votes in a county is typically much smaller than the total number of votes in seven states combined.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of African American men currently in the U.S. criminal justice system (prison, jail, probation, or parole) to the number of enslaved African Americans in 1850. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, as of 2019, there were approximately 2.2 million African American men in the U.S. criminal justice system. In 1850, the U.S. Census reported approximately 3.9 million enslaved African Americans. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that limiting labor negotiations to only wages is how it is for the most part in the private sector is not entirely accurate. While wages are certainly a significant part of labor negotiations, private sector negotiations often also include other aspects such as benefits, working conditions, job security, and other perks. These negotiations can be quite comprehensive and are not limited solely to wages.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Del Valle, a neighborhood in Austin, Texas, has several grocery stores within its vicinity. The closest grocery stores to Del Valle are located in the area itself, such as H-E-B and Walmart, which are both within a short driving distance. Therefore, residents of Del Valle do not need to drive to Bastrop to access the closest grocery store.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mark Warner voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt is false. Mark Warner has been a consistent advocate for fiscal responsibility and has voted against many of the tax increases and debt increases proposed by the Democratic Party. He has also been critical of excessive government spending and has voted against many of the spending bills proposed by the Democratic Party. Therefore, the claim that he voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt is inaccurate and misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a United Nations arms treaty would almost certainly force the U.S. to create an international gun registry and set the stage for full-scale gun confiscation is false. The United Nations has no authority to force the U.S. to create an international gun registry or confiscate guns. The U.S. is not a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), and the treaty does not require any country to create a gun registry or confiscate guns. The ATT is a voluntary agreement that aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, and it does not impose any obligations on non-signatory countries like the U.S.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there was ""virtually no international pressure on Iran"" when a certain administration took office is a subjective statement and can be difficult to verify without specific context.

This pressure has been exerted through various means, including economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and international resolutions.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that abortion doctors are flying into a state, performing abortions, and flying out is a common misconception.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Maurice Ferre says Kendrick Meek has voted 98.6 percent of the time with the Democrat party is not verifiable with the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is dead last in income growth among midwestern states during Gov. Scott Walker's term is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Wisconsin's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was higher than several other midwestern states during Walker's tenure as governor. For example, in 2015, Wisconsin's GDP growth rate was 2.5%, which was higher than states like Illinois (1.8%) and Michigan (1.6%). Therefore, the claim that Wisconsin is dead last in income growth is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about a three-cents-per-ounce soda tax in Philadelphia resulting in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry is based on a study conducted by the Center for Local Government Finance and Policy. The study estimated that a soda tax could lead to job losses in the beverage industry, including those held by Teamsters. However, the specific number of 2,000 jobs is not universally accepted and is subject to debate. The impact of a soda tax on jobs can vary depending on factors such as the size of the tax, the economic conditions in the region, and the response of the beverage industry.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or not definitively true based on the available information.)"
"Explanation: The claim ""On repeal of Wisconsin's smoking ban"" is incomplete and lacks specific details about the repeal of the smoking ban.

"Explanation: The claim is true. John Hagee, a prominent American evangelist, has made controversial statements about Hurricane Katrina and the Catholic Church. In 2005, he stated that Hurricane Katrina was a punishment from God for the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that 51 percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax is based on a misinterpretation of data. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reports that about 44% of tax filers do not owe any federal income tax because they have no taxable income or their tax credits and deductions exceed their tax liability. However, this does not mean that 51% of filers paid zero tax; it means that 51% of tax filers had no taxable income or their tax credits and deductions covered their tax liability.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin has been losing jobs at rates not seen in decades since Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took office is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been relatively stable and has not shown a significant increase since Walker took office in 2011. In fact, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been lower than the national average for much of Walker's tenure. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The last Republican senator from New Jersey was Tom Kean, who served from 1982 to 1989. Since then, no Republican has been elected to the Senate from New Jersey.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that unions take away hard-earned money from teachers, firefighters, and police officers to play politics is a generalization and often a misrepresentation of the role of unions. Unions primarily exist to negotiate better wages, benefits, and working conditions for their members. The dues collected from members are used to fund these negotiations, legal battles, and other services provided to the members. The idea that these funds are used solely for political purposes is a common misconception. While unions may contribute to political campaigns, this is typically done through separate political action committees (PACs) and is not a primary use of member dues.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: President George W. Bush did indeed conduct interviews with the New York Times during his presidency. For instance, he granted an interview to the New York Times in 2004, which was published on October 10, 2004. Therefore, the claim that he never did one interview with the New York Times during his entire presidency is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign and therefore has no donors is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 2,000 high schools, which is approximately 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States, produce about half of the nation's dropouts. This claim is false because it is not possible for a specific number of schools to produce half of the nation's dropouts. The number of dropouts is distributed across a much larger number of schools, and the claim does not provide any evidence or data to support this specific percentage.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Atlanta Housing Authority, which found that approximately 40% of Atlanta households spend more than 30% of their income on rent. This study was published in 2019 and is a reliable source of information. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the Providence teacher contract is one of the longest in the country is not verifiable with the information provided.

Without specific data or a comparison with other contracts, it is impossible to determine if the Providence teacher contract is indeed one of the longest in the country.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the debt accumulated under the current president to the debt accumulated under all previous presidents combined. This is a complex comparison that requires specific data and context. Without specific data points or a clear definition of ""all those other presidents,"" it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. However, if we consider the total debt accumulated under the current president and compare it to the total debt accumulated under all previous presidents, the claim could be true or false depending on the specific data.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim that annual precipitation has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century is not accurate. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average annual precipitation in Rhode Island has increased by about 4 inches over the last century. This increase is consistent with broader trends of increased precipitation in the northeastern United States, but it does not meet the threshold of over 12 inches as stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the state budget proposal has been submitted on time and that it is the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades.

Without this specific information, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information.)"
"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV (Bureau of Motor Vehicles) is false. Ohio has a process in place to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV. The BMV is required to notify the county board of elections of any address changes, and the county board of elections is responsible for updating the voter registration records. This process ensures that voter registrations are kept up-to-date with the most current address information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the most commonly spoken languages in Texas, after English, are Spanish and Vietnamese.

"Explanation: The claim is subjective and depends on personal opinion. The term ""most generous"" and ""good time bill"" are not quantifiable or universally defined. Therefore, it is impossible to objectively verify the claim as true or false without additional context or specific details about the bill in question.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the most likely triggering cause of microcephaly is the DTaP shot is false. The most widely accepted cause of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015-2016 was the Zika virus, which was transmitted by mosquitoes. The Zika virus infection during pregnancy has been linked to microcephaly in newborns. The DTaP vaccine is a different vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, and it is not associated with microcephaly. The Brazilian government's mandate for the DTaP vaccine was unrelated to the Zika virus outbreak.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening)"" is a simplification and an exaggeration of the current job market situation. While it is true that the unemployment rate has been fluctuating and there are periods where the number of job seekers exceeds the number of job openings, the claim that there are three people looking for every job is not accurate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that as of the latest data, the ratio of job seekers to job openings is not as high as three to one. Therefore, the claim is an overstatement and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the individual reduced salaries and health benefits by about $10 million while serving as Dane County executive in Wisconsin.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton's ""baby bond"" proposal, as outlined in her 2019 book ""What Happened,"" is a plan to provide a $5,000 trust fund for every child born in the United States. The claim incorrectly states that this would total $20 billion per year and then multiplies it by four years to reach $80 billion. The correct calculation would be $5,000 per child per year, which would indeed total $20 billion per year for 4 million births. However, the claim incorrectly multiplies this annual total by four years, which is not part of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island would be the first state in the nation to implement a hybrid retirement plan is not accurate. Hybrid retirement plans, which combine elements of defined benefit and defined contribution plans, have been implemented in various states and organizations across the United States. For example, the state of California has implemented a hybrid retirement plan for its employees. Therefore, the claim that Rhode Island would be the first state to do this is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the State Department reduced security in Libya before the Benghazi attacks is a matter of ongoing debate and has been the subject of multiple investigations and reports. The Accountability Review Board (ARB) report on the Benghazi attacks found that the State Department had requested additional security for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, but the requests were not always granted in a timely manner. However, the report also noted that the security situation in Libya was complex and that the U.S. government was working to improve security measures. The claim that security was actually reduced is not supported by the ARB report or other credible sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Failure to raise the debt limit does not directly force a U.S. default on debt payments. However, it can lead to a default if the government is unable to pay its bills, including interest on its debt. This is because the debt limit is the legal limit on how much debt the U.S. government can accumulate. If the debt limit is not raised, the government may not have enough money to pay its bills, including interest on its debt, which could lead to a default.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Democrats in the Legislature in 2009 voted for various pork projects including a $5 million scoreboard for the Milwaukee Bucks is false. The Milwaukee Bucks' new arena, which includes a $5 million scoreboard, was approved in 2019, not in 2009. The arena project was part of a broader agreement that included public funding, but the specific details of the scoreboard's funding were not part of the 2009 legislative session.

"Explanation: The claim states that the number of people in Atlanta dying from HIV and AIDS declined by 59 percent between 2004 and 2012. This claim can be verified by checking reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or local health department reports. According to the CDC, the number of HIV/AIDS deaths in Atlanta has indeed decreased significantly over this period, with a notable decline in the number of new infections and AIDS-related deaths.

The number of jobs lost by women was around 2.3 million, which is about 26% of the total jobs lost. Therefore, the claim that 92% of the jobs lost belonged to women is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican Party has not historically advocated for the elimination of the Department of Education. In fact, the Department of Education was established under the administration of Republican President Richard Nixon in 1979. The claim that the Department of Education was doubled in size under Republican leadership is also incorrect. The size of the Department of Education has fluctuated over time, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it was doubled under any specific administration.

"Explanation: The claim is about a specific situation involving inmates and their living conditions. However, without specific sources or context, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim.

"Explanation: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has indeed called for an immediate federal monitor for the Newark Police Department. This was done in response to concerns about the department's use of force and racial profiling. The ACLU's call for a federal monitor was made in a letter to the Department of Justice in 2018, and the request was granted. Therefore, the claim that the ACLU did not call for an investigation but instead called for an immediate federal monitor is true.

"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come to the United States is false. During his presidency, Obama implemented several policies to strengthen border security and immigration vetting processes. For instance, he expanded the use of biometric technology, increased the number of border patrol agents, and implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provided temporary relief from deportation for certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Additionally, he supported comprehensive immigration reform that included measures to improve border security and streamline the immigration process.

"Explanation: The claim that the No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work is a simplification of a complex issue. While job creation and economic recovery are indeed significant concerns for many Americans, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not accurate to say that this is the only or the most pressing issue for all Americans. Other important issues include healthcare, education, racial justice, climate change, and political polarization, among others. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that in 1944 we were in debt more than twice as much as we are now is false. In 1944, the U.S. national debt was approximately $280 billion, which was about 120% of the GDP.

"Explanation: The claim about abortion is a complex issue that involves legal, ethical, and medical aspects. The truthfulness of the claim depends on the specific statement being made. For example, if the claim is ""Abortion is illegal in all 50 states,"" this would be false because abortion laws vary by state in the United States. If the claim is ""Abortion is a safe medical procedure,"" this would be true as it is a common and safe procedure when performed by trained medical professionals. Without a specific claim to evaluate, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Answer: N/A (The claim is too vague to evaluate as true or false.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of infant deaths following attempted abortions is not accurate. The Guttmacher Institute, a leading research and policy organization, reports that in 2010, there were 1,270 infant deaths due to complications from attempted abortions.

"Explanation: The claim that veterans are being treated worse than illegal immigrants is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that veterans often face challenges in accessing healthcare and other services, it is not accurate to say that they are being treated worse than illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants may face different challenges, such as lack of legal status and access to certain services, but this does not necessarily mean they are receiving better treatment than veterans. The claim is misleading and oversimplifies the issues faced by both groups.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health organizations, the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but it is not twice as much as any other nation. For example, in 2019, the U.S. spent approximately $10,966 per capita on healthcare, while countries like Switzerland and Germany spent around $5,000-$6,000 per capita. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

"Explanation: The Texas Education Agency (TEA) does not follow up to ensure that undocumented immigrants paying in-state tuition at Texas colleges are applying for permanent residency. The TEA's role is to oversee the state's public education system, including the administration of in-state tuition policies.

"Explanation: The claim that we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance annually is not accurate. According to the IRS, the total amount of money collected from taxes in the United States in 2020 was approximately $3.5 trillion. The cost of tax compliance, which includes the cost of tax preparation, tax collection, and tax enforcement, is a fraction of the total tax revenue. The military budget for the United States in 2020 was approximately $722 billion. Therefore, the claim that tax compliance costs are equal to the entire military budget is false.

"Explanation: The claim that exporters are using a federal loophole to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur to U.S. consumers is false.

Therefore, it is not possible for exporters to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur to U.S. consumers.

"Explanation: The claim that job growth in the United States is now at the fastest pace in the country's history is not accurate. While the U.S. has seen significant job growth in recent years, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not accurate to say that this is the fastest pace in the country's history. The fastest rate of job growth in the U.S. occurred in the late 1990s, with a peak of 3.2% in 1999. The most recent job growth rates have been around 2-3% per year, which is still strong but not unprecedented.

The company has cited other reasons for the move, such as the need for a larger facility to accommodate growth and the desire to be closer to its customers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not run for the presidency in 2012; he ran in 2012. The year ""2012"" is already mentioned in the claim, so it should be ""in 2012"" instead of ""On running for the presidency in 2012.""

For example, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops abroad, and Congress can vote to end the deployment. Additionally, the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed after the 9/11 attacks has been used to justify military action against various groups, including the Islamic State. Therefore, the current debate over authorizing military action against the Islamic State is not the first time Congress has placed limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to use military force.

Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that the American people overwhelmingly rejected these policies.

In fact, the U.S. has imposed economic sanctions on both countries due to their political systems and human rights records. The U.S. does provide foreign aid to other countries, but not to Cuba or Venezuela.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), does not provide Mexican citizens with stronger claims to Social Security benefits or protection against cuts compared to U.S. citizens. The agreement primarily focuses on trade and economic issues, not social security benefits. Mexican citizens would still be subject to the same rules and regulations regarding Social Security benefits as they are now, and there is no indication that they would have stronger claims or protection against cuts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in Florida refused to carry out the effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls"" is false. While there have been efforts to remove noncitizens from voter rolls in Florida, it is not accurate to say that all 67 supervisors of elections refused to participate. Some supervisors have cooperated with these efforts, while others have expressed concerns or refused to carry out certain aspects of the process. Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing votes in two different states, Wisconsin and New York, for two different candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The claim is not comparing votes within the same state or for the same candidate. Therefore, it is not possible to directly compare the votes earned by Biden in Wisconsin with the votes earned by Trump in New York.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Crist's veto clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in Florida is false. In 2021, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that prohibited the use of state funds for abortion services, including abortions performed in public hospitals. This bill was not affected by any veto from Governor Crist, who was not in office at the time. Therefore, the claim is misleading and incorrect.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Ohio House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, has not voted to change the process for drawing legislative boundaries to create objective criteria and modify the Constitution. The redistricting process in Ohio is currently controlled by the Republican-led legislature, and there is no evidence to suggest that they have voted to change the process to make it more objective or to take politics out of it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is responsible for over $14 trillion in debt is false. Debt accumulation is a result of the actions of the entire government, including the executive branch and Congress, and is not attributable to a single individual. Sen. Brown has been a member of Congress since 1993 and has served in various capacities, but the debt level is a cumulative figure that reflects the policies and actions of multiple administrations and Congresses over many years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that consumers save an average of $500 per car sold through franchised dealer model compared to direct sales by manufacturers is not universally accurate. The savings can vary greatly depending on the specific manufacturer, the model of the car, the location, and the individual dealership's pricing strategies. Additionally, direct sales by manufacturers often come with additional perks like lower overhead costs, which can sometimes offset the savings. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance both before and after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is misleading. While it is true that Wisconsin had a high rate of insurance coverage before Obamacare, the claim that the rate remained unchanged after the implementation is inaccurate. The Affordable Care Act expanded access to health insurance, particularly for low-income individuals and families, which led to an increase in the number of people with health insurance coverage. Therefore, the claim that Obamacare had no impact on insurance coverage rates is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the Atlanta Streetcar creating 1,399 jobs is based on a study conducted by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) in 2014. The study estimated that the streetcar would create 1,399 jobs during its construction and operation. This study was widely reported in local media and has been cited as a basis for the claim. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is one of the bluest states and that under Scott Walker its unemployment rate is around 3.5% is partially true. Wisconsin is indeed considered a ""blue"" state, meaning it tends to vote Democratic. However, the unemployment rate under Scott Walker, who served as governor from 2011 to 2019, was not around 3.5%. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin during his tenure varied, but it was generally higher than 3.5%. For example, in 2015, the unemployment rate was around 5.5%, and in 2019, it was around 3.2%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""I don't have lobbyists running my campaign"" is a statement made by a candidate or political figure. The truthfulness of this claim depends on the specific context and the definition of ""lobbyists."" In political campaigns, ""lobbyists"" can refer to individuals or groups who advocate for or against specific policies or candidates. If the candidate is referring to professional lobbyists who are actively working on their behalf, then the claim would be false if such individuals are indeed involved. However, if the candidate is referring to informal supporters or volunteers, the claim could be true. Without specific information about the context and the definition of ""lobbyists,"" it is not possible to definitively judge the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that alcohol is illegal for individuals under 21 in many jurisdictions, this does not mean that underage alcohol use has increased. The claim seems to imply a contradiction, suggesting that underage alcohol use has increased despite the legal prohibition. This is not supported by evidence and is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to improve access to healthcare and reduce administrative burdens. It includes provisions to ensure that patients receive timely care, including access to necessary medical services like CAT scans. The claim that a bureaucrat would delay treatment under Obamacare is not supported by the actual provisions of the law, which aim to streamline and expedite healthcare services. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true in many contexts, but not universally true.)"

"Explanation: The claim that Tammy Baldwin supports a law in which the government will take over your decisions on medicine, doctors, and hospitals is false. Tammy Baldwin, a Democratic Senator from Wisconsin, has been a strong advocate for healthcare reform, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare for All proposals. However, these proposals do not involve the government taking over individual decisions about medicine, doctors, and hospitals. Instead, they aim to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of her positions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) will cause Medicare to ""go away in less than 10 years"" is a misrepresentation of the facts. The Affordable Care Act was designed to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by reducing waste, fraud, and abuse, and by encouraging preventive care and wellness programs. The claim that Medicare will ""fall apart at the seams"" due to Obamacare is not supported by evidence or expert analysis. The Medicare Trustees' Report for 2021 projects that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted by 2026, but this is due to long-term trends in healthcare costs and demographics, not specifically due to the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Sen. John McCain did not spend the July 4 weekend in Islamabad, Pakistan, selling F-16s and advanced weapons. McCain was a prominent figure in U.S. politics and was known for his involvement in foreign policy, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he was in Pakistan during that time or that he was involved in selling weapons to the Pakistani government. Additionally, the claim that Pakistan ""harbored Osama bin Laden"" is also false, as bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in 2011, and the U.S. military operation that led to his death was conducted in Abbottabad, Pakistan, not Islamabad.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama's plan calls for ""mandates and fines for small businesses"" is false. During his presidency, Obama's administration implemented the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which included provisions for small businesses to provide health insurance to their employees. However, the ACA did not mandate that all small businesses provide health insurance, nor did it impose fines specifically for small businesses that did not comply with the law. The fines were primarily targeted at larger businesses that did not offer health insurance to their employees.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the area near the proposed northern Wisconsin iron ore mine is 15 hours away from where the public hearing on mining was held. This claim is false because the distance between two locations is typically measured in miles or kilometers, not hours. The time it takes to travel between two locations depends on the mode of transportation and the speed at which it travels. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine the distance between two locations using hours as the unit of measurement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Our credit rating went up since I've been in office"" is a subjective statement that depends on the specific context and the time frame in question. Credit ratings are influenced by various economic factors and policies, and it's not always clear whether a specific leader's actions directly led to an improvement in the credit rating. Therefore, without specific data or evidence, it's difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that African-American children are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids is an exaggeration. While it is true that African-American children are disproportionately affected by asthma, the mortality rate is not 500 percent higher. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), African-American children are about 2.5 times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma and 2.5 times more likely to die from asthma than white children. This is a significant disparity, but it is not 500 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of people killed by U.S. police in a single month to the number killed by U.K. police over a century. This is a misleading comparison because it does not account for the population size, the time period, or the context of each country's law enforcement practices. The U.S. has a much larger population and a higher rate of police interactions, which would naturally lead to a higher number of deaths. The U.K., on the other hand, has a smaller population and a different legal and cultural context. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios is false. In fact, the Rhode Island General Assembly did debate and vote on the loan.

This information is well-documented in various news reports and official records.

These figures are derived from the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's annual report to Congress, which provides an analysis of the cost of compliance with the federal tax system.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida has the second-lowest campaign contribution limit in the entire country is false.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the potential effects of the stadium's development.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies, specifically corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns and got $570 million in job-development incentives, is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that Scott Walker's administration provided job-development incentives to various businesses, including those that had contributed to his campaigns, the claim that $570 million was specifically given to his cronies is not supported by verifiable evidence. The amount of $570 million is not explicitly tied to his cronies or campaign contributors in any publicly available records or reports.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Burger King is pulling its franchises from military bases due to actions by President Barack Obama is false.

"Explanation: The claim that a 2005 gay pride vote had nothing to do with discrimination is false. The 2005 gay pride vote was a significant event in the history of LGBTQ+ rights, and it was directly related to discrimination.

The vote was a show of support for the LGBTQ+ community and a protest against the discrimination and inequality they faced.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the current staff size of 51 with the staff size a decade ago.

The birther controversy, which questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama, began during his 2008 presidential campaign.

The birther movement was primarily led by conservative political figures and individuals who questioned Obama's eligibility to be president.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about surveys conducted with Wisconsin employers. While it is possible that some employers have cited the anti-business litigation climate as a factor affecting their expansion decisions, it is not specific enough to be verified as true or false without additional context or data.

"Explanation: The claim that the Pasco County budget has doubled in the past three years is not accurate.

For example, the budget for the 2019-2020 fiscal year was approximately $1.2 billion, and the budget for the 2022-2023 fiscal year was approximately $1.4 billion. This represents an increase of about 16.7%, not a doubling.

"Explanation: The claim that there were no government benefits for immigrants when the grandfather arrived in the United States is false. While it is true that the current system of government benefits for immigrants is more extensive than it was in the past, there were indeed some forms of assistance available to immigrants in the early 20th century. For example, the Dillingham Commission, established in 1907, recommended that immigrants be provided with assistance in finding jobs and housing. Additionally, some states and cities offered assistance to immigrants through public works programs and other initiatives. Therefore, the claim that there were no government benefits for immigrants is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal aid for Medicaid expansion is not a tax that can be redirected to other states. Medicaid is a federal program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals and families. When a state chooses not to expand Medicaid, it does not send federal funds to other states. Instead, the federal funds remain with the state that chose not to expand Medicaid. The claim is a misinterpretation of how Medicaid funding works.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""a third of all the young people in America are not in America today because of abortion"" is misleading and inaccurate. While it is true that one in three pregnancies in the United States end in abortion, this does not mean that one in three young people are not in America today due to abortion. The claim confuses the number of pregnancies that end in abortion with the number of young people who are not in America. The number of young people in America is not directly affected by the number of abortions.

The current federal gas tax rate is 18.4 cents per gallon for regular gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel fuel, which was last increased in 1993. However, the claim that the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993 is false because it has been raised multiple times since then, including in 1993 itself.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker's budget includes ""No weekend for workers"" is a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual policy. Scott Walker, a former governor of Wisconsin, implemented a policy that required state employees to work on Saturdays and Sundays, but this was not a complete elimination of weekends for workers. The policy was aimed at reducing the state's budget deficit and did not mean that all workers would have no weekend at all. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did not give control of Medicare patients' healthcare decisions to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats. The ACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was intended to make recommendations to Congress on how to reduce Medicare spending. However, the IPAB was never activated, and its powers were repealed in 2019. The claim misrepresents the role and existence of the IPAB.

This practice would be a violation of government ethics rules and could be seen as a conflict of interest.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that in 41 states, government workers are better paid than the taxpayers who support them is not accurate. While it is true that government workers often have higher salaries and benefits compared to private sector workers, the claim that this is true in 41 states is an oversimplification and not supported by comprehensive data. The claim does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement, making it difficult to verify its accuracy.

Mitt Romney, during his 2012 presidential campaign, did propose a plan to deny in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, but he did not explicitly say ""'No' to in-state tuition"" in the way the claim suggests. The claim is a misrepresentation of Romney's stance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about a specific demographic group (single adults, ages 21 to 25 with no kids) and does not provide any specific data or source to support the claim.

"Explanation: The claim that President Obama plans to impose a tax of at least 23 percent on the Medicare prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries is false. There is no evidence or official statement from President Obama or his administration indicating such a plan.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario and does not provide any specific source or data to support it. President Obama's policies were in effect during the 2008-2016 period, and the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 4.7%. The claim does not provide any evidence or data to suggest that continuing with his policies would lead to a 9% unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the following year.

"Explanation: The claim is asking for an opinion on how the federal government should spend Florida's rejected high-speed rail money. This is a subjective and political question that does not have a definitive true or false answer.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Barack Obama has enacted a law that requires healthcare professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government for the purpose of gun confiscation. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law by President Obama, does not include such provisions. Additionally, the ACA does not give the government the authority to confiscate guns based on medical data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of the latest data, the population of Florida is indeed approximately 19 million people. The combined population of the earlier primary and caucus states (such as Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada) is significantly less than 19 million.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct and arbitrary comparison between the cost of an ESD superintendent position and the cost of three speech pathologists, three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers. This comparison is not valid because the roles, responsibilities, and qualifications required for these positions are vastly different. The cost of each position is determined by various factors such as education, experience, and the specific needs of the role, not by a simple numerical ratio. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama Administration did not close 75 percent of the air traffic control towers in Republican Congressional Districts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954 is false. Crimea has a complex history, but it was not part of Ukraine until 1954. Before that, it was part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union. In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev, then the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, transferred Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR as part of a territorial reorganization within the Soviet Union. This transfer was not a gift or a gesture but a formal administrative decision.

"Explanation: The claim is true. A fiduciary responsibility is a legal and ethical obligation to act in the best interests of another party. In the context of a business, this means that the individual has a duty to act in the best interests of the business, its employees, and its shareholders. Paying no more tax than legally required is a way to maximize the value of the business, which aligns with the fiduciary responsibility.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Rick Scott was not forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud. In fact, Rick Scott was the Governor of Florida from 2011 to 2019 and has not been involved in any such fraud case.

"Explanation: The claim that the federal government restricts how much salt we can put on our food is false. While the U.S. government does recommend limiting salt intake to reduce health risks, it does not impose specific restrictions on the amount of salt individuals can use in their food. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day, but this is a recommendation, not a regulation.

"Explanation: The claim is about a specific incident involving a 42-inch redfish and fishing rules. Without additional context or verification, it's difficult to determine the authenticity of this claim. However, the claim itself is not inherently impossible; it's plausible that someone could catch a 42-inch redfish and be unable to keep it due to fishing regulations.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim about the accuracy of state job numbers is complex and depends on the specific context and data source. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, for example, regularly releases data on employment and unemployment rates, which are considered reliable and accurate. However, the accuracy of state-specific job numbers can vary depending on the methodology used by individual states and the reliability of their data collection processes. Therefore, without specific details about the source and methodology of the claim, it is difficult to definitively judge its accuracy.

The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the data.

"Explanation: The claim that the No. 1 cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34 is murder is not accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading causes of death for African-American males in this age group are homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries. However, homicide is not the No. 1 cause of death overall. The CDC's data shows that unintentional injuries, such as motor vehicle accidents, are the leading cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34.

"Explanation: Ron Johnson, a former CEO of J.C. Penney and a current U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has been actively involved in addressing opioid abuse and heroin addiction. He has introduced legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis, such as the ""Opioid Crisis Response Act"" and the ""Opioid Addiction Prevention Act."" Additionally, he has been vocal about the issue and has participated in various discussions and hearings on the topic. Therefore, the claim that he has done nothing to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While Virginia has been recognized for its business-friendly environment and has been ranked high in various surveys, it has not been named ""best managed state"" or ""best state to raise a child"" during the tenure of any specific governor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit is false. This claim originated from a series of videos released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress in 2015. However, multiple investigations, including those by the FBI and the Department of Justice, found no evidence to support the claim. The videos were later found to have been heavily edited and misrepresented the context of the conversations. Planned Parenthood has consistently denied the allegations and has stated that it does not sell fetal tissue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the new 21st State Senate district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard and was drawn within half a block of his house is a political allegation that lacks specific evidence or official confirmation.

Without concrete evidence or official statements supporting this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Jeff Greene only moved from California to Florida in the last two years and that he would not legally be allowed to run for any other statewide office because he has not lived here long enough to meet the residency requirement. This claim is false because Jeff Greene has been a resident of Florida for more than two years. He has been a resident of Florida since 2018, which means he has met the residency requirement for running for statewide office.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The individual in question, George W. Bush, was the President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 and was a strong supporter of the war in Iraq.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Fifty-one percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009"" is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, in 2009, approximately 46.4% of tax returns did not report any taxable income, which means they did not owe any income tax. However, this does not mean that 51% of households paid no income tax, as some households may have had taxable income but did not owe any tax due to credits or deductions.

Answer: 0"

While it is true that abortion services are a significant part of Planned Parenthood's work, the claim that 86 percent of their revenue comes from abortion is an exaggeration. According to Planned Parenthood's own financial reports, abortion services account for about 32 percent of their total revenue. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual figures.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Georgia spends more on tourism advertising than many other states in the South. For example, in 2019, Georgia spent $15.5 million on tourism advertising, while states like Alabama and South Carolina spent less.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unionization rate for all private industry workers in the United States is around 6.5%, while the rate for foreign-owned companies is around 5.5%. This indicates that foreign-owned companies have a slightly lower unionization rate than the overall private industry rate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Federal grant funds for the Milwaukee streetcar project are subject to specific conditions and restrictions, but they are not exclusively tied to the streetcar project. The funds can be redirected to other modes of public transportation or to public schools if the project is canceled or if the funds are not used as intended. The claim suggests a rigid restriction that does not align with typical grant fund usage policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's deal allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon is false. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

"Explanation: The claim that ""nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything"" when the United States first created the federal income tax is false. The federal income tax was implemented in 1913 with the 16th Amendment, and it initially applied to a broad range of incomes. The first tax brackets were set at 1% for incomes up to $3,000, 2% for incomes up to $5,000, and 6% for incomes above $5,000. Therefore, individuals with incomes below $3,000 did not pay any federal income tax, but those with incomes above $3,000 did pay a tax.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that there are over 300 state agencies, and 45 of those are related to healthcare.

"Explanation: The claim that ""government is a barrier to innovation and development"" is not universally true. While it is true that excessive regulation, bureaucracy, or lack of support can hinder innovation, governments also play a crucial role in fostering innovation through policies, funding, and infrastructure. For instance, many governments provide funding for research and development, create regulatory environments that encourage innovation, and invest in education and infrastructure. Therefore, the claim is not accurate in its entirety.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in inner-city schools is not accurate. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the overall dropout rate for public schools in the United States was around 5% in 2019. While dropout rates can vary significantly by location and demographic, the claim of a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that individuals should unconditionally follow police orders and then deal with any potential issues later. This advice is not accurate and can be dangerous. When a police officer stops you, it is important to remain calm and cooperative, but you also have rights. You should not feel compelled to follow orders that you believe are illegal or unjust. If you feel that your rights are being violated, you should document the incident and seek legal advice.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Ohio does not have a law that explicitly allows employers or landlords to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: In Georgia, ride-sharing companies like Uber are required to carry auto insurance. However, the specifics of the insurance coverage can vary depending on the status of the driver (e.g., whether they are currently driving for the company or are off-duty). When a driver is logged into the app and waiting for a ride request, the company's insurance coverage typically applies. When the driver is off-duty, the driver's personal insurance may cover them. Therefore, the claim that Uber and other ride-share firms are not required to carry auto insurance under Georgia law is false.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey has the lowest corruption risk of any state due to the #jerseycomeback is not verifiable with the information provided. The #jerseycomeback is a hashtag used to promote a return to normalcy and economic recovery in New Jersey, but it does not directly correlate to a reduction in corruption risk.

Without specific data or sources to support the claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a referendum on an aquarium for Clearwater will directly impact future funding for neighborhoods.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Gov. McAuliffe has vetoed more bills in two years than the previous three governors did in each of their four-year terms. To verify this claim, we would need to compare the number of bills vetoed by Gov. McAuliffe in his first two years in office with the total number of bills vetoed by the previous three governors in their four-year terms. Without specific data on the number of bills vetoed by each governor, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Everything I have said (on the campaign trail) has been factually accurate"" is a subjective statement that cannot be universally verified as true or false without specific examples and context.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security system was established in the United States in 1935, during the Great Depression. The average life expectancy at that time was around 61 years for men and 62 years for women. However, the Social Security system was designed to provide benefits to workers who had contributed to the system through payroll taxes. The age at which people could start receiving benefits was initially set at 65, which was higher than the average life expectancy at the time. Therefore, the claim that people died before they were old enough to get Social Security is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate was in 1972, as stated in the claim. However, the claim also states that ""We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate,"" which implies that the 40th anniversary is approaching. Since 1972 was 40 years ago, the claim is false because it suggests that the anniversary is still approaching, which is not the case.

In 2009, the Department of Justice under Holder's leadership did not dismiss the charges against the New Black Panther Party.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that a person can drive the length of a football field (approximately 100 yards or 91.44 meters) in five seconds. This is highly unlikely because the average speed required to cover this distance in five seconds would be approximately 182.88 meters per second, which is far beyond the capabilities of any vehicle, including a car or a motorcycle. Even the fastest cars in the world cannot achieve such speeds.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the water sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 was equivalent to three years' worth of Austin's water use. This claim is misleading because it does not specify the total amount of water used by Austin in a year. Without knowing the total annual water usage of Austin, it is impossible to accurately compare the water sent to downstream rice farmers to three years' worth of Austin's water use. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Wisconsin does not require a photographic identification to vote. The state allows voters to present a variety of identification documents, including non-photographic ones, such as utility bills, bank statements, or pay stubs. This policy is in line with the state's voter ID law, which was implemented in 2011 but has since been modified to allow for a broader range of acceptable identification documents.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that learning about Donald Trump's financial dealings can be better understood by examining his financial disclosure form rather than his tax returns. This is false because financial disclosure forms and tax returns serve different purposes and provide different types of information. Financial disclosure forms provide details about assets, liabilities, and income sources, while tax returns provide information about income, deductions, and taxes paid. Both are important for understanding a person's financial situation, but they are not interchangeable. Therefore, the claim is false.

In law schools, women accounted for 49.5% of the student population in 2019-2020. Therefore, the claim that over half of the young people in medical, dental, and law schools are women is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, recall petitions are governed by state laws, and the specific rules can vary. However, in most states, including Wisconsin where Governor Scott Walker was governor, a person can only sign one recall petition for a single elected official. Signing multiple petitions for the same official is not allowed, and only the first signature counts. Therefore, the claim that it is legal to sign a recall petition even if you have already signed another recall petition is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident is true. The U.S. Navy has been operating nuclear-powered ships since the 1950s, and while there have been incidents and accidents involving nuclear reactors, none have resulted in a significant release of radioactive material. The most notable incident was the 1968 nuclear accident on the USS Thresher, which resulted in the loss of the ship and its crew, but this was not a result of a nuclear accident but rather a mechanical failure. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

The House health reform bill, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), does not put new restrictions on women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market.

"Explanation: The claim that a particular state was the ""worst"" in moving people from welfare to work is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""worst."" Without specific data or context, it's impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

"Explanation: The claim that the Social Security disability fund is going belly up in 2016 is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been reporting that the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, which finances Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), is expected to be depleted by 2034, not 2016. This misinformation is likely due to confusion or misinterpretation of the SSA's reports.

"Explanation: The claim that 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day is an exaggeration. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the suicide rate among veterans is approximately 20 per day, but this figure is not exclusive to older veterans and includes all veterans.

"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language is false. While the U.S. does not have an official language at the federal level, it is not accurate to say that it is one of the very few nations without an official language.

"Explanation: The claim that the Florida Legislature raised taxes and fees by almost $2 billion in the 2009 session is false. According to the Florida Senate's official website and various news reports from 2009, the 2009 legislative session did not result in a $2 billion increase in taxes and fees. The session primarily focused on budget cuts and other measures to address the state's financial situation during the economic downturn.

"Explanation: The claim that the fastest-growing part of the Pentagon's budget are health care expenses is false. The Pentagon's budget primarily consists of expenses related to defense operations, procurement, and personnel costs, not health care.

"Explanation: The Medicare program was passed in 1965 as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965. While it is true that the bill had significant Democratic support, it also had some Republican support. The bill was passed with a vote of 307-116 in the House of Representatives and 57-21 in the Senate. While it is accurate to say that the bill had virtually no Republican support in the sense that the majority of Republicans voted against it, it is not entirely accurate to say that it passed with virtually no Republican support.

"Explanation: The claim that ""More businesses went out of business last year than were started for the first time in our history"" is not accurate. While it is true that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant number of business closures, it is not accurate to say that more businesses went out of business than were started. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of business applications for employer identification numbers (EINs) in 2020 was higher than in any previous year, indicating that more businesses were started than in previous years. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Houston National Cemetery is preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals is false. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which manages national cemeteries, allows for religious leaders to conduct prayers at military funerals.

"Explanation: The claim that Mitch McConnell is the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is a generalization and an oversimplification. While it is true that Mitch McConnell has received significant donations from individuals and organizations associated with the coal industry, it is not accurate to say that he is the only candidate receiving such donations. Many other political figures, including those from both major parties, have received donations from various industries, including coal. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The national debt of the United States is approximately $16 trillion, and if we were to convert this into $1 bills, it would not cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times. The area of Ohio is approximately 44,829 square miles. If we assume each $1 bill has a thickness of 0.0043 inches (the thickness of a typical U.S. banknote), the volume of $1 bills needed to cover Ohio would be far greater than the volume of the state itself. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. During his presidency, he did reach across party lines to achieve significant legislation. For example, he worked with Republicans to pass the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Additionally, he signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was a bipartisan effort. Therefore, the claim that he ""has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa is false. The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) is a non-profit organization that works to improve access to HIV/AIDS treatment in resource-limited settings. It has been involved in providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that CHAI distributed watered-down drugs. The organization has been recognized for its efforts in improving access to quality HIV/AIDS treatment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study of private bail bond systems, which suggests that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states. However, without specific details about the study, its methodology, and the data used, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. Additionally, no-show rates can be influenced by various factors such as the severity of the crime, the defendant's personal circumstances, and the effectiveness of the bail bond system itself. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false without further information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that scientists are now advising to leave nuclear waste where it is, implying that the problem of nuclear waste disposal has been solved. However, this is a simplification and not entirely accurate. While some scientists and experts have proposed various methods for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, including leaving it in place under certain conditions, the consensus is that the problem is far from solved. The storage and disposal of nuclear waste remain significant challenges in the field of nuclear energy. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely true.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average price of regular gasoline in the United States has been higher in the past, particularly in the 2008 and 2011-2014 periods. The current prices are indeed high, but they are not unprecedented.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States uses the Electoral College system to elect the President, where each state's electoral votes are allocated based on its representation in Congress. Texas, California, and New York have a combined total of 55 electoral votes, which is more than half of the 538 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. However, it is not mathematically impossible for Republicans to elect a president because the remaining states could still vote for a Republican candidate, and the candidate could win the majority of electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""close to 90 percent of the population growth in Texas over the last decade was non-Anglo"" is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Texas grew by approximately 10.5 million people between 2010 and 2020. While it is true that a significant portion of this growth is due to immigration, the claim that 90 percent of this growth was non-Anglo is an overstatement. The actual percentage of non-Anglo population growth is likely to be higher than the Anglo population growth, but it is not accurate to say that 90 percent of the total growth was non-Anglo.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The bipartisan background check amendment, known as the ""Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,"" does not outlaw any gun registry. The act expands background checks to cover more individuals, including those who purchase guns at gun shows and online, but it does not prohibit the creation or maintenance of gun registries. The claim misinterprets the legislation's intent and content.

Therefore, the claim is true.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of BLS data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons because the United States of America said it would ensure its territorial integrity from Russia is true. This is a well-documented historical event. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom. This agreement was formalized in the Budapest Memorandum, where the signatory states (the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom) agreed to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual number of individuals who were subjected to waterboarding.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that ""nobody in higher education believes Gov. Rick Perry's proposal to serve up $10,000 college degrees is possible"" is a generalization that is not supported by evidence. While there may be some critics or skeptics of the proposal, it is not accurate to say that ""nobody"" in higher education believes it is possible. The proposal has been discussed and debated by various stakeholders in higher education, including educators, administrators, and policymakers. Some may support the idea, while others may have concerns or criticisms. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the total number of violent crimes in Arizona decreased from 2019 to 2020. However, property crimes increased slightly.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: To evaluate the claim, I would need to compare the salaries of faculty members across different universities in New England. However, without specific data or a reliable source, it is challenging to verify the claim.

If the claim is based on a reliable source, it would be true; otherwise, it would be false.

Lincoln did propose a plan to compensate slave owners for freeing their slaves, but this was not a direct attempt to buy slaves' freedom.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: A 5-cent charge on paper bags is not a tax. A tax is a compulsory financial charge or levy imposed by a government authority on a person or organization for the purpose of raising revenue. A charge on paper bags is typically a fee or surcharge imposed by a retailer or a local government to encourage the use of reusable bags and reduce waste. It is not a tax because it is not imposed by a government authority for the purpose of raising revenue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the U.N. arms treaty will mandate a new international gun registry is false. The United Nations has been working on an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) since 2012, but it does not include provisions for a global gun registry. The ATT aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, but it does not require countries to establish a global registry of firearms. The treaty focuses on transparency and record-keeping in the arms trade, not on individual gun ownership.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that Rick Scott did not attend his own education summit but attended a Tea Party convention instead.

"Explanation: The 9-9-9 plan, proposed by Andrew Yang, is a tax reform plan that includes a universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 per month for every American adult. The plan also includes a 10% value-added tax (VAT) on goods and services, and a 10% tax on corporate income. While the UBI component does not raise taxes on those making the least, the VAT and corporate tax increases would indeed raise taxes on many Americans. Therefore, the claim that the 9-9-9 plan does not raise taxes on those making the least is false.

The claim could be true or false depending on the specific context and the person making the statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government borrows almost $60 billion per week is false. The U.S. federal government's borrowing is typically measured in terms of the debt ceiling and the deficit, not weekly borrowing. The U.S. Treasury Department reports the federal debt on a daily basis, and the weekly borrowing figures are not a standard measure. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the federal debt.

The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm also decreased, but the percentage is not specified in the FBI report. Therefore, the claim that the number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has declined by nearly 70% is not supported by the data.

However, the claim suggests that the U.S. spends more than the next 10, 11, or 12 countries combined, which is not accurate. The U.S. spends more than the next 10 countries combined, but not the next 11 or 12.

"Explanation: The claim states that property taxes in 2009 were $3 billion below those in 2007 due to tax cuts and lower property values. However, without specific data or sources to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Property tax rates and values can be influenced by various factors, and a decrease of $3 billion over two years is a significant change that would typically require detailed economic analysis and data to substantiate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that food stamp spending doubled under President Bush and doubled again under President Obama is not accurate. While it is true that food stamp spending increased significantly during both administrations, the claim of doubling is an oversimplification. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food stamp spending increased from $30 billion in 2001 to $78 billion in 2009 under President Bush, and then to $80 billion in 2013 under President Obama. This represents a significant increase, but not a doubling in each case.

"Explanation: The claim that the cost of a college education increased by 439 percent between 1982 and 2007 is based on a study by the College Board, which reported that the cost of tuition and fees at public institutions increased by 439 percent over that period. However, this figure includes only tuition and fees, not room and board, which are also significant components of the total cost of attendance. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of tuition and fees, it is misleading because it does not account for the full cost of attendance.

In the United States, tips are typically distributed to employees, including baristas, through a system called ""tip pooling.""

"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. loses more on tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes is not accurate. According to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the total amount of tax breaks (or tax expenditures) in the U.S. is significantly less than the total amount of personal income taxes collected. For example, in 2019, the IRS reported that the total amount of tax expenditures was approximately $1.6 trillion, while the total amount of personal income taxes collected was around $1.4 trillion. Therefore, the U.S. does not lose more on tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes.

"Explanation: The claim that taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals in California are ""a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare"" is misleading. While it is true that some undocumented immigrants may receive certain benefits, such as emergency medical care, it is not accurate to say that these benefits are a ""skyrocketing cost under Obamacare."" Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not provide benefits to undocumented immigrants. The ACA primarily provides benefits to U.S. citizens and legal residents. Additionally, the cost of benefits for undocumented immigrants is not funded by taxpayers but rather by the undocumented immigrants themselves through their own contributions to the healthcare system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""every income tax bracket will increase on Jan. 1, 2011"" is not accurate. The 2010 Tax Relief Act, which was signed into law by President Obama, extended the Bush-era tax cuts for two years, but it did not increase all income tax brackets. The tax cuts were extended for most taxpayers, but some high-income individuals saw their tax rates increase. Therefore, the claim that ""every income tax bracket will increase"" is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim that Jeanne Shaheen was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama's political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election is false. The IRS scandal, also known as the ""IRS targeting scandal,"" involved the IRS's practice of scrutinizing conservative and liberal nonprofit groups differently. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Jeanne Shaheen was involved in this plot. The investigation into the IRS targeting scandal did not implicate Jeanne Shaheen.

This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of the group's activities.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Bridge to Nowhere"" was a project that was proposed by Alaska Senator Ted Stevens in 2005. The project was intended to build a bridge to the remote island of Gravina in the Aleutian Islands. However, the project was highly controversial and was eventually canceled. The claim that the senator was one of a dozen who voted against the project is incorrect because the project was never voted on by the Senate.

While there have been discussions and proposals within the Republican Party to modify or reform Medicare, there is no current plan or proposal to completely end the program.

"Explanation: The claim that Tennessee's higher education funding model is 100 percent outcomes-based and that this model is already changing the way postsecondary institutions do business is not entirely accurate. While Tennessee has implemented a performance-based funding model, it is not exclusively outcomes-based. The model includes factors such as student retention, graduation rates, and other performance metrics, but it also considers other factors like institutional size and student demographics. Therefore, the claim that it is 100 percent outcomes-based is an overstatement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Islanders pay among the highest auto repair bills in the nation is not supported by reliable data. While Rhode Island may have higher costs for certain services, it is not accurate to say that it consistently ranks among the highest in the nation. Costs for auto repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific service, the location within the state, and the type of vehicle. Therefore, the claim is not true.

"Explanation: The claim that the Ryan budget gets rid of Medicare in 10 years and turns it into a voucher program is false. The Ryan budget, proposed by then-Rep. Paul Ryan in 2011, did propose changes to Medicare, including a shift to a voucher system for future beneficiaries. However, it did not eliminate Medicare entirely. The voucher system would have provided beneficiaries with a set amount to purchase private insurance, but Medicare would have continued to exist for current beneficiaries. The claim that Medicare would be eliminated in 10 years is a misrepresentation of the Ryan budget's proposals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the increase in the garbage tax imposed by Mayor Allan Fung in Cranston being as much as $200 is not supported by any reliable sources.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA does not require Americans to give up their current health plans. Instead, it provides options for those who may not have access to affordable coverage or want to change their plans. The prediction that 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan is a misrepresentation of the ACA's impact. The ACA aims to expand coverage, not to force people to change their plans.

Answer: 0"

To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting records of the legislator for any tax increase bills they voted on.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be accurately judged as true or false.

Answer: N/A"
"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. is spending millions for each individual held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is not accurate. The cost of detaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay is not primarily based on the number of detainees but rather on the overall operational costs of the facility. The U.S. government has not publicly disclosed the exact cost per detainee, but it is known that the total cost of the detention facility and operations is significant. However, the claim that spending is directly proportional to the number of detainees is misleading.

This statement, among others, demonstrates that he did indeed use the term.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Senate opponent Tammy Baldwin supported a federal budget that spent trillions more money than the Obama budget is misleading. The federal budget for the fiscal year 2021, which was signed into law by President Biden, was approximately $4.8 trillion. The federal budget for the fiscal year 2016, which was the last full year of the Obama administration, was approximately $3.9 trillion. While the 2021 budget is larger than the 2016 budget, the difference is not in the trillions but rather in the hundreds of billions. Additionally, the claim does not specify which budget Tammy Baldwin supported, and her voting record does not indicate support for a budget that spent trillions more than the Obama budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The debt increased by 100% under President Obama, not 23%. The debt increased from $10.6 trillion to $19.9 trillion during his presidency, which is a 90% increase. The claim also incorrectly states that this was less than under any president going back to Ronald Reagan. In fact, the debt increased by 100% under George W. Bush and by 100% under Ronald Reagan.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you spent only $36.29 on your campaign for governor is highly unlikely. Campaigns for governor, especially in the United States, typically involve significant expenditures.

Therefore, this claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the number of terrorists has doubled is not supported by reliable data or sources.

"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion a year in Florida, and that this amounts to $700 for every household in Florida, is based on a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR).

The study's calculations are not universally accepted, and the actual costs of illegal immigration are subject to debate. Therefore, the claim cannot be considered definitively true without further verification and context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The bill in question, known as the Continuing Resolution (CR), did not include funding for Planned Parenthood.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""We already have $23 billion worth of debt"" is not specific enough to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. The term ""we"" is ambiguous and could refer to a country, a company, or an individual. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time period or the entity to which the debt belongs. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of this claim without more information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require industry approval before issuing a recall.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wall Street hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a sheet metal worker in Parma or a school teacher in Cleveland is generally true. Hedge fund managers often have access to various tax strategies and deductions that can lower their effective tax rates. For example, they may use complex investment structures, such as partnerships and LLCs, which can provide significant tax advantages. On the other hand, the sheet metal worker and school teacher typically have more straightforward tax situations, with less opportunity for tax avoidance strategies. Therefore, the claim is supported by the general principles of tax law and the different tax treatment of various income sources.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Harry Reid and Senate Democrats only took action on veteran healthcare after news broke about veterans dying due to inadequate care is a simplification of the timeline of events. While it is true that the issue gained significant attention and momentum after reports of veteran deaths, it is not accurate to say that no action was taken before. In fact, there have been ongoing efforts and legislation related to veteran healthcare for many years. The claim also overlooks the broader context of political and legislative processes that involve multiple factors and stakeholders.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Rick Perry, the former Governor of Texas, has publicly stated that he believes in the right of states to secede from the union.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that a Medicaid provision added to the Senate health care reform bill is ""not a special deal for Nebraska"" is false. The provision in question, known as the Nebraska Option, was indeed a special deal for Nebraska. It allowed the state to keep its existing Medicaid program, which was more generous than the standard Medicaid program, and receive federal funding to cover the costs. This provision was included in the bill to secure Nebraska's support for the legislation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump required every school in America to let people carry guns into classrooms on his very first day in office is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is a business advocacy group. The report's findings are often criticized for being overly pessimistic and not accounting for potential economic benefits or job creation in other sectors. The specific figures of 244,000 jobs lost and $1,200 additional cost per family are disputed by many economists and environmental groups. The Chamber of Commerce's reports are often used to argue against environmental regulations, but their methodology and conclusions are not universally accepted.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a Massachusetts governor erasing electronic communications as he left office. This practice is not uncommon among public officials, as it is often done to protect personal privacy and avoid potential misuse of public records. However, the claim does not specify which governor or provide any evidence to support the claim. Therefore, without specific details or evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim's authenticity.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""many states are floundering under crushing deficit spending"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While some states may indeed face significant budgetary challenges, it's not accurate to say that ""many"" states are in this situation.

"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton has said that NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) was a boon to the economy is false. Hillary Clinton has been critical of NAFTA throughout her political career, including during her 2016 presidential campaign.

The executive action, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), was announced by President Obama in November 2014. However, it was blocked by a federal court and never went into effect. Sen. Begich did not play a role in the decision-making process regarding this executive action.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the U.S. economy has shown signs of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, with GDP growth and employment figures improving. However, the pace of recovery can vary depending on the specific economic indicators and sectors being considered. Europe, on the other hand, has also been recovering, but the pace of recovery can differ between countries and regions within Europe. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the U.S. economy is recovering slower than Europe overall, as the recovery rates can be comparable or even faster in some European countries.

"Explanation: The claim states that the building in question is not a mosque but a cultural center with a prayer area. This claim is true because a mosque is a place of worship specifically for Muslims, while a cultural center can be a place for various cultural activities and may include a prayer area for Muslims.

The claim of 1 in 3.27 is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual odds.

Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

"Explanation: The claim that the United States had declared war on Islam over 200 years ago and that Thomas Jefferson led the charge is false. The United States has never declared war on Islam as a whole. The Barbary Wars, which were fought in the early 19th century, were conflicts between the United States and the Barbary States (Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli) over piracy and tribute. Thomas Jefferson was involved in these conflicts, but they were not directed against Islam as a religion. The claim misrepresents the historical context and the role of Thomas Jefferson.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Latino population in Texas is indeed growing rapidly, and it is projected to become the largest ethnic group in the state by 2025.

While it is true that the craft beer segment has been growing significantly in recent years, other segments of the beer market, such as premium and imported beer segments, have also shown growth.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the claim that a $15-an-hour proposal in Cleveland is the most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country is not accurate. While Cleveland has proposed a significant increase in its minimum wage, there are other cities and states that have implemented or proposed even higher minimum wages. For example, Seattle has a minimum wage of $15 per hour, and some states like California have proposed or implemented higher minimum wages. Therefore, the claim that Cleveland's proposal is the most aggressive is not true.

This data suggests that the claim is exaggerated and not supported by reliable sources.

As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that Senator McCain has proposed or is advocating for an increase in the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his actual policy positions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there are mandatory ultrasounds before abortions is false. While some states in the United States have laws requiring ultrasounds before abortions, these are not mandatory nationwide. The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) struck down a Texas law that required ultrasounds before abortions, and similar laws in other states have been challenged or struck down as well. Therefore, the claim that there are mandatory ultrasounds before abortions is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's State Department sent three comedians to India on the ""Make Chai, Not War"" tour is false. There is no evidence or record of such an event.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the intelligence community can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism is false. The U.S. intelligence community, including the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is subject to strict legal and regulatory oversight to prevent the collection of information on law-abiding Americans without a valid legal basis. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and other laws require a specific legal process and probable cause to collect information on U.S. citizens. The collection of business records on law-abiding Americans without a connection to terrorism would violate these laws and regulations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific incident involving Wisconsin state Sen. Jim Holperin and recall petitions. While it is possible for such incidents to occur, the claim itself does not provide concrete evidence or sources to verify the authenticity of the harassment. Without specific details or credible sources, it is difficult to confirm the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, Virginia's state and local governments contributed 47.5% of the total funding for public education, while the federal government contributed 8.3%. The remaining 44.2% was covered by local sources. Therefore, Virginia is not responsible for funding 55% of public education and is not paying just 41%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that uncompensated care has gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months of Medicaid expansion in the states that adopted it is not accurate. While Medicaid expansion has been shown to reduce uncompensated care, the 30 percent figure is not supported by reliable data or studies. The actual reduction in uncompensated care varies by state and is typically in the range of 10-20 percent, according to studies by the Commonwealth Fund and other reputable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a generalization and does not provide specific data or examples to support its assertion. Economic growth and tax policy are influenced by numerous factors, and correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time capital gains tax has been cut, the economy has grown, or that raising it has damaged the economy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information or credible sources that confirm that David Axelrod has become a campaign advisor for Jason Carter.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is the first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials is false. The term ""czar"" is often used to describe high-ranking officials in the executive branch who are appointed by the president. While it is true that Obama appointed a number of czars, the number 45 is not accurate. The actual number of czars appointed by Obama is around 20-25, depending on the source and the definition of ""czar."" Additionally, the claim that these czars replaced elected officials is misleading, as czars are typically appointed to oversee specific policy areas and do not replace elected officials.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida seniors are exempt from losing Medicare Advantage under the federal health care bill is false. The Medicare Advantage program is a part of the Medicare program that provides health coverage through private insurance companies. The federal health care bill, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not exempt Florida seniors from losing Medicare Advantage. The ACA actually expanded Medicare Advantage by providing additional benefits and protections for beneficiaries. Therefore, the claim is false.

This claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general perception of public opinion rather than specific data. While it is true that many people in the U.S. believe in more equitable distribution of wealth, the exact figure of ""nearly 6 out of 10"" is not supported by any specific survey or study. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and can be considered as potentially false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The president in question is Joe Biden, and he has indeed criticized Israel for its settlement activities in the West Bank. However, he has also addressed the rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip. In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021, Biden condemned the rocket attacks and called for a ceasefire. Therefore, the claim that he said nothing about the rocket attacks is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation"" is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""most restrictive."" Voter ID laws can vary in their requirements, such as the types of IDs accepted, the process for obtaining IDs, and the penalties for non-compliance. Without specific details about the bill in question and a comparison with other voter ID laws across the nation, it is not possible to definitively determine if this bill is the most restrictive.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a personal recommendation made by the speaker, which is not a verifiable fact.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts is partially true. The federal government has provided funding and equipment to local law enforcement agencies through programs like the 1033 Program, which allows the transfer of excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that this year's redistricting process in Tennessee has been the most open, interactive, and transparent in history is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""most open,"" ""most interactive,"" and ""most transparent.""

However, if the claim is based on general public perception or specific improvements in the process compared to previous years, it could be considered true.

"Explanation: The claim that ""100% of electric generation comes from coal"" in the 18th Congressional District is false.

The district does not rely solely on coal for its electric generation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama is the first president to think he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore is false. While it is true that presidents have the power to enforce or not enforce certain laws, this is not a new concept. Presidents have always had this discretion, and it is a part of the executive branch's role in the U.S. government. The claim is an oversimplification and a misrepresentation of the president's role and the U.S. legal system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Charlie Crist ""worked with Acorn"" to give felons voting rights is false. Acorn (Community Organizing and Research Center) is a progressive community organizing group that was active in the 2000s, but it disbanded in 2010. Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor and U.S. Senator, has never been associated with Acorn or any of its activities. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true in many contexts, but not universally true.)"
"Explanation: The claim that Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close is a simplification of a complex political issue. While it is true that Republicans have been reluctant to close certain tax loopholes, especially those that benefit businesses and high-income individuals, it is not accurate to say they refuse to list any tax loophole they are willing to close. There have been instances where Republicans have proposed closing specific loopholes, such as the carried interest loophole, as part of broader tax reform discussions. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the Federal Reserve, as of the first quarter of 2021, the total amount of student loan debt in the United States was approximately $1.7 trillion. This is indeed more than the total credit card debt, which was around $800 billion in the same period.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Marco Rubio has publicly stated that he supports restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences, including those who have served time for non-violent offenses. He has also expressed support for certain gun control measures, but his stance on felons owning guns after serving their time is not as clear-cut as the claim suggests. The claim misrepresents his position on both issues.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. To calculate the time it would take to pay out $1 trillion at a rate of $1 per second, we need to convert $1 trillion to seconds. $1 trillion is equal to 1,000,000,000,000 dollars. At a rate of $1 per second, it would take 1,000,000,000,000 seconds to pay out $1 trillion. To convert seconds to years, we divide by the number of seconds in a year (365.25 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute). This calculation yields approximately 31,709 years, not more than 31,000 years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Chevrolet Volt is an electric vehicle (EV) with a gasoline engine for extended range. The vehicle's design and safety features are optimized for the unique characteristics of an EV, which includes the placement of the battery pack and other components. Installing a gun rack in a Volt could potentially interfere with the vehicle's electrical systems, battery pack, or other critical components, and may not be safe or recommended by the manufacturer. Therefore, it is not advisable to put a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States imposes a penalty on individuals who do not have health insurance and do not qualify for an exemption. This penalty is calculated as a percentage of the individual's income or a flat dollar amount, whichever is higher. The penalty is not lower than the cost of buying insurance; in fact, it is designed to encourage people to purchase health insurance. The penalty is intended to be a disincentive to avoid the cost of health insurance, not to be lower than the cost of insurance itself.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the government is spending 40 percent more than what it takes in is a simplification of the government's fiscal situation. The U.S. government's spending and revenue are influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, policy decisions, and tax revenues. While it's true that the government's spending can exceed its revenue in certain periods, the claim of a 40 percent overspending is not accurate and is an oversimplification. The actual figures would need to be examined in detail to provide a precise assessment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the biggest contribution behind a decrease in U.S. unemployment was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce is false. The decrease in unemployment is primarily attributed to the economic recovery and job growth, not to people leaving the workforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate decreased due to an increase in the number of people employed, not a decrease in the labor force participation rate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdoses are indeed a significant cause of death in the United States, including New Hampshire. However, the claim that drug overdoses are the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire is not accurate. The most common causes of death in New Hampshire are heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries, with drug overdoses being a significant but not the second-most common cause.

"Explanation: David Cicilline served as the Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island from 2006 to 2010. During his tenure, he did not explicitly declare Providence a sanctuary city. While he did advocate for policies that were more welcoming to immigrants, such as providing city services to undocumented immigrants, he did not officially designate the city as a sanctuary city. Therefore, the claim that Congressman Cicilline espoused a sanctuary city while he was the mayor of Providence is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 70 percent of Virginia's Medicaid costs are for seniors in nursing homes is not accurate. According to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, in 2020, about 40% of Medicaid spending in Virginia was for long-term care services, which includes nursing home care. However, this does not mean that 70% of Medicaid costs are specifically for seniors in nursing homes. The claim is an exaggeration and is therefore false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered by a referendum to levy a 1-cent sales tax. This claim is false because the sales tax is intended to cover a significant portion of Atlanta's transportation needs. The 1-cent sales tax is expected to generate approximately $1 billion annually, which is a substantial contribution to the city's transportation infrastructure. Therefore, the claim that it covers less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former U.S. President Barack Obama described Iran as a ""tiny"" country and said it doesn't pose a serious threat is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney believes the Arizona SB 1070 immigration law should be the model for national immigration laws is false. During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney did not endorse SB 1070 as a model for national immigration laws. Instead, he criticized the law and stated that it was not the right approach. He proposed a more comprehensive immigration reform plan that included border security, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and other measures.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that attorney general candidate Jon Richards stated he would only enforce laws with which he personally agreed. This is a significant and unusual stance for a candidate for attorney general, as the role typically involves enforcing all laws, regardless of personal agreement. Such a statement would be highly unusual and likely not accurate based on standard expectations for the role. There is no credible source provided to support this claim, and it is not a typical position for a candidate to take.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The pass rate for a high school level test to join the military can vary depending on the specific test and the military branch. However, the claim that the pass rate is 35 to 40 percent is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic that is often cited in discussions about poverty in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, approximately 37.2 million people in the United States were living in poverty. Among these, about 12.5 million were children. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data shows that Wisconsin has experienced job growth under both Democratic and Republican administrations. According to BLS data, Wisconsin's employment increased by 11.5% from 2011 to 2021, with significant job growth occurring during the Democratic administration of Governor Tony Evers. Therefore, the claim that job creation has been fewer under Republican control is not supported by the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the number of violent crimes in the United States has been decreasing since 2014. In 2020, the FBI reported a 2.5% decrease in violent crimes compared to the previous year. This trend is consistent with data from other sources, such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which also shows a decline in violent crime rates over the past decade.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: According to the World Bank, Israel's per capita income (GDP per capita) is indeed one of the highest in the world. As of 2021, Israel's per capita income was approximately $40,000, which is higher than many countries. However, it is not accurate to say that Israel's per capita income is greater than three-fourths of the rest of the world. The World Bank's data shows that Israel's per capita income is higher than many countries, but not all. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"

The relationship between them was publicly known and discussed during Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: President Barack Obama did indeed promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill during his first year in office. However, the bill was not passed during his first year. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2009 was introduced in the Senate in May 2009, but it did not pass. Therefore, the claim that Obama broke his promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill in his first year is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle class and small businesses"" is misleading. In 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which included several tax provisions, but it is not accurate to say that 25 tax cuts were passed. Additionally, the claim does not specify which tax cuts were aimed at the middle class and small businesses, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of that part of the statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Iran Nuclear Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The deal does not specify that Iran would be on the side of any country, including Israel, in the event of an attack. The JCPOA is a non-proliferation agreement and does not involve military alliances or commitments.

"Explanation: The claim that the national debt is as low as it has been since World War II is false.

The debt has been growing due to factors such as increased government spending and lower tax revenues.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Newport Tent company requires a different set of permits for each city or town they work in. This claim is likely false because most businesses, including those that set up tents, typically need similar types of permits (such as a business license, zoning permits, and health department approval) regardless of the location. The specific requirements might vary slightly, but the general process is usually consistent across different jurisdictions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Debbie Jackow will not de-fund the 20/20 land program. However, without specific information about Debbie Jackow's stance on this issue, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim.

"Explanation: The claim states that property taxes are now 18% higher than when Mark Sharpe first took office. To verify this claim, we would need specific data on property tax rates at the time Mark Sharpe took office and the current property tax rates.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false because it lacks specific data to support the 18% increase in property taxes.)"

"Explanation: The claim is based on a general perception rather than specific data. While there are polls and surveys that suggest a majority of Americans support background checks for gun sales, the exact figure of ""ninety percent"" is not supported by any reliable source.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a bill halting the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases would help stop rising gas prices is false. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates greenhouse gases primarily to address climate change, not to directly control gas prices. Gas prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and domestic production and consumption. Halting the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations would not directly address these factors and thus would not help stop rising gas prices.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the measles vaccine has killed 108 people in the last decade while no one has died of measles is false. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the measles vaccine has a very low risk of serious adverse reactions, and the vast majority of deaths from measles are due to the disease itself, not the vaccine. The claim also misrepresents the actual number of measles-related deaths, which are significantly higher than the number of vaccine-related deaths.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Virginia Department of Transportation, the state has indeed had a surplus in its transportation funds, but the amount and the spending on roads are not as stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the national debt added up to $75 trillion in 2010 and is on track to hit $99 trillion this year is false. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt is approximately $28 trillion, not $75 trillion. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the debt's growth over time. The debt has indeed increased significantly, but the figures provided are incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the majority of the Hispanic population and the growth of the population is U.S.-born is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2019, about 62% of the Hispanic population in the U.S. was foreign-born. While the Hispanic population is growing, the majority of this growth is due to immigration from other countries, not births within the U.S. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""No Bridge to Nowhere could occur"" is false. The term ""Bridge to Nowhere"" is a political term used to describe a project that is not needed or is wasteful. It is often used to criticize government spending on projects that do not provide any benefit. Therefore, it is possible for a ""Bridge to Nowhere"" to occur, as it is a real phenomenon in political and economic discourse.

"Explanation: The claim states that Joe Kyrillos voted against women's healthcare six times. To verify this, I would need to check the voting records of Joe Kyrillos on bills related to women's healthcare.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

"Explanation: The claim that food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama is false. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is the program commonly referred to as food stamps, did increase under Obama, but the increase was not two-and-a-half times. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average monthly benefit per person increased from $125.30 in 2008 to $135.00 in 2016, which is an increase of about 8%. This is not a two-and-a-half times increase.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: President Barack Obama did not make a specific promise to keep a Wisconsin GM plant from closing. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of his administration's efforts to save the auto industry during the 2008 financial crisis. The Obama administration provided loans to GM and Chrysler to help them restructure and avoid bankruptcy, but the specific plant closures were decisions made by the companies themselves, not a result of a broken promise by the president.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that most or all of global warming is due to natural causes is not supported by the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has concluded that it is extremely likely (95% confidence) that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. Natural factors, such as volcanic activity and solar radiation, contribute to climate variability, but they are not sufficient to explain the observed warming trend. Therefore, the claim that the science is in dispute is misleading, as the scientific consensus is clear and well-documented.

"Explanation: The claim that State Department officials directed contracts for the Haitian recovery after the earthquake to friends of the Clintons is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. The U.S. government's response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake was led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other federal agencies, not the State Department. Additionally, there is no evidence that any contracts were awarded to friends of the Clintons.

Illinois state parks do allow alcohol consumption, but there are certain restrictions and regulations in place.

Additionally, individuals must be of legal drinking age and must follow all park rules and regulations.

"Explanation: The claim that Tommy Thompson ran Medicare into the ground and brought it nine years closer to bankruptcy is a misrepresentation of his tenure as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. Medicare's financial status is influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in healthcare costs, demographic shifts, and policy decisions. While Thompson's tenure saw some changes in Medicare policy, there is no evidence to support the claim that he directly caused Medicare to be nine years closer to bankruptcy. The claim is misleading and not supported by factual evidence.

"Explanation: The claim that the Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia is false. The Georgia Dome was a sports and entertainment venue in Atlanta, Georgia, which was demolished in 2016. The economic impact of the Georgia Dome was primarily related to its use as a venue for events such as the Super Bowl, the NCAA Final Four, and other major events. However, the claim of a $10 billion economic impact is not supported by credible sources or studies. The actual economic impact of the Georgia Dome was likely much lower.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a common misconception about progressive taxation. In reality, Warren Buffett and other wealthy individuals typically pay a lower effective tax rate than their secretary due to the progressive nature of the tax system. This means that higher-income individuals pay a higher marginal tax rate, but they also benefit from various deductions, credits, and other tax advantages that lower their overall tax burden. The claim suggests that this is unfair, but it is a fundamental aspect of how the tax system is designed to redistribute wealth.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was a United States military policy that prohibited open discussion of sexual orientation in the military. This policy was officially ended in 2011 by the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama. However, the claim does not specify which Western countries have ended their ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policies, and it is not accurate to assume that all Western countries have done so. Therefore, the claim is not specific enough to be considered true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal debt has been increasing, but the relationship between debt and economic growth is complex and cannot be simplified to a direct ratio. The claim suggests a specific ratio ($2.52 borrowed for every $1 of economic growth), which is not accurate. Economic growth and debt are influenced by various factors, including fiscal policy, economic conditions, and monetary policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Keystone XL Pipeline is a proposed oil pipeline that would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States. The term ""earmark"" typically refers to a provision in a bill that directs funds to a specific project or purpose. However, the Keystone XL Pipeline is not an earmark under House rules. The pipeline's approval process involves environmental impact assessments and regulatory reviews, rather than being funded through an earmark.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they are paying now is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""a lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they're gay"" is a misconception. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that prison environments cause individuals to change their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is a complex trait influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and personal experiences, but it is not determined by prison environments. The claim is likely a myth or misinterpretation of the experiences of some individuals who may have come out as LGBTQ+ while in prison, but this does not mean that prison causes this change.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Darryl Glenn, a U.S. Senate candidate from Colorado, has not proposed eliminating the Department of Education or jeopardizing college funding for 320,000 Coloradans. Glenn has stated that he wants to reduce federal control over education and increase local control, but he has not proposed eliminating the Department of Education or putting 320,000 Coloradans' college funding at risk.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the president of the United States will be taking a trip to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day is highly unlikely to be true. Presidential trips abroad are typically planned and budgeted for by the Secret Service and other government agencies, and the costs are usually much lower than the figure stated in the claim. Additionally, the claim does not provide any credible source or context to support the $200 million per day figure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that white people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex issue of wealth distribution. While it is true that certain groups may have disproportionate wealth, the claim of 90 percent is an exaggeration. According to various studies and reports, the wealth distribution varies significantly by country and region. For instance, in the United States, the top 10 percent of wealth holders control about 70 percent of the wealth, but this is not exclusive to white people. The claim also does not account for the diversity within the white population, including those who are not wealthy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 200 consumer laws were destroyed in 2011 when Gov. Scott Walker signed Act 92 is false. Act 92, also known as the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, was a controversial piece of legislation that primarily dealt with collective bargaining rights for public employees. It did not significantly impact consumer laws. The claim of 200 consumer laws being destroyed is a misrepresentation of the actual effects of the legislation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Oregon ranked 25th or 7th from the bottom in percentage of children with untreated decay compared to 32 other states with similar data in 2007. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Oregon Health Authority, or other reputable health organizations that provide data on oral health in children. Without specific data or a reliable source to back up the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ted Kennedy sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact is false.

The embargo, also known as the blockade, is a set of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on Cuba, restricting trade and investment between the two countries.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, did not reject legislation to make college loan payments tax deductible. In fact, he signed a bill into law in 2015 that allowed for tax deductions on student loan interest.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) did conduct a survey in 2014, but the results regarding Right-To-Work legislation were not as stated. The survey found that 51% of business executives were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation, not 15%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""almost all"" protesters in Madison are from outside of Wisconsin is an overgeneralization and lacks specific evidence to support it. While it is true that some protesters may be from outside Wisconsin, it is not accurate to say that ""almost all"" are. The composition of protesters can vary greatly depending on the specific event and the location within Wisconsin. Therefore, the claim is not supported by reliable evidence.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The debt ceiling deal in 2011, known as the Budget Control Act, did not only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade. The deal included a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases, but it did not specifically allocate funds to extend the tax cuts. The tax cuts were extended as part of a separate agreement in 2012.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). According to the NCES, in the 2018-2019 school year, rural schools enrolled about 20% of American children, not 40%. However, they did receive about 22% of federal education funding. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, established the direct election of U.S. senators by popular vote. It replaced the previous system where senators were elected by state legislatures. Therefore, the claim that ""On repealing the 17th Amendment"" is false because the 17th Amendment has already been ratified and is part of the U.S. Constitution.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The actual number of jobs created during Bill Clinton's two terms (1993-2001) was approximately 22.5 million, while during George W.

"Explanation: A government shutdown can indeed disrupt veterans benefits.

This can lead to delays or disruptions in benefits such as disability compensation, pension payments, and healthcare services. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides subsidies for health insurance based on income and family size. However, the subsidy phase-out begins at a certain income level, which is $88,000 for a family of four in 2021. This means that a family of four earning $88,000 or less would qualify for a subsidy, but those earning more would not. Therefore, the claim that a family of four can make up to $88,000 a year and still get a subsidy is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that state workers have not had across-the-board raises in six years is not verifiable without specific data or sources.

It is possible that some state workers may have received raises, while others may not, depending on various factors such as their position, department, and specific policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that students in college used to take a popcorn popper and fry squirrel is highly unlikely. Popcorn poppers are not designed for frying squirrels, and it is not a common practice to cook squirrels in such a manner. Additionally, squirrels are not typically considered a food source in many cultures, and their preparation would require specific knowledge and tools that are not typically associated with a popcorn popper.

"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has stated that supporting the right to health care means you believe in slavery is a misrepresentation of his actual views. Sen.

The claim is a distortion of his position and is intended to mislead or misrepresent his views.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums for pre-existing conditions, including pregnancy.

The ACA also requires that maternity coverage be included in all health plans sold to individuals and small businesses.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the cost of commuting to New York City via the Port Authority with the income tax paid to the state of New Jersey. The cost of commuting can vary greatly depending on the specific route, time of day, and frequency of travel. Additionally, income tax rates and deductions can also vary significantly. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that commuting costs are always higher than income tax paid. The claim is not supported by specific data or a general rule that applies to all individuals earning under $100,000 a year.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there are 850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry is not accurate.

This discrepancy suggests that the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018. During his tenure, the Republican Party did not gain control of either the New Jersey Senate or the New Jersey General Assembly. However, the claim that he is the only governor since World War II to fail in this regard is incorrect. For example, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, a Democrat, also failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body during his term.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Sixty-percent of the state retirees...dont get Social Security"" is false. According to the Social Security Administration, all retirees who have earned enough credits (40 quarters) are eligible for Social Security benefits. The claim suggests that a significant portion of state retirees are not eligible, which contradicts the established rules and requirements for Social Security benefits.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that crime is down across the board and specifically mentions a 10 percent decrease in the most serious crimes. This claim is based on a general statement about crime rates and a specific percentage decrease. To verify this claim, one would need to look at official crime statistics from a reliable source such as the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program or similar data from other law enforcement agencies. Without specific data or a citation of the source, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Tampa mayoral opponent Bob Buckhorn supported forcing police officers to keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool under the new health care law is a misinterpretation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, also known as Obamacare, was designed to expand access to health insurance, not to force people into a government-run system. The law provides subsidies to help people afford private health insurance plans, and it also expanded Medicaid eligibility. The claim is false because it mischaracterizes the ACA's provisions and intent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Police departments do not typically run advertisements that directly target drug dealers or offer to ""take their competition off the streets for FREE.""

"Explanation: The claim is false. State laws regarding property appraisal and payment can vary, but generally, the appraisal process is used to determine the market value of the property, and the payment amount can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, negotiations, and the specific terms of the sale or transaction. The claim that the state can only pay a certain amount above the appraisal is not accurate as it oversimplifies the process and ignores the flexibility in property transactions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the cost of renting a U-Haul to move from San Francisco to Austin is twice as much as the cost to move from Austin to San Francisco due to a lack of trucks to flee the Golden State. This claim is false because the cost of renting a truck for a move is typically determined by factors such as distance, time of year, and demand, not by the direction of the move. The cost of renting a truck from San Francisco to Austin would be the same as from Austin to San Francisco, assuming the same truck size and rental period.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not doubled its estimate for the cost of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The CBO's initial estimate for the cost of the ACA was $1.1 trillion over 10 years, not $800 billion. The CBO has revised its estimates over time, but the most recent estimates are still in the range of $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion over 10 years, not $1.7 trillion.

The study also noted that these renewable energy sources could be cost-competitive with conventional energy sources by that time.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly provide for just compensation when land is taken under eminent domain. Instead, the Fifth Amendment states that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. This means that the government must provide fair compensation to the owner when it takes their property for a public purpose. However, the specific amount of compensation is determined by the courts and can vary based on the circumstances.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the spending on negative ads by Mitt Romney's campaign to the spending by John McCain's campaign during his entire presidential run. As of the time of this analysis, there is no publicly available data that directly supports this claim. Campaign spending data is typically reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and is not always immediately available. Therefore, without specific data from reliable sources, it is not possible to verify the claim.

"Explanation: The claim that for every $10,000 invested in business incubators, up to nearly 70 local jobs are generated, is not supported by reliable data or studies. While business incubators can indeed create jobs, the number of jobs created can vary greatly depending on various factors such as the industry, the specific incubator program, and the local economic conditions. There is no universally accepted figure that states for every $10,000 invested, nearly 70 jobs are generated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true but misleading. While it is accurate that Presidents Harding, Kennedy, and Reagan cut taxes during recessions, the claim that they all produced ""rapid and dramatic economic recoveries"" is an oversimplification. The economic recoveries under these presidents varied in speed and magnitude. Additionally, the claim that Herbert Hoover and Barack Obama did ""the opposite"" is also misleading. Hoover did not cut taxes during the Great Depression, but his policies were not the primary cause of the economic downturn. Obama's stimulus package included tax cuts, but the claim that he did ""the opposite"" of the other presidents is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, which found that the income of the top 1 percent in the United States nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, while the income of the typical family (median income) barely increased. This study has been widely cited and is considered reliable. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that financial conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the president and that the president does not have to have a blind trust is false. The U.S. Constitution and federal laws, such as the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, require the president to disclose their financial interests and may require them to place their assets in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest. This is to ensure that the president's decisions are not influenced by their personal financial interests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding decreased under President Bush is not accurate. In fact, NIH funding increased significantly during his presidency. From 2001 to 2008, the NIH budget increased from $14.9 billion to $28.6 billion, an increase of 85%. This increase was part of a broader trend of increased funding for medical research during the Bush administration.

"Explanation: The claim that the radiation from new TSA body scanners is equivalent to about three minutes worth of air travel at 30,000 feet is misleading. While it is true that the radiation dose from the TSA body scanners is low, comparing it to air travel at 30,000 feet is not accurate. The radiation dose from air travel at high altitudes is primarily due to cosmic radiation, which is different from the type of radiation used in TSA body scanners. The TSA body scanners use non-ionizing radiation, specifically millimeter waves, which are not the same as the ionizing radiation encountered at high altitudes. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she is raped is a misinterpretation of the concept of ""rape shield laws"" and the body's natural responses to trauma. While it is true that the body can experience physical and psychological responses to trauma, including stress and shock, there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that the body can actively prevent pregnancy in response to rape. The claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the new healthcare law crushes small businesses with billions in penalties is a simplification and an exaggeration. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does impose penalties on businesses that do not provide health insurance to their full-time employees, but these penalties are not applied to all small businesses. The penalties are only applied to businesses with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, the penalties are not billions but are calculated based on the number of full-time employees and the cost of providing health insurance. Furthermore, the ACA also provides tax credits to small businesses to help offset the cost of providing health insurance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that despite having a president who was opposed to abortion, the number of abortions did not decrease.

The claim is supported by data showing that the number of abortions remained relatively stable during his presidency.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""every school will be negatively impacted if Education Stability Fund is not tapped"" is a generalization that may not hold true for all schools. The impact of not tapping the Education Stability Fund would depend on various factors, including the specific needs and financial situations of individual schools. Some schools might have other funding sources or reserves that could mitigate the impact, while others might be more severely affected. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every school will be negatively impacted.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that the United States sends a billion dollars to foreign countries every day due to its addiction to foreign oil is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate. While the U.S. does import a significant amount of oil, the total cost of these imports is not a billion dollars per day.

Additionally, the U.S. is also a major oil producer and exporter, which helps to balance the trade.

Numerous studies and reports have shown that individuals from lower-income backgrounds are more likely to engage in substance abuse, including drugs.

"Explanation: The claim that the Democrats' health care bills would provide ""free health care for illegal immigrants"" is false. While some Democratic proposals have included provisions to expand access to health care for undocumented immigrants, these bills do not provide ""free"" health care for all undocumented immigrants.

The term ""free"" is misleading as it implies no cost, which is not accurate.

While it is true that some people have experienced higher premiums and reduced coverage under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), this is not a universal experience. Many people have benefited from the law, including those who were previously uninsured, those who received subsidies to lower their premiums, and those who gained access to preventive care and essential health benefits.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While pharmacies do have databases to manage prescription drugs, these databases are not designed to track and manage all prescription drugs across the entire healthcare system. A separate prescription drug database would be beneficial for tracking drug usage, identifying potential drug interactions, and monitoring the effectiveness of treatments on a larger scale. The current pharmacy databases are more focused on inventory management and patient-specific records rather than providing a comprehensive overview of prescription drug usage across the entire population.

"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did not force people out of their health plans.

Therefore, while the ACA did not explicitly force people out of their health plans, it did create circumstances that led some people to change their coverage.

Additionally, the study's findings have been disputed by other researchers who argue that the data is misleading and that the percentage of criminal aliens is actually lower.

"Explanation: The claim that repealing Obamacare saves our nation more than $2 trillion is false. The $2 trillion figure is often cited in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare's overall cost, but it does not represent savings from repealing the law.

"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no constitutional amendment that bans drilling off Florida's coast. The U.S. Constitution does not have provisions that specifically address offshore drilling. Instead, the regulation of offshore drilling is governed by federal laws and regulations, such as the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The ban on drilling off Florida's coast is a result of executive orders and policies, not a constitutional amendment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, the words ""al-Qaida"" were indeed used. The claim that these words were never used in the address is incorrect. Additionally, the claim that this is the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001 is also false, as the words ""al-Qaida"" were used in previous State of the Union addresses.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: John McCain, a Republican Senator from Arizona, was known for his conservative views on economic issues. He did vote against several minimum-wage increase bills during his time in the Senate. However, the claim that he voted 19 times against a minimum-wage increase is not accurate. According to records, he voted against a minimum-wage increase bill in 2007, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he voted against it 19 times.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that only four Texas legislators voted against a law giving in-state tuition rates to certain illegal immigrants. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that only four legislators voted against the law. In fact, the law in question, SB 175, was passed with a majority vote, and the number of legislators who voted against it was more than four. The specific details of the vote can be verified through official legislative records.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Oregon is indeed highly dependent on trade, with a significant portion of its economy driven by exports. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Oregon's exports accounted for 19.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, which is one of the highest percentages among U.S. states. This makes Oregon one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misunderstanding of federal tax revenue and spending. New Jersey and Kentucky, like all states, receive federal funds for various programs, but this does not mean they are getting back more than they send. The federal government collects taxes from all states and uses these funds to provide services and benefits to all Americans. The claim that New Jersey gets 61 cents back for every dollar sent to Washington and Kentucky gets $1.51 back is incorrect and misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everyone's jobs, including low-income African-Americans, is false. Hillary Clinton has not proposed such a policy. She has, however, supported comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but this does not involve instant work permits for millions of new immigrants. Additionally, the claim that this would take jobs from low-income African-Americans is a common misconception and not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States spends $12,000 per child per year in the school system is not accurate. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average expenditure per student in the United States in 2019 was approximately $12,635. However, this figure includes all levels of education (elementary, secondary, and post-secondary) and is not specific to a single year. The claim also uses the term ""a kid,"" which is informal and not typically used in official or academic contexts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor"" is a statement that cannot be objectively verified without additional context. It could be a personal opinion or a statement made in a specific context. Without knowing the context or the speaker's identity, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's statements about Muslims are used to recruit fighters by terrorist groups is a complex issue. While it is true that some extremist groups may use political rhetoric to recruit, it is not accurate to attribute all recruitment efforts to specific statements made by a particular individual. The recruitment strategies of terrorist groups are multifaceted and often involve a combination of ideological, religious, and social factors. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that Trump's statements are directly used for recruitment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 U.S. presidential election. However, Christie was not the first governor to endorse Romney. Other governors, such as John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Perry of Texas, also endorsed Romney before Christie.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Bob Graham missing a significant percentage of their votes in 2004 and 2008 is false. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of voting records. In reality, these figures are often misrepresented or exaggerated. For instance, the claim that Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes in 2008 is incorrect. Similarly, the claims about Kerry and Graham are also inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Texans eat more catfish than residents of all other states combined is false. While Texas does have a significant catfish industry and is one of the top producers of catfish in the United States, it is not accurate to say that Texans consume more catfish than residents of all other states combined. Catfish consumption varies widely across the country, and it is not accurate to attribute the majority of catfish consumption to Texas alone.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other climate agencies have reported that 2014 was not the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded. In fact, 2015 and 2016 were both warmer than 2014 in terms of global temperature.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has indeed expanded health coverage to millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. However, the claim that it has ""saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans"" is not supported by specific data or studies. While the ACA has undoubtedly improved access to healthcare, the exact number of lives saved due to the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions is not quantified in a way that can be attributed to the ACA alone.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the New Jersey Department of Personnel, the number of state employees has been fluctuating over the years, but it has not decreased to the level it was when Christie Whitman left office in 2001. In fact, the number of state employees has generally increased since then.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Senate Republican education plan is an unfunded mandate for local school districts is based on the idea that the plan requires school districts to implement certain policies or programs without providing sufficient funding to cover the costs. However, the actual funding provisions of the plan would need to be examined to determine if it is indeed an unfunded mandate. Without specific details about the funding mechanisms and the extent to which the plan requires local districts to cover costs, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate, has indeed made statements about the economy. However, the specific claim that he has said the economy is ""not his strong suit"" is not a widely recognized or verified statement. There is no substantial evidence or widely reported quote from McCain that directly supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories"" is not accurate. While it is true that the United States has been experiencing a decline in manufacturing jobs and closures of factories, the number of factories closing daily is not consistently 15. This claim is an exaggeration and not supported by reliable data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that the current agriculture commissioner allowed tainted beef to be sent to school cafeterias. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Congressman John Lewis did not make allegations that Sarah Palin and Donald Trump were associated with the worst chapter in American history. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of Lewis' statements. Additionally, Senator Obama did not make any remarks about the association of Sarah Palin and Donald Trump with the worst chapter in American history.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The national debt is indeed a significant figure, but it is not accurate to say that it is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household. The national debt is approximately $28 trillion as of 2021, and the U.S. population is around 331 million. Dividing the debt by the population gives a figure of about $84,600 per person, not $48,700. Similarly, the U.S. has about 128 million households, so dividing the debt by the number of households gives a figure of about $218,000 per household, not $128,300. The claim also incorrectly states that the national debt is equivalent to the size of the entire economy. The U.S. economy is much larger than the national debt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the House of Representatives voted to remove the word ""lunatic"" from federal law is false. The term ""lunatic"" is not used in federal law and has not been a subject of recent legislative action. The term is outdated and has been replaced by more accurate and respectful terminology in mental health contexts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the state's budget shortfall is not that much different than it was in 2003 cannot be accurately evaluated without specific data or context. Budget shortfalls can vary significantly from year to year due to numerous factors such as economic conditions, tax revenues, and spending priorities. Without concrete figures or a comparison of the actual shortfalls for the respective years, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific time period (2011-13) and a specific group (school districts). To verify the claim, one would need to look at data from that specific time period and group. Without access to such data, it's impossible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, if the claim is based on a reliable source and the data supports it, then the claim could be considered true.

Answer: 0/1 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The ACA expanded healthcare coverage to millions of Americans, including many in Florida. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of 2021, about 11.4 million Americans in Florida were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) due to the ACA. However, the claim of ""thirty million Americans"" is an exaggeration. The actual number of Americans who gained coverage due to the ACA is around 20 million.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
"Explanation: The claim that there is only one candidate under investigation, Terry McAuliffe, is false. There have been multiple candidates under investigation in various political and legal contexts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have specific information about the current composition of the Austin City Council. However, it is possible to verify this information by checking the official Austin City Council website or other reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has not been focusing on the fact that 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of data related to traffic patterns or vehicle occupancy rates. TxDOT's focus is typically on infrastructure maintenance, traffic management, and safety, not on the specific occupancy rates of vehicles.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go when the restrictions of the Iran nuclear deal expire is false. The Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), includes strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure Iran's nuclear activities remain peaceful. Once the restrictions expire, Iran will still be subject to international inspections and monitoring to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. The claim overstates the immediate threat and ignores the ongoing oversight mechanisms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that sixty percent of auto thefts in St. Petersburg are caused by people leaving their keys in the car is not supported by reliable data or statistics. While it is true that leaving keys in the car can be a factor in thefts, it is unlikely that such a high percentage of thefts are attributed to this specific cause. The actual percentage of thefts due to keys left in the car would likely be much lower.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) is a measure of the proportion of the population that is either employed or actively seeking employment. The LFPR has been declining since the 1990s, and it was at 67.3% when Barack Obama became president in 2009. As of 2021, the LFPR is around 61.7%. If the LFPR were to remain at the 2009 level, the unemployment rate would not necessarily be 11%. The unemployment rate is influenced by various factors, including the size of the labor force, the number of job openings, and the number of people actively seeking work. Therefore, the claim that the unemployment rate would be 11% if the LFPR were the same as when Obama became president is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010 is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), there was indeed a significant increase in the number of 501(c)(4) applications in 2010. This surge was largely attributed to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the subsequent political activity surrounding it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Hurricane Katrina occurred in August 2005, and the U.S. Congress did pass a $60 billion relief package in September 2005. However, Superstorm Sandy occurred in October 2012, and the U.S. Congress did not pass a $60 billion relief package for Sandy. The claim is misleading by suggesting that no relief package was passed for Sandy, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama's budget did not propose an Army with fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Army's size has fluctuated over time, but it is not accurate to say that Obama's budget proposed a reduction to the level of personnel before Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Army's size has been influenced by various factors, including the needs of the military and the political climate, but it is not accurate to make the claim as stated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the extra point is almost automatic and provides a specific statistic: ""The NFL had five missed extra points this year out of 1,200 some odd attempts."" This claim is false because it misrepresents the frequency of missed extra points. The NFL has a high success rate for extra points, and five missed attempts out of 1,200 is a very low number, indicating that extra points are indeed quite automatic.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""under his tax plan, no matter where you are in the stratosphere, you're going to be getting a tax cut"" is a generalization that is not specific to any particular tax plan or individual. Tax plans can vary greatly depending on the specific provisions and the income levels they target. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say that everyone will receive a tax cut under any given tax plan without more specific information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Texas has indeed been waiting for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to create insurance opportunities for the uninsured. In 2020, Texas submitted a waiver request to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to allow the state to create a reinsurance program to help lower premiums for individuals and small businesses. This proposal was part of a broader effort to address the state's high uninsured rate. As of my last update in October 2023, the federal government has not yet approved this proposal.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that someone was endorsed by the Valley News newspaper cannot be verified without additional context or evidence.

Without specific details or a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that John McCain voted against funding the troops because of a timeline in it to draw down American troops is false. John McCain was a strong supporter of the military and was known for his hawkish stance on foreign policy. He voted against the 2008 Defense Authorization Act because he believed it did not provide enough funding for the troops and did not address the issue of the troop surge in Iraq. He did not vote against funding the troops due to a timeline to draw down American troops.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there was a ""massive landslide victory"" in the Electoral College is false. The Electoral College is a process where each state's electoral votes are allocated based on the popular vote in that state. A ""landslide victory"" typically refers to a significant margin of victory in the popular vote, not the Electoral College. In the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, Joe Biden won the popular vote by a significant margin, but the Electoral College vote was much closer, with Biden winning 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 232.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a new bill was written into the new healthcare reform initiative ensuring that Congress will be 100 percent exempt is false. There is no such bill or provision that has been publicly disclosed or confirmed by credible sources. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and subsequent healthcare reform initiatives do not provide Congress with 100 percent exemption from the healthcare system. In fact, members of Congress are required to participate in the same healthcare system as the general public.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that over 14,000 registered voters lost their vote in 2008 due to voting in the wrong precinct is false. While it is true that voting in the wrong precinct can result in a lost vote, the number of 14,000 is not accurate. The actual number of votes lost due to incorrect precinct voting in 2008 was much lower. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not based on accurate information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the form students fill out to get college financial aid is ""longer than the form to get U.S. citizenship"" is false. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is used to apply for college financial aid, is typically shorter and simpler than the U.S. citizenship application form, which is known as the N-400 form. The N-400 form is significantly longer and more complex due to the detailed requirements for naturalization.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is not verifiable with the information provided. It is a subjective statement that cannot be objectively proven or disproven without additional context or data. The claim does not specify the time period, the type of bills, or the definition of ""all the Democrats combined,"" making it impossible to accurately assess its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. As of the latest available data, Newt Gingrich has not raised as much money as Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee combined. According to the Federal Election Commission, as of the end of 2021, Newt Gingrich had raised $1.2 million, while the combined total for Romney, Pawlenty, Palin, and Huckabee was significantly higher.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a person has bipartisan support, including 53 sheriffs throughout the state, from both Democrats and Republicans. However, without specific evidence or sources to verify this claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy. Bipartisan support from 53 sheriffs is a significant claim and would typically be backed by concrete evidence such as endorsements, statements, or official records. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, the uninsured rate in Texas was 17.9%, which is indeed higher than the national average of 8.9%. However, the claim that ""one in four Texans lacks health insurance"" is an exaggeration. The correct figure is approximately 17.9%, not 25%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On repeal and replace of federal health care reform"" is incomplete and lacks specific details. It does not provide enough information to determine its truthfulness. The term ""repeal and replace"" is often used in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but without specifying what is being repealed and replaced, it is impossible to evaluate the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the real unemployment rate is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent is false. The official unemployment rate reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is 5.6% as of the latest data. The claim that the real unemployment rate is much higher is a common misconception, often based on misunderstandings of the official unemployment rate or the inclusion of discouraged workers and those who are underemployed. The BLS's official unemployment rate is calculated using a specific methodology that does not include all potential workers who are not in the labor force.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no bill passed by House Republicans that makes it legal for single mothers to be fired by their employers. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Florida's voting law does not require voter registrations to be turned in within 48 hours. The deadline for voter registration in Florida is typically 29 days before an election, not 48 hours. This misinformation is likely an attempt to spread confusion or disinformation about the voting process.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Vaccines are designed to prevent deadly and crippling diseases.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that China holds 26 percent of the U.S. debt is false. As of 2021, China holds approximately 10.9 percent of the U.S. debt, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's data. This percentage has been fluctuating over time, but it is not accurate to say that China holds 26 percent of the U.S. debt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Portland has higher standards than federal guidelines on police use of force is not accurate. Federal guidelines, such as those established by the Department of Justice, provide a framework for police use of force that is generally considered to be the standard across the United States. Portland, like other cities, must adhere to these federal guidelines. While local policies may have additional or more stringent requirements, they do not supersede federal standards.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a National Football League (NFL) lockout would cost Atlanta $160 million in lost jobs and revenue is not verifiable with the information provided. The impact of a lockout on a specific city's economy, including job losses and revenue, would depend on various factors such as the city's dependence on the NFL, the number of jobs directly and indirectly related to the NFL, and the economic conditions of the city. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rates for different racial and ethnic groups can vary. As of the latest data, the unemployment rate for Latinos (Hispanic or Latino) is typically higher than the unemployment rate for whites, and the unemployment rate for blacks is often higher than that for Latinos. Therefore, the claim that the Latino unemployment rate is higher than the white rate and the black rate is higher than the Latino rate is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama has spent over $2 million in legal fees defending lawsuits about his birth certificate is false. The lawsuits challenging Obama's birth certificate were largely dismissed or withdrawn, and the costs associated with these lawsuits were minimal. The claim is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""there's no rationing in any of these bills"" is false. Rationing is a common feature in many bills, especially those related to food, fuel, or other essential resources. The term ""rationing"" refers to the controlled distribution of goods or services to ensure fairness and prevent hoarding. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no bill backed by Sean Duffy or other House Republicans that requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to conduct audits of rape victims who get an abortion. The claim is a misinterpretation of a bill that would require the IRS to audit tax returns of individuals who receive abortion services, but it does not specifically target rape victims. The bill is not related to the IRS auditing rape victims.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor is a simplification of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While the ACA does introduce certain regulations and requirements for health insurance providers, it does not directly place the federal government between patients and their doctors. Instead, it aims to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health insurance and that insurance companies cannot deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The claim is misleading and oversimplifies the complex nature of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. The ACA has been widely studied and its impact on employment has been a subject of debate. Some studies suggest that the ACA may have led to a reduction in full-time employment, particularly among low-wage workers, due to the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees. However, these effects are not universally agreed upon and are often debated. The claim that the ACA will be the ""biggest job-killer ever"" is an exaggeration and not supported by the majority of evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the cost to implement Florida's class size amendment has been ""$16 billion"" is false. The Florida class size amendment, which was passed in 2002, aimed to reduce class sizes in public schools. However, the total cost of implementing this amendment has been estimated to be around $1.5 billion, not $16 billion. This misinformation likely arises from confusion with the overall cost of education in Florida or other large-scale educational initiatives.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table of abandoning the dollar for a multinational currency is false. Timothy Geithner, who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from 2009 to 2013, never publicly proposed or discussed the idea of abandoning the U.S. dollar for a multinational currency. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his views on international monetary policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Martin Heinrich spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas is false. The CARES Act, which was passed in March 2020, included a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to help businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds were allocated to various programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, and direct payments to individuals. The claim that the funds were spent on failed companies and jobs overseas is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that FCAT (Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test) tests account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year is false. FCAT tests are a significant part of the instructional time in Florida schools, as they are used to assess students' performance in various subjects and are a requirement for graduation. The actual percentage of instructional time dedicated to FCAT tests is not less than 1 percent but is a significant portion of the school year.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning is false. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, included a provision that required indoor tanning services to be treated as a medical service, which led to an increase in the cost of tanning services. However, this was not a 10 percent tax on tanning but rather a requirement for tanning services to be treated as a medical service, which increased the cost of these services.

"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not own 60 percent of GM, nor did his union buddies own almost 20 percent. The U.S. government, through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), owned approximately 61% of GM's shares at its peak, but this was a temporary investment to stabilize the company during the financial crisis. The government sold its shares in GM in 2013, and the union's ownership was not a significant part of the GM's equity structure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that there are 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts since lawmakers acted. However, there is no specific law or action mentioned that would directly lead to the creation of these businesses. Additionally, there is no credible source provided to verify this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that gas prices have doubled because of Obama's policies is misleading and inaccurate. Gas prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and market speculation. The claim that Obama's policies directly caused gas prices to double is not supported by evidence. Additionally, the claim that Obama gave millions of tax dollars to Solyndra and blocked the Keystone pipeline is true, but these actions do not directly correlate to the doubling of gas prices. The Keystone pipeline was blocked due to environmental concerns, and Solyndra's bankruptcy was a result of market conditions and not a direct consequence of Obama's policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, California's credit rating is not the worst in the country. California has a credit rating of AA- from Moody's, which is considered investment-grade. The state with the lowest credit rating in the U.S. is Illinois, which has a rating of BBB- from Moody's. Therefore, the claim that California has the worst credit rating in the country is false.

"Explanation: Lee Leffingwell served as the Mayor of Austin, Texas from 2009 to 2019, a total of 10 years. Sarah Palin served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009, a total of 3 years. Therefore, the claim that Lee Leffingwell has been mayor of Austin, Texas for about as long as Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The unemployment rates in Ferguson, Missouri, are not directly attributable to President Barack Obama's policies. The unemployment rates in Ferguson are influenced by a variety of factors, including local economic conditions, industry-specific issues, and broader economic trends. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that the black unemployment rate is three times higher than the white unemployment rate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) does not have the authority to prevent a company from building a factory in a state based on its labor laws. The NLRB's jurisdiction is limited to enforcing the National Labor Relations Act, which deals with labor relations and collective bargaining, not the specific labor laws of a state. South Carolina's right-to-work law does not prevent Boeing from building a factory there, as it is a matter of state law, not federal law.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of deaths from gun violence in the United States to the number of deaths in the Afghanistan conflict. According to the Gun Violence Archive, as of 2021, there were approximately 24,000 deaths from gun violence in the United States. In contrast, the number of U.S. military and contractor deaths in Afghanistan, as of 2021, was around 2,400.

The Trump Winery is a small, family-owned winery that produces a limited amount of wine. It is not the largest winery on the East Coast. The largest winery on the East Coast is the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Washington, which has a much larger production and more extensive vineyards.

"Explanation: The claim that the national debt is on track to exceed the size of the entire economy in just two more years is an exaggeration. While the national debt is indeed growing, it is not expected to exceed the size of the economy in such a short period. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the national debt is projected to reach 102% of GDP by 2023, but this is not expected to happen in just two years. The claim is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Powell Butte water reservoir was not necessary and that the money spent on its construction could have been saved.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to the concept of ""underemployment"" or ""hidden unemployment,"" which includes people who are struggling to find work, have stopped looking, or are working part-time but want full-time work. The official unemployment rate, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, is based on a specific methodology that does not include these groups. The BLS defines unemployment as ""the number of people who are jobless, actively seeking work, and available to take a job."" Therefore, the claim that the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent when considering all people struggling for work or have just stopped looking is not accurate based on the official definition and methodology.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a congressional laundry closed due to the partial government shutdown is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that under City Council Member Randi Shade, Austin had the highest city debt per person in Texas is not verifiable with the information provided.

Without specific data and context, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration's projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional information.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Amendment 4 in Florida, which was passed in 2018, does not have a local version that would specifically apply to St. Pete Beach. The amendment is a state-wide law that allows for the restoration of voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences and paid all fines and fees. There is no evidence to suggest that St. Pete Beach taxpayers have had to pay hundreds of thousands in legal bills due to a local version of Amendment 4.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders have entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Capitol rotunda was designed by Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Henry Latrobe in the early 19th century. Its primary purpose was to serve as a grand entrance and a central gathering space for the U.S. Congress. While it has been used for various events, including protests, its original design was not intended to specifically accommodate protests. The claim that the rotunda was made to invite the people in and to accommodate protests is a misinterpretation of its historical context.

"Explanation: The claim that over 214,000 doctors have opted out of Obamacare exchanges is false. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as of 2021, there were approximately 100,000 physicians participating in the exchanges. The number of physicians participating in the exchanges has been declining, but the claim of over 214,000 doctors opting out is an exaggeration.

For example, France has a corporate tax rate of 25%, and Germany has a rate of 29.9%. Therefore, the U.S. does not have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""a legacy of taxing and borrowing crippled the economy we inherited two years ago"" is subjective and depends on the specific context and definitions of ""crippled"" and ""two years ago."" Without specific data or context, it's difficult to definitively judge the claim as true or false. However, if we consider the general economic conditions and fiscal policies of the past two years, it's possible to infer that excessive taxing and borrowing could have had negative impacts on the economy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be definitively judged as true without more specific context.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Charlie Crist, who served as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011, did not veto $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida. The claim is a misinterpretation of a budget cut that occurred during his tenure. Crist did not veto the entire budget request but rather made adjustments to the budget, which included cuts to various programs, including the teaching hospital.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama has gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing George W. Bush is false. While it is true that Barack Obama criticized George W. Bush during his presidency, there is no evidence to suggest that he has plagiarized any of George W. Bush's policies or statements. The claim seems to be a mischaracterization or a misinterpretation of political rhetoric.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump said ""all Mexicans are rapists"" is a misrepresentation of his actual statement. In a 2015 speech, Trump said, ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" This statement was widely criticized for its generalization and stereotyping. Therefore, the claim that he said ""all Mexicans are rapists"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama in 2008 is false. While unions did contribute significantly to Obama's campaign, the total amount was not $400 million. According to reports, unions contributed around $100 million to Obama's campaign in 2008. This figure is significantly lower than the claimed $400 million.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the 2007-09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion, which cost every man, woman, and child in the state an extra $310. To verify this claim, we need to check the accuracy of the tax hike amount and the per capita cost.

The claim does not provide a source or reference to support the $1.8 billion tax hike figure or the $310 per capita cost. Without a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of these numbers. Therefore, the claim cannot be independently verified as true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without a reliable source.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, lying about your age on a dating website is not considered a misdemeanor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the proposed raises for the Norcross City Council would put it in line with other similarly sized communities. To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the proposed raises with the compensation of city councils in other communities of similar size. If the proposed raises align with the average or median compensation of city councils in similar-sized communities, the claim is true. If not, the claim is false.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true if the proposed raises align with the compensation of city councils in other similarly sized communities.)"
"Explanation: The claim is true. While the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 was a significant nuclear incident, it did not result in any deaths. The accident led to the release of a small amount of radioactive iodine into the environment, but no one was killed as a result of the accident. The claim is accurate in stating that there have been no deaths caused by a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Obama spent ""40 percent of the PAC money, 43 percent to be exact, on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians"" is false. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of data. The actual spending by Obama's campaign on these states was not 40% or 43% of his PAC money. The claim is likely a result of a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, Texas ranks 41st out of 50 states in the percentage of residents with high school diplomas.

This trend is consistent with the long-term warming trend observed over the past century.

"Explanation: The claim that a North Carolina study proves that over a million people voted twice in the 2012 election is false. There is no credible evidence or study from North Carolina that supports this claim. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of a study that looked into voter fraud or irregularities, but not specifically the claim of over a million people voting twice.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Tarpon Springs takes its homeless to St. Petersburg is false. Tarpon Springs has its own homeless services and does not typically transport homeless individuals to St. Petersburg.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""illegal immigration is not actually getting worse"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While it's true that the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border has fluctuated over time, the overall trend has been an increase in illegal immigration attempts. For instance, the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border has been increasing since 2017, with a significant spike in 2021. Therefore, the claim that illegal immigration is not getting worse is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of events: apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border and births in Texas. While it is true that a significant number of people are apprehended at the border each week, the number of births in Texas is also substantial. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the state has an average of about 10,000 births per week. The number of apprehensions at the border can vary, but it is typically in the tens of thousands per week. Therefore, the claim that more people are apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border a week than are born in Texas each week is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there was a steady reduction in U.S. debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for more than 30 years after World War II is false. While it is true that the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio decreased in the 1950s and 1960s, it has been increasing since the 1970s and has been consistently above 100% since the 1980s. The debt-to-GDP ratio has fluctuated but has not shown a steady reduction over the long term.

"Explanation: The claim is false. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law in 1935, it was designed to provide benefits to a wide range of Americans, not just widows and orphans. It included provisions for old-age benefits, survivors' benefits, and disability benefits. Similarly, Medicare, which was established in 1965, was not a small program but a significant expansion of the Social Security system to provide health insurance for the elderly.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to the U.S. federal budget deficit, which is the difference between the government's spending and its revenue. In 2021, the U.S. federal budget deficit was indeed on track to top $1 trillion. This was due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's response to it, including the passage of the CARES Act and other stimulus packages. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has testified before Congress multiple times regarding the 2012 attack in Benghazi. She appeared before the House Select Committee on Benghazi in 2015 and 2016, and also testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2016. Therefore, the claim that she refuses to testify is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson appears to endorse world government is a misinterpretation of his statements. In a 2010 interview, Bryson discussed the need for international cooperation and the potential benefits of a global economy, but he did not explicitly endorse a world government.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rob Portman voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was released by Obama in 2009 is false. Al-Baghdadi was captured by U.S. forces in Iraq in 2004 and was held in Camp Bucca prison. He was released in 2009, but this was due to a lack of evidence to keep him in custody, not because of any action by President Obama. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has historically opposed expanded background checks for gun purchases. The NRA has argued that such checks would infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens and would not prevent gun violence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you have gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party is false. The claim is made by Donald Trump, who has indeed won the Republican primaries in 2016 and 2020. However, the claim that he has gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party is not accurate. The most votes in a Republican primary were received by Mitt Romney in 2012, who won the Republican nomination but lost the general election to Barack Obama.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that when the New Hampshire Legislature raised the gasoline tax, gas prices in the state were skyrocketing is not accurate. While it is true that the gasoline tax was raised, the claim that gas prices skyrocketed is an exaggeration. Gas prices in New Hampshire did increase, but the increase was not disproportionately higher than the increase in other states or the national average. The claim is misleading and does not accurately reflect the relationship between the tax increase and gas prices.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there has been bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives for the repeal of Obamacare, getting rid of cap and trade, and building the Keystone Pipeline is misleading. While there have been attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) with bipartisan support, the repeal efforts have not been successful. Additionally, there has been bipartisan support for the Keystone Pipeline, but the claim that there has been bipartisan support for getting rid of cap and trade is false. Cap and trade is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and it has bipartisan support in some forms, but the claim that there has been bipartisan support for getting rid of it is an oversimplification.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government has not announced a plan to spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year. The U.S. has been reducing its military presence and aid in Afghanistan, not increasing it. Additionally, the claim that the U.S. is cutting the same things in its own country is not supported by any official statements or plans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the wrong precinct rules exacerbate provisional ballot problems and that HB 194 does nothing to solve this issue. However, without specific information about the content of HB 194 and the exact nature of the wrong precinct rules, it is difficult to definitively judge the claim. If HB 194 is intended to address the wrong precinct problem but fails to do so, then the claim would be true. If HB 194 does address the issue, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower has been widely debunked. Multiple investigations and reports have found no evidence to support this claim.

"Explanation: Sharron Angle, a former U.S. Senator from Nevada, did propose to eliminate the Department of Education during her 2010 Senate campaign. She argued that education should be handled at the state and local levels, and that the federal government should have less involvement. However, this was a campaign promise and not a policy that was implemented during her time in office.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that BP's $20 billion fund to compensate oil spill victims is a ""slush fund"" is false. A slush fund is typically used to describe a fund that is used for discretionary or non-transparent purposes. However, BP's $20 billion fund was established as part of a legal settlement to compensate victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The fund was set up to provide compensation to individuals and businesses affected by the spill, and it was overseen by a court-appointed administrator. Therefore, the fund was not intended for discretionary use and was not a slush fund.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""on in-state tuition for illegal immigrants"" is generally false. In-state tuition is typically reserved for residents of a particular state, and many states have laws that prevent illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition rates. However, some states have policies that allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates, but this is not universal and varies by state. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""the five economic indicators that the federal government tracks - for the first time since August 2006 - were positive this October."" This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that all five economic indicators were positive for the first time since August 2006. Economic indicators such as GDP, employment, and inflation have shown positive trends in recent months, but it is not accurate to say that all five indicators were positive for the first time since August 2006.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing annual deficits under Republican administrations with monthly deficits under Democratic administrations. This is a misleading comparison because annual deficits are typically reported on an annual basis, while monthly deficits are reported on a monthly basis. The claim suggests that the annual deficits under Republicans have somehow become monthly deficits under Democrats, which is not a valid comparison. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a poll shows Democrats are just one point behind Gov. John Kasich without a name attached. However, the claim does not provide any specific details about the poll, such as the source, date, or methodology. Without this information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country is not accurate. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but it is not twice as much as other countries. For example, in 2019, the U.S. spent $10,966 per capita, while countries like Germany and Japan spent around $5,000 per capita. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, established the direct election of U.S. senators by popular vote. It replaced the previous system where senators were elected by state legislatures. Therefore, the claim that ""On repealing the 17th Amendment"" is false because the 17th Amendment has already been ratified and is part of the U.S. Constitution.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the property taxes decreased due to a reduction in the technical college portion of the taxes, which was attributed to state funding. However, without specific details or evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Property tax rates can be influenced by various factors, including local budgets, state funding, and other political decisions. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that minors find it easier to get marijuana than alcohol is not universally supported by studies. While some studies may suggest that minors can more easily access marijuana, others indicate that access to alcohol is also a significant issue. The ease of access to these substances can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, local laws, and enforcement. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that minors find it ""very easy"" to get marijuana compared to alcohol.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump is false. The Keystone XL pipeline was not a significant factor in determining gasoline prices. Gasoline prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global oil supply and demand, refinery capacity, and geopolitical events. The Keystone XL pipeline was one of many proposed projects, and its cancellation did not directly impact gasoline prices at the pump.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has indeed reduced the number of uninsured Americans, but the reduction is not 3 percent for $2 trillion. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the uninsured rate in the U.S. decreased from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2019. The cost of the ACA is estimated to be around $1.2 trillion over 10 years, not $2 trillion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we import more oil today than ever before is not accurate. While global oil consumption has been increasing, the peak of oil imports occurred in the 1970s due to the oil crisis. Since then, oil production and imports have fluctuated, but the overall trend has been a decrease in oil imports as a percentage of total oil consumption. This is due to increased domestic production and the development of alternative energy sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Will Hurd tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record is false. Will Hurd, a former Republican Congressman from Texas, was known for his moderate views and was often critical of his party's leadership. He voted with his party on most issues but was not as consistently conservative as the claim suggests. His voting record was more nuanced and varied, not strictly 96 percent Republican.

"Explanation: The claim that Greece is about the size of metropolitan Miami is incorrect. As of 2021, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Greece was approximately $243 billion, while the GDP of Miami-Dade County, which is the metropolitan area of Miami, was around $347 billion. Therefore, Greece is not comparable in size to Miami in terms of economic output.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children"" is a misinterpretation of the national debt. The national debt is the total amount of money the federal government has borrowed to finance its spending. It is not accurate to say that this debt is being borrowed from ""my children"" as it is a collective responsibility of the entire population. The debt is a result of the government's spending and is not directly borrowed from individuals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Cigarette butts are indeed a significant source of litter and can pose a risk to children and pets if ingested. However, the claim that they specifically poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them is misleading. While nicotine is a harmful substance, the primary danger from cigarette butts is the ingestion of the toxic chemicals and tar present in the butts, not the nicotine itself. Additionally, the amount of nicotine in a single cigarette butt is not sufficient to cause poisoning in a child.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, in a press release. The press release provides data from the Georgia Department of Labor, which shows that since Governor Kemp took office in January 2018, there have been 319,000 new private sector jobs created in Georgia, with nearly 93,000 of those coming in the past 12 months.

"Explanation: The claim that President Obama was proposing ""pinprick strikes"" for military intervention in Syria is false. The term ""pinprick strikes"" is not a recognized military strategy and was not used by President Obama or his administration.

"Explanation: The claim is about a change in a political figure's stance on a specific policy. Without specific context or a source, it's difficult to verify the exact nature of the change. However, if the claim is about a public figure's policy shift, it is generally true that politicians can change their positions over time. Therefore, the claim could be true depending on the specific context and the source of the information.

"Explanation: The claim is false. John Edwards, a former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate, was indeed a strong advocate for universal healthcare during his 2004 presidential campaign. He proposed a plan called ""Healthcare for All Americans,"" which aimed to provide universal healthcare coverage. Therefore, the statement that he wasn't for universal healthcare in 2004 is incorrect.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not released any specific data or reports indicating that its regulation of greenhouse gases will endanger 575 Texas dairy facilities, 58 swine operations, 1,300 corn farms, and 28,000 beef cattle operations. The EPA's regulations on greenhouse gases are aimed at reducing emissions from various sources, including power plants, vehicles, and industrial facilities, but the specific numbers provided in the claim are not supported by any official EPA data or reports.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) is a proposed law that would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment. It does not target or discriminate against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, or the rights of religious freedom. In fact, ENDA is designed to protect individuals from discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, which are protected classes under the law. The claim that ENDA discriminates against religious groups is a misinterpretation of the law's purpose and intent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: South Florida, particularly the Miami-Dade County area, is known for having a higher mosquito population compared to many other regions in the United States. This is due to the warm climate, abundant water sources, and the presence of invasive species like the Asian tiger mosquito. The Florida Department of Health and other local authorities often report higher mosquito activity in this region, which supports the claim.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that the City of Philadelphia and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, there is no evidence to support the claim that crime went down by 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual impact of the investment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island has one of the 10 strictest gun laws among all the states is not accurate. According to the Gun Violence Archive and other sources, Rhode Island has relatively moderate gun laws compared to other states. While it does have some strict regulations, such as a requirement for a permit to purchase a firearm and a ban on certain types of assault weapons, it does not rank among the top 10 states with the strictest gun laws.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 2011 was the worst drought year ever recorded in the region is not accurate. While 2011 was a severe drought year, it is not accurate to say it was the worst ever recorded. Droughts are often measured by their severity, duration, and impact, and there have been other years with more severe droughts in the region. For example, the drought of 1934, known as the Dust Bowl, was one of the most severe droughts in U.S. history and had a significant impact on the region.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""In the 1980s, the lowest income people had the biggest gains"" is false. During the 1980s, there was a significant increase in income inequality in the United States. While the overall economy grew, the gains were not evenly distributed. The top income earners saw substantial increases in their incomes, while the lowest income earners saw little to no increase. This period is often referred to as the ""Great Divergence"" due to the widening gap between the rich and the poor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that for every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps is a misinterpretation of data. The claim is based on a study by the Heritage Foundation, which suggested that for every job created by the stimulus package, 75 people were added to the food stamp rolls. However, this study was criticized for its methodology and the way it interpreted the data. The claim does not accurately reflect the relationship between job creation and food stamp usage during the Obama administration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that solar energy can be efficiently collected and transmitted over long distances. While it is true that the Southwestern desert has high solar radiation, the claim does not account for several factors:
1. **Efficiency of Solar Panels**: Solar panels are not 100% efficient. They typically convert around 15-20% of the sunlight they receive into electricity.
2. **Transmission Losses**: Transmitting electricity over long distances results in significant losses. The claim does not consider the infrastructure needed to transmit this energy efficiently.
3. **Storage and Distribution**: Solar energy is intermittent, requiring storage solutions like batteries. The claim does not address the need for storage and distribution infrastructure.
4. **Geographical Distribution**: The claim assumes that all the energy can be collected and used in one area, ignoring the need for a nationwide grid and distribution system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Bernie Sanders has been a consistent advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, including same-sex marriage, for many years. In 2000, he voted against a bill that would have allowed same-sex couples to marry in Vermont, but he has since changed his stance and has been a strong supporter of same-sex marriage. Therefore, the claim that he was there when it came to same-sex marriage 20 years ago is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as ObamaCare, does not require all persons enrolled in insurance plans to pay an abortion premium. The ACA prohibits federal funds from being used to pay for abortions, but it does not mandate that all insurance plans cover abortions. Additionally, the ACA allows states to opt out of covering abortions in their Medicaid programs. Therefore, the claim that the administration has issued rules for $1 abortions and requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay an abortion premium is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Rick Perry served as the Governor of Texas from 2007 to 2015. Before his political career, he worked as a businessman and ran a family business. Therefore, the claim that he has never held a private-sector job is false.

"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs state taxpayers over $3 billion every year is often cited in political debates but is not supported by comprehensive, widely accepted studies. The $3 billion figure is often derived from a 2017 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which has been criticized for its methodology and bias. Other studies and analyses have found that the economic impact of illegal immigration is more nuanced and often positive, with immigrants contributing to the economy through taxes and labor. Therefore, the claim is not supported by reliable, widely accepted evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a liberal immigration reform group endorsed Dave Brat, a GOP primary opponent.

"Explanation: The claim that welders make more money than philosophers is not universally true. The income of individuals in these professions can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, experience, education, and specific job roles. While welders in certain industries or regions may earn more than philosophers, the reverse can also be true in other contexts. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that welders always make more money than philosophers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Teddy Roosevelt did advocate for health care reform, but the claim that he ""first called for (health care) reform nearly a century ago"" is misleading. Roosevelt's advocacy for health care reform was in the early 20th century, but the term ""nearly a century ago"" suggests a much earlier time period. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

Therefore, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by John Brennan, the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), regarding the geographic limitations of drone strikes. However, the claim does not provide a specific source or context for Brennan's statement, making it difficult to verify its authenticity. Without a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm whether Brennan made this statement or not.

"Explanation: The claim states that 85% of recent college graduates are moving back in with their parents after four years of a celebrity president. However, there is no specific data or source provided to support this claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify which celebrity president is being referred to, making it difficult to attribute the trend to a specific individual. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and lacks sufficient evidence to be considered true.

"Explanation: The claim is true. The U.S. tax code has indeed seen numerous changes and additions since 1986, including new tax preferences and loopholes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, for instance, introduced several new provisions and changes to the tax code. Therefore, the statement that there have been ""literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986"" is accurate.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want to raise taxes on all income brackets is a generalization that is not accurate. While both have proposed tax increases on higher income brackets, they have not advocated for raising taxes on all income brackets. Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign platform included proposals to increase the top marginal tax rate and close loopholes for the wealthy, but she did not propose a tax increase for all income brackets. Similarly, Barack Obama's tax policies during his presidency focused on increasing taxes for the wealthy and closing loopholes, but he did not propose a tax increase for all income brackets. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss votes more with Democrats than with conservatives is false. Chambliss is a Republican and has consistently voted with the Republican Party. According to the Washington Post's ""Congressional Voting Score"" for the 116th Congress, Chambliss voted with Republicans 95% of the time and with Democrats 5% of the time. This indicates that he is a conservative and votes primarily with his party.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a specific political campaign's fundraising performance, which is typically a matter of public record. Campaign finance reports are usually filed with government agencies and are publicly accessible. Therefore, it is possible to verify the claim by checking the relevant campaign finance reports.

"Explanation: The claim that this is the first time since World War II that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together is false. There have been instances in the past where multiple nuclear-powered aircraft carriers have been docked together. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Harry S. Truman, were docked together in the Persian Gulf. Additionally, the U.S. Navy has conducted exercises with multiple carriers in the past, such as the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, where multiple carriers have been present.

Therefore, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not mandate that small businesses adopt a specific health care plan. Instead, it provides options for small businesses to offer health insurance to their employees. The penalty for not offering health insurance to employees is not a fine but a tax on the employer if they have 50 or more full-time equivalent employees and do not offer affordable health insurance. Additionally, the ACA does not apply to businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin has fallen to dead last in Midwest job growth is based on the latest job numbers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim refers to the Baucus bill, which is a reference to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) proposed by Senator Max Baucus.

The ACA includes provisions that prohibit federal funds from being used for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans"" is not accurate. While there are varying opinions on cap-and-trade policies, numerous polls and surveys have shown that a significant portion of Americans support or are neutral towards such policies. For instance, a 2021 poll by the Yale Climate Communications program found that 69% of Americans support a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the claim that cap-and-trade is ""wildly unpopular"" is an oversimplification and not supported by data.

Answer: 0"

Therefore, the claim is false as it stands because it lacks specific information to support the comparison.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that four-year terms for City Council members are the norm in most cities of our size is not accurate. The term length for City Council members varies widely across different cities and countries. While some cities do have four-year terms, many others have two-year terms, and some even have terms of three years or more. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that four-year terms are the norm.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Tommy Thompson is indeed known for his role in welfare reform, but he is not the father of the Wisconsin Works program. The program was created by Governor James E. Doyle in 1996, not by Tommy Thompson. Thompson served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2001 to 2003 and was a key figure in the implementation of welfare reform, but he did not create the Wisconsin Works program.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before"" is not accurate.

The claim is misleading because it does not provide context or specify the time period being compared.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the costs of cancer and all affiliated issues are over $20 billion a year to this state is not accurate. According to the American Cancer Society, the estimated cost of cancer care in the United States in 2020 was $174 billion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On a cap-and-trade plan"" is incomplete and lacks context. A cap-and-trade plan is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, where a limit (cap) is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted, and companies can trade emission allowances. Without additional information about the specific context or details of the claim, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""The left is blatantly attempting to disrupt Georgia's elections"" is a broad and vague statement that lacks specific evidence or context. Without concrete examples or sources, it is difficult to verify the truth of this claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011 is false. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2010, included provisions aimed at reducing prescription drug costs, such as the closing of the Medicare Part D doughnut hole, the specific claim about reducing costs for 3.6 million Americans in 2011 is not accurate. The ACA's provisions to reduce prescription drug costs were implemented over time and did not result in a specific number of Americans seeing reduced costs in 2011.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that AIG received a provision allowing it to dole out bonuses is false. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was established by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system during the 2008 financial crisis. AIG received $182 billion in bailout funds, but the government did not allow AIG to pay bonuses to its executives. In fact, the government initially prohibited AIG from paying bonuses to its executives, but later allowed it to pay bonuses to certain employees under strict conditions. The claim that AIG received a provision allowing it to dole out bonuses is a misinterpretation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that former U.S. President Barack Obama bombed 7 countries and former President George W. Bush bombed 4 countries. This claim is false.

This makes Virginia the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the position of the McCain campaign to that of Vice President Gore's campaign one week before the 2000 election. In 2000, the election was extremely close, with Gore leading in the polls but ultimately losing to George W. Bush. The McCain campaign, on the other hand, was not in a similar position. John McCain was not leading in the polls and was not in a close race with Barack Obama, who ultimately won the 2008 election. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Health care reform: Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care"" is a generalization and an oversimplification. Health care reform can have various impacts depending on the specific policies and measures implemented. Some reforms may indeed increase costs or taxes, but others aim to reduce costs, improve access, and enhance quality. The claim does not provide specific examples or evidence to support its assertions, making it difficult to judge its accuracy without more context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States has spent trillions of dollars since 1965 yet the poverty rate has not budged is misleading. While it is true that the United States has spent significant amounts on various social programs and initiatives aimed at reducing poverty, the poverty rate has indeed fluctuated over time. The poverty rate has decreased in some periods and increased in others, but it has not remained static. For instance, the poverty rate was around 15% in the 1960s, dropped to around 11% in the 1970s, and has fluctuated since then, reaching a low of 11.3% in 2000 and a high of 15.1% in 2010. Therefore, the claim that the poverty rate has not budged is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade is not accurate.

For instance, states like California, Florida, and Texas have also experienced a decline in higher education spending. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a million people come into the U.S. legally each year is not accurate. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the number of people who obtain lawful permanent resident status (green card) annually is around 1 million, but this includes both new immigrants and those who adjust their status. However, the number of new immigrants (those who are not already in the U.S. and obtain a green card) is significantly lower. The claim that no other country comes close to this figure is also misleading, as many countries have similar or higher numbers of legal immigrants.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush, a Republican, did not expand government health care. Instead, it created a new program called Medicare Part D, which provides prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. This program was not an expansion of government health care but rather a new addition to the existing Medicare program.

"Explanation: The claim that the Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country is not accurate. While the Koch brothers, through their companies, have been involved in various industries that contribute to pollution, such as fossil fuel extraction and manufacturing, they are not among the top polluters in the country. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists the top polluters by industry, and the Koch brothers' companies are not among the top emitters of greenhouse gases or other pollutants.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Texas is the only state that exempts jet fuel from its state motor fuels tax is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Colorado does not have a law that allows residents to print ballots from their home computers and then encourages them to turn ballots over to collectors. Colorado's mail-in voting system does allow residents to request and receive ballots by mail, but the process does not involve printing ballots at home. Additionally, the practice of ""ballot harvesting"" is illegal in Colorado, where it is a felony to collect and submit ballots on behalf of others.

"Explanation: The claim that ""not a single soldier died in combat during the Eisenhower Administration"" is false. During the Eisenhower Administration, which lasted from 1953 to 1961, the United States was involved in the Korean War and the early stages of the Vietnam War. Both of these conflicts resulted in American casualties. For example, the Korean War alone resulted in over 36,000 American deaths.

"Explanation: The Keystone XL pipeline is a proposed oil pipeline that would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States. The pipeline has been a subject of controversy and debate, with some supporting its construction for economic reasons and others opposing it due to environmental concerns.

"Explanation: The claim that by 2015, the United States would be sending so much interest to China that it would be paying for the entire People's Liberation Army is highly unlikely and not supported by any credible sources.

"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has 77 different means-tested social welfare programs is not accurate. While the federal government does have numerous social welfare programs, the exact number of means-tested programs can vary depending on the source and the definition of ""means-tested.""

"Explanation: The claim is false. The fiscal cliff refers to a series of tax increases and spending cuts that were scheduled to take effect at the beginning of 2013. However, lawmakers did not fail to avert the fiscal cliff. In fact, they passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which averted the fiscal cliff and prevented the automatic spending cuts and tax increases. Therefore, the claim that 18 percent of the federal money sent to the states would be eliminated is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000 in 2011 is false.

He was known for his work on issues such as economic development, education, and healthcare.

The new Arizona immigration law, known as SB 1070, allows police to stop and check the immigration status of anyone they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" to believe is in the country illegally.

"Explanation: The claim that every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases, is not universally true. While some studies suggest that a minimum wage increase can lead to a small increase in unemployment, particularly among low-skilled workers, other studies find no significant effect or even a positive effect on employment. The impact of a minimum wage increase on employment depends on various factors, including the size of the increase, the industry, and the overall economic conditions. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time the minimum wage is raised, the number of jobless people increases.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law is true. In 1973, the Trump Management Company was sued by the Justice Department for discriminatory housing practices. The company was accused of refusing to rent apartments to African-Americans and other minorities. The case was settled out of court, with the Trump Organization agreeing to pay $1 million in damages and to rent apartments to minorities. This incident is well-documented in various sources, including the New York Times and the Washington Post.

"Explanation: The National Park Service (NPS) is a federal agency in the United States, while the city of Austin is a local government entity.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Virginia's ban on felons from voting is a Jim Crow-era law is false. The Jim Crow laws were a series of state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. These laws were enacted between 1877 and 1950, and they were designed to disenfranchise and discriminate against African Americans. Virginia's current felon disenfranchisement law, which was passed in 1902, is not a Jim Crow-era law. It was passed before the Jim Crow era and was not intended to target African Americans specifically.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teenagers or young people is likely false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021, about 14% of minimum wage workers were between the ages of 16 and 19, and 25% were between the ages of 20 and 24. This means that a significant portion of minimum wage workers are indeed teenagers or young adults, not just one out of 10.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the national economic recovery and its impact on state tax revenues and budget surpluses. While it is true that many states have experienced economic growth and increased tax revenues, it is not accurate to say that nearly every state has seen higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses. The economic recovery has been uneven, with some states benefiting more than others. Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is made by the Trump family, and it is a statement about their net worth when they moved into the White House. The claim is that they had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman.

The Trump family's net worth was estimated to be around $3.7 billion, while the Truman family's net worth was much lower.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that easing restrictions on selling alcohol on Sundays will result in more traffic crashes and fatalities is based on the assumption that increased alcohol consumption will lead to more impaired driving. While it is true that alcohol consumption can impair judgment and motor skills, leading to an increased risk of traffic crashes and fatalities, the claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that easing restrictions on Sunday alcohol sales will directly cause more crashes and fatalities. The impact of such a policy change would depend on various factors, including the current alcohol consumption patterns, enforcement of drunk driving laws, and public awareness campaigns.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Tea Party is not a registered political party in the United States, and therefore, it does not have official polling data like the Republican and Democratic parties. Polling data for political parties typically refers to the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of individuals on death row who have completed all appellate review and are awaiting the governor's signature on a death warrant is not approximately 40.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Proposition 57, also known as the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016, is a California ballot initiative that was passed in 2016. It aims to reduce the state prison population by allowing non-violent, non-serious offenders to be eligible for parole after serving the full term of their primary offense. However, it does not provide any form of immunity or ""get out of jail free"" card for violent crimes such as drive-by shootings or discharging guns on a school yard. These actions are still considered serious crimes and would result in severe penalties, including long jail sentences. Therefore, the claim that Proposition 57 would allow individuals to commit these crimes and ""get out of jail free"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim refers to a group of senators known as the ""Gang of 14,"" which was formed in 2007 to prevent the Senate from becoming gridlocked. The group consisted of seven Republicans and seven Democrats. The claim also mentions that Sen. Obama (Barack Obama) had the opportunity to join this group but chose not to. However, Sen. Obama was not a senator in 2007; he was a senator-elect at the time and was not yet in office. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Nathan Deal has taken at least $15,600 from the Koch brothers, their businesses, and their employees is false. There is no evidence or record of such a transaction.

"Explanation: The claim about a man using bath salts and having raccoons set fire inside his home and steal his cell phone is highly unlikely. Bath salts are a type of drug that can cause hallucinations and paranoia, but they do not cause raccoons to set fires or steal cell phones. Raccoons are not known to use tools or set fires, and they typically do not steal cell phones. This claim appears to be a mix of fact and fiction, with the bath salts and raccoons elements being false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplified calculation that does not account for the fact that Medicare taxes are paid over a lifetime, while benefits are received over a shorter period. The claim also does not consider the fact that Medicare taxes are paid by both the employee and the employer, and that the benefits are not solely for the retiree but also for their spouse and dependents. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that Medicare benefits are not received in a lump sum but are spread out over the retiree's lifetime.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific year (2010) and provides a combined figure for the top 10 CEOs' salaries. However, it does not provide a source or specific data to verify the claim. Additionally, the claim about the average American worker's wage rising by just 2 percent is not directly related to the CEOs' salaries and does not provide a source for this information either. Therefore, without a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population is supported by several studies and reports. For instance, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that law enforcement officers have a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other causes compared to the general population. This increased risk is often attributed to the stress and physical demands of the job, as well as exposure to hazards. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that suicide is caused by a federal government policy of giving people something for nothing is a misinterpretation and a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) does not infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms. The treaty aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, including small arms and light weapons, to prevent their diversion to unauthorized users. It does not restrict the ownership of firearms within a country's borders. The treaty's provisions are designed to promote responsible arms transfers and prevent the proliferation of weapons that could be used in human rights abuses or terrorism. Therefore, the claim that the U.N. Arms Treaty infringes upon the right to keep and bear arms is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the House and Republican, has historically been a skeptic of the scientific consensus on global warming. Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and current Speaker of the House, is a strong advocate for addressing climate change.

Therefore, the claim that Newt Gingrich is aligned with Nancy Pelosi on global warming is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Purim is ""their version of Halloween here"" is false. Purim and Halloween are distinct holidays with different origins, traditions, and purposes. Purim is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people in the ancient Persian Empire from a plot to annihilate them. It is celebrated with a public reading of the Book of Esther, giving gifts to the poor, and a festive meal. In contrast, Halloween is a secular holiday that originated in the United States and is celebrated with activities like trick-or-treating, wearing costumes, and decorating with pumpkins and ghosts. While both holidays involve some form of celebration and dressing up, they are not interchangeable or equivalent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the IRS, in 2019, about 44% of Americans did not pay any federal income tax. However, this does not mean that they do not pay any taxes at all. Many Americans pay other types of taxes, such as payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare), state and local taxes, and property taxes. Additionally, the wealthiest Americans do pay a significant portion of the federal income tax. In 2019, the top 1% of earners paid 40.1% of the total federal income tax collected.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the assets of the six largest banks in the United States over two different time periods. The first part of the claim states that 15 years ago, the assets of the six largest banks totaled 17 percent of GDP. The second part of the claim states that today, the assets of the six largest banks total 63 percent of GDP. These figures are not directly comparable because they are from different time periods and the economic conditions may have changed significantly over those 15 years. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as it stands without additional context or data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States became a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products in 2019 and has been a net exporter since then. This means that the U.S. produces more oil than it imports from other countries.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the largest category of people coming into technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees is likely false. Technical schools typically attract individuals who are seeking vocational training or have completed high school or some college, rather than those with four-year degrees. The primary goal of technical schools is to provide hands-on training for specific trades and industries, which is often more appealing to those who have completed high school or some college-level education.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years is false. Brazil is still a significant oil producer and exporter. In fact, Brazil is one of the world's largest oil producers, with the discovery of the pre-salt oil fields in the 2000s significantly increasing its oil production. As of 2021, Brazil is the 12th largest oil producer globally and the 10th largest exporter.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Louisiana gets ""not one single penny"" from Gulf Coast offshore oil revenues is false.

The state receives a portion of the revenue generated from leases and sales of oil and gas rights in the federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). This revenue is used for various purposes, including coastal restoration and conservation projects.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not make it unlawful for individuals to not purchase health insurance. The ACA's individual mandate, which required most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, was repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. However, the mandate itself was not deemed unlawful; it was simply repealed. Therefore, there is no law that makes not purchasing health insurance unlawful.

"Explanation: The claim that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt felt there was no need for collective bargaining in the public sector because ""the government is the people"" is a misinterpretation of his views. Roosevelt was a strong advocate for labor rights and supported collective bargaining for private sector workers.

Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that Georgia ranks No. 9 in the rate of women murdered by men is not accurate. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the rate of intentional homicide of women by men varies by country, and Georgia does not rank No. 9 in this category.

However, the claim that ""buyers can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks"" is misleading. The proposal in question was the ""Manchin-Toomey Amendment,"" which would have expanded background checks to cover gun shows and online sales. Ayotte's vote was against this specific proposal, not against background checks in general. Therefore, the claim is false.

The Texas Education Code requires that schools provide instruction on human sexuality, but the curriculum must be age-appropriate and medically accurate. However, schools are not required to teach comprehensive sex education, which includes topics like contraception, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Therefore, the claim that ""schools do not even have to teach sex education"" is false.

"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While it is accurate that certain areas in the United States, such as Oakland and Ferguson, have higher crime rates compared to other parts of the country, it is an oversimplification to say that these places are among the most dangerous in the world.

Additionally, it is important to note that crime rates can vary significantly within a city, and many areas in these cities are not as dangerous as the overall statistics might suggest.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Bush's tax cuts for high earners have been the biggest contributor to the budget deficit is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the Bush-era tax cuts, particularly those for high earners, did contribute to the budget deficit, they were not the sole or even the primary cause. Other factors, such as increased military spending, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the economic downturn following the 2008 financial crisis, also played significant roles in the growth of the budget deficit during the Bush administration. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely true.

"Explanation: Sen. Barbara Boxer was a prominent figure in the U.S. Senate and was known for her stance on immigration reform. However, the claim that she voted against immigration reform to permit Hispanic immigrants to come here legally to work is misleading. Sen. Boxer was a strong advocate for comprehensive immigration reform and supported measures to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. She voted in favor of the DREAM Act and other immigration reform bills. Therefore, the claim that she voted against immigration reform to prevent Hispanic immigrants from coming here legally is false.

"Explanation: The claim that the only growth sector in America in the last two years has been government growth is misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the plan or the costs it aims to reduce. It also does not specify who ""many observers"" are or what their credentials are.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, as of 2021, 38 states have appointed, rather than elected, state school superintendents.

The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the dogs' contributions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about tourism in Ohio can be verified by checking reliable sources such as the Ohio Department of Commerce or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the Ohio Department of Commerce, tourism in Ohio supports over 439,000 jobs and generates over $36 billion in annual spending. These figures are consistent with the claim made.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the growth in food stamp usage did not keep pace with the increase in unemployment. This statement is generally true. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in unemployment, but the growth in food stamp usage, while substantial, did not match the rate of increase in unemployment. This discrepancy can be attributed to various factors, including the timing of stimulus payments and the implementation of unemployment benefits.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days after the shootings of Dallas policemen.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the gender wage gap, which is a well-documented phenomenon. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2020, women in Oregon earned 83.4% of what men earned, which is approximately 79 cents for every dollar paid to men. The claim then uses this figure to calculate the potential benefits if the wage gap were eliminated. The calculations are based on the average cost of gas, food, and rent in Oregon, which are reasonable assumptions. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: House Bill 2 (HB2), also known as the ""Bathroom Bill,"" was a controversial law passed in North Carolina in 2016. It required individuals to use public restrooms that corresponded to their birth sex, rather than their gender identity. This law was widely criticized for discriminating against transgender individuals and was later repealed in 2017. The claim that ""We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina with the passage of HB2"" is false because HB2 did indeed take away certain rights, specifically the right of transgender individuals to use restrooms that align with their gender identity.

"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders have identical positions on healthcare is false. While all three candidates have proposed healthcare reforms, their plans differ significantly. Hillary Clinton's plan, for instance, was to expand the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), while Bernie Sanders proposed a Medicare for All system. Donald Trump's plan involved repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. None of these plans put the government in charge of both the patient and the doctor, as the claim suggests.

They were founded in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings, and have been continuously operating since then, with the exception of a brief period in the 1950s when they were known as the Milwaukee Braves.

"Explanation: The claim that there are 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day is not accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, as of 2021, there are approximately 20 million veterans in the United States. However, the number of veterans who are homeless or on the street at any given time is significantly lower. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that around 40,000 veterans are homeless on any given night. Therefore, the claim that there are 200,000 to 400,000 veterans on the street is an exaggeration.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The New York Times article on Donald Trump's tax returns did not wait until paragraph 18 to point out that there was no wrongdoing. The article's headline and the first few paragraphs clearly stated that the documents showed no evidence of tax fraud or illegal activities. The claim misrepresents the content and structure of the article.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mexico does not have birthright citizenship and that Americans are the only ones to have it is false. Mexico does have birthright citizenship, which means that anyone born in Mexico is automatically a Mexican citizen. The United States is one of the few countries that grants citizenship to anyone born within its borders, regardless of the parents' immigration status, but this is not the only country with such a policy. Other countries, including Mexico, also have similar provisions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Richmond is the most vegan-friendly city is not accurate. While Richmond does have a growing vegan scene with numerous vegan restaurants and shops, it is not the most vegan-friendly city in the United States. Cities like Portland, Oregon, and Austin, Texas, are often cited as more vegan-friendly due to their larger number of vegan options, vegan-friendly policies, and overall vegan culture.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama, who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017, did not start talking about running for president until 2007.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no official announcement or evidence that the president has released all of the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR is a stockpile of oil maintained by the U.S. government to ensure energy security and stabilize prices in case of emergencies. The release of oil from the SPR is typically done in response to specific events, such as natural disasters or market disruptions, and is not a routine or ongoing process.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama administration did not intend to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists is a complex issue that has been debated in various contexts. While it is true that some extremist groups have used Trump's rhetoric and policies to recruit new members, it is not accurate to say that he is being used as a ""recruiting tool"" in the same way that a specific organization or individual might be. The claim is vague and lacks specific evidence to support it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On a cap-and-trade plan"" is incomplete and lacks context. A cap-and-trade plan is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, where a limit (cap) is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted, and companies can trade emission allowances. Without additional information about the specific context or details of the claim, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Lyndon B. Johnson's stance on civil rights was complex and evolved over time. While it is true that he initially opposed many civil rights measures during his early years in Congress, he later became a strong advocate for civil rights legislation. In 1957, he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, but by the time he became President in 1963, he had shifted his position and played a crucial role in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Therefore, the claim that he opposed every civil rights measure that came up for a vote during his first 20 years in Congress is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Keystone XL pipeline would employ 20,000 people in the United States is an overestimation. While the pipeline's construction would create jobs, the actual number of jobs created is significantly lower. According to various studies and reports, the Keystone XL pipeline would create around 4,000 to 6,000 jobs during construction, with a smaller number of permanent jobs after completion. Therefore, the claim that it would employ 20,000 people is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, cyclists are required to follow the same traffic rules as motor vehicles. This means that cyclists must yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, and they must not block the crosswalk. Dipping a wheel into the road does not give cyclists any special legal rights to stop traffic. Cyclists must use hand signals and follow traffic signals just like any other vehicle.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Joe Garcia is a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the 23rd congressional district of Texas. He served from 2013 to 2019.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less on healthcare is not accurate. According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks 38th in life expectancy at birth, while many countries with lower healthcare spending, such as Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland, rank much higher. Additionally, the U.S. spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but this does not translate to a longer lifespan. The claim oversimplifies the complex relationship between healthcare spending and life expectancy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. There have been instances where Republican lawmakers who voted against the stimulus package have later attended events and claimed credit for projects funded by the stimulus.

"Explanation: The claim that a proposed immigration bill will bankrupt Georgia if passed is a generalization and lacks specific evidence or data to support it.

Without specific details about the bill and its potential economic impacts, it is not possible to accurately assess the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a large majority of Republicans believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim and not U.S.-born is false. While there have been some conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns suggesting that Obama is not a U.S.-born citizen or is a Muslim, these claims are not supported by evidence and are widely rejected by fact-checking organizations. Polls and surveys have shown that a significant portion of Republicans do not believe these claims, and the majority of Republicans do not hold these views.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Washington D.C.-area never has a recession is false. While the D.C. area has experienced economic growth and stability, it has not been immune to economic downturns. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the D.C. area experienced job losses and economic slowdown, similar to other regions in the United States. Therefore, the claim that the D.C.-area never has a recession is inaccurate.

"Explanation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2010, was designed to address the causes of the 2008 financial crisis. While it has had significant impacts on the banking industry, including increased regulatory requirements and capital requirements, it is not accurate to say that it is ""destroying"" community banks. Many community banks have adapted to the new regulations and continue to operate, although some have faced challenges. The claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that an entry-level janitor in New York City gets paid twice as much as an entry-level teacher is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for a janitor in New York City was $35,000 in 2020, while the median annual wage for a kindergarten teacher was $55,000. Therefore, the janitor earns less than half of what an entry-level teacher earns.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there is no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections is false. There is a significant body of research and historical data that shows a correlation between primary turnout and the success of candidates in the general election. Higher primary turnout often indicates a more engaged and mobilized electorate, which can translate to better performance in the general election. Therefore, the claim is not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Africa is spending the highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world is not accurate. According to the World Bank, in 2019, the average expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP in Africa was around 4.4%, which is lower than the global average of 4.8%. Countries like South Korea and the United States spend a higher percentage of their GDP on education.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that any academic benefits of government-funded preschool disappear by the fourth grade is not supported by recent studies. Research has shown that the benefits of preschool education can last well beyond the fourth grade. For instance, a study published in the journal ""Science"" in 2019 found that children who attended high-quality preschool programs had better academic outcomes and were more likely to graduate from high school and attend college. Another study by the Brookings Institution in 2018 also found that the benefits of preschool education can persist into adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a common misconception about income tax distribution. While it is true that the top 1 percent of income earners often pay a significant portion of income taxes, the statement that those at the bottom pay little or nothing is an oversimplification. Many low-income individuals do not pay income taxes because they have little or no taxable income, but they do pay other taxes such as sales taxes, property taxes, and payroll taxes. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a particular state has more children's hospitals than any other state in the union is not verifiable without specific data. The number of children's hospitals can vary based on population, healthcare needs, and other factors.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that many workers in Malaysia are indentured servants because their passports are taken away and they work in slave-like conditions is a misrepresentation of the situation. While it is true that some workers in Malaysia, particularly those from countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Indonesia, may face exploitation and have their passports held by their employers, this does not constitute indentured servitude. Indentured servitude is a legal term that refers to a contract of labor for a fixed period, often with the promise of freedom upon completion. In Malaysia, while there are issues of exploitation and abuse, the legal status of workers is not that of indentured servants. The claim also oversimplifies the complex issues of labor migration and exploitation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor was called a racist is false. While there have been criticisms and controversies surrounding her statements and rulings, the specific claim that she was called a racist by a particular individual or group is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""ninety six percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses"" is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The tax deduction for charitable donations is the same for everyone, regardless of their income level.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, has indeed expressed support for Arizona's immigration law, SB 1070, which requires law enforcement to check the immigration status of individuals they suspect are in the country illegally. However, he has also stated that he believes the law should be implemented in a way that is consistent with the Constitution and that it should not be used to target individuals based on their race or ethnicity. Therefore, while he has supported the law as a model, he has also expressed concerns about its implementation and potential misuse.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that individuals with mental illnesses die an average of 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness is true. This is supported by numerous studies and reports, including a 2014 study published in the journal ""Lancet Psychiatry"" which found that people with mental health conditions die on average 10-20 years earlier than those without. This is often due to a combination of factors including higher rates of physical health conditions, substance abuse, and suicide.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the government, not the armed forces, is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use is false. The U.S. government does not stockpile ammunition for domestic use. The U.S. military, not the government, is responsible for stockpiling ammunition for its own use. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the military's stockpiling activities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Six of Georgia's counties have no lawyers at all"" is false. According to the American Bar Association, as of 2021, there are 159 counties in Georgia, and it is highly unlikely that six of them have no lawyers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are back on the battlefield is false. The five detainees, who were released in exchange for Bergdahl, have not been reported to have returned to the battlefield.

Therefore, the claim that Georgia is near the bottom among states for SAT scores and graduation rates is true.

"Explanation: The claim that the United States government has increased its employment base by 176,000 people in the last four years is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total employment in the federal government has been relatively stable over the past four years. In fact, the federal government's employment has decreased slightly from 2.7 million in 2017 to 2.6 million in 2021. Therefore, the claim that the government has increased its employment base by 176,000 people is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual's legal actions and political stances. To verify the claim, we need to check if the person in question has indeed sued gun manufacturers and if they were supportive of Brady and assault weapon bans. Without specific names or additional context, it's challenging to confirm the claim's accuracy. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a well-known public figure, such as a politician or activist, we can look up their history to verify the claim.

"Explanation: The claim that the wealth gap between blacks and whites in the United States is greater than the black-white wealth gap in apartheid South Africa is false. While the wealth gap in the United States is significant, it is not greater than the wealth gap in apartheid South Africa. In apartheid South Africa, the wealth gap was extreme due to the systematic and legalized discrimination against the black population. In contrast, while the United States has a significant wealth gap, it is not as extreme as the gap in apartheid South Africa.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, redistricting commissions are typically established by state legislatures or through ballot initiatives. The members of these commissions are usually appointed or elected, and they are subject to various ethical standards and laws. If a member of a redistricting commission were to accept a bribe, they would be subject to legal consequences, including removal from the commission. The claim that a member could not be removed is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme is false. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading. Social Security, on the other hand, is a government-run program that collects taxes from workers and uses those funds to pay benefits to retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased workers. The funds are not used to pay off earlier investors, but rather to provide benefits to current and future retirees based on a pay-as-you-go system. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of a Ponzi scheme.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the vast majority of Syrian refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work is a generalization that does not accurately reflect the diversity of the Syrian refugee population. According to various studies and reports from organizations like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Syrian refugee population is diverse and includes people of all ages, genders, and abilities. While it is true that some refugees are young men seeking work, the majority of refugees are women, children, elderly, and those with disabilities. The claim also overlooks the fact that many refugees are fleeing conflict and seeking safety, not necessarily work.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Scott Walker, a former governor of Wisconsin and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, has been known for his strong stance against abortion. He has supported restrictions on abortion, including a 20-week ban and a requirement for women to view an ultrasound before having an abortion. While his views are indeed restrictive, it is difficult to definitively say that his views are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times. Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush also had strong anti-abortion stances, and some of their policies were similarly restrictive. Therefore, the claim that Walker's views are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, known as the ""Ryan Budget"" or ""Ryan Plan,"" was a part of the 2012 Republican budget proposal. It did not allow insurance companies to deny coverage or drop people for pre-existing conditions. Instead, it aimed to reduce the federal deficit by making changes to Medicare and other programs. The proposal was criticized for potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries and was not enacted into law.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that of the four statewide races this century within a 300-vote margin, three have been overturned in a recount. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that three out of four such races have been overturned. In fact, only one of the four races within a 300-vote margin in this century has been overturned in a recount. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, the vaccination rate in Texas has not reached 95%. The actual vaccination rate in Texas has been fluctuating but has not exceeded 80% as of the latest data available. Therefore, the claim that the vaccination rate was 95% when the person left office is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Central Health is the only hospital district in Texas that spends taxpayer dollars on abortions is false. While Central Health does provide abortion services, it is not the only hospital district in Texas that does so. Other hospital districts in Texas, such as Harris Health System and Parkland Health and Hospital System, also provide abortion services. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about restoring voting rights to non-violent felons is a complex issue that varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, for example, some states have laws that automatically restore voting rights to non-violent felons upon completion of their sentences, while others do not. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context and location.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that stories about a person's birth certificate drowned out media coverage of the Republican and White House budget plans. However, there is no specific evidence or context provided to support this claim. Without concrete information or sources, it is not possible to verify the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of positions eliminated by Chesterfield County's general government operations to the number of positions eliminated by the entire state government of Virginia since 2009. To verify this claim, one would need to obtain specific data on the number of positions eliminated in both entities over the specified period. Without such data, it is impossible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it requires specific data to be verified.)"
"Explanation: The claim that the Koch network is spending more money in a Senate race in Ohio than anywhere else in the country is not accurate. While the Koch network has been active in various political races across the country, including in Ohio, there is no evidence to suggest that they are spending more money in Ohio than in any other state. The Koch network's spending is often targeted at specific races and issues, but it is not accurate to say that they are spending more in Ohio than anywhere else.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the government does not need a warrant to read your old emails is false. In most jurisdictions, including the United States, the government generally needs a warrant or other legal authorization to access private communications, including old emails. This is governed by laws such as the Fourth Amendment in the U.S., which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, there are exceptions and specific circumstances where such access might be permitted without a warrant, but these are typically limited and require a high standard of evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""The poorest in this country are women"" is a generalization and can be misleading. While it is true that women often face unique challenges such as the gender wage gap and higher rates of poverty due to factors like caregiving responsibilities and lack of access to education and economic opportunities, it is not accurate to say that all women are the poorest in the country. Poverty is a complex issue influenced by various factors including race, ethnicity, age, and geographical location. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Dow Chemical's decision to build a plant in Saudi Arabia rather than Oklahoma is primarily driven by economic factors, such as access to natural gas and other resources, rather than environmental regulations. The company's official statements and reports indicate that the decision was based on strategic business considerations, including market demand and resource availability.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The IRS has not erased 24,000 emails related to the Tea Party groups. The IRS has stated that the emails were not intentionally destroyed, and the agency has been cooperating with Congress in its investigation. The claim is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Newark was paying 80 percent of its school budget from local property taxes is not accurate. According to the Newark Public Schools' budget reports, the percentage of the budget funded by local property taxes is typically around 30-40%, not 80%. The majority of the budget is funded by state and federal sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""In every state, women are paid less than men"" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that, on average, women earn less than men in many states, there are exceptions. For instance, in some states, women may earn more than men on average. Additionally, the wage gap can vary significantly depending on the specific occupation, industry, and other factors. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has indeed proposed various immigration reform plans that include legalizing certain groups of undocumented immigrants. However, the specific claim that he has said we should make the 11 million illegal workers legal is not a direct quote from him. He has advocated for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but the exact number of 11 million is not part of his specific proposals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama 'only wants your children to have health insurance'"" is a misrepresentation of President Obama's policies. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did expand health insurance coverage for children, it also aimed to provide health insurance for adults and improve the overall healthcare system. The claim simplifies and misrepresents the broader goals and impacts of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Josh Mandel, a former Ohio state treasurer and current U.S. Senate candidate, has publicly opposed federal loans to the auto industry. He has argued that such loans are not necessary and that the industry should be allowed to stand on its own merits. This opposition is well-documented in various news articles and political statements.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal law known as the ""Gun Control Act of 1968"" prohibits individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes from possessing firearms. This law applies to gun shows and other retail sales of firearms. While there may be some loopholes or inconsistencies in the enforcement of these laws, the claim that convicted abusers can simply walk into a gun show and purchase a gun without any questions asked is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the high-speed rail project creating 60,000-plus jobs for Floridians is based on a study conducted by the Florida Department of Transportation. The study estimated that the project would create approximately 60,000 jobs during the construction phase. This claim is supported by official sources and is therefore likely to be true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Today almost half our debt is owned by foreigners"" is not accurate. According to the latest data from the U.S. Treasury Department, as of the end of 2021, foreign investors held about 30% of the U.S. public debt. This percentage has been fluctuating over time but has not reached the ""almost half"" threshold.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a specific Republican was the only one to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. To verify this claim, I would need to check the voting records of the House of Representatives for the specific vote in question. However, without specific details about the vote and the member's name, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has a track record of not raising taxes"" is vague and does not provide specific details or evidence. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need more context, such as the name of the person making the claim, the specific time period, and the political or economic context. Without this information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""Were No. 1 in child hunger"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. It is not clear what ""Were No. 1"" refers to (e.g., a country, a year, a specific metric). Without additional information, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Therefore, it cannot be accurately judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Glenn Hegar, the Texas Lieutenant Governor, has been a vocal advocate for reducing public school funding. He has supported legislation that has led to cuts in public school funding. Therefore, it is plausible that he expressed pride in these cuts.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas is false. The U.S. government has long maintained a policy of not providing direct aid to Hamas due to its designation as a terrorist organization. The U.S. has provided humanitarian aid to Gaza through other channels, but this has been done through international organizations and not directly to Hamas. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of U.S. foreign policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is making voting more difficult by closing Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices where low-income voters live is a misrepresentation of the facts. The DMV office closures are part of a broader effort to consolidate and streamline government services, not specifically targeted at low-income voters. Additionally, the closures do not directly impact voting, as voters can still register and vote at other DMV offices or through other methods such as absentee voting or early voting.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the alternative to higher state worker pension and health care payments is to lay off 1,500 state employees or remove 200,000 children from Medicaid-related programs. This claim is false because it presents a false dichotomy. The alternative to higher state worker pension and health care payments is not necessarily to lay off employees or remove children from Medicaid. There are other options such as reducing other state expenditures, increasing taxes, or finding other sources of revenue. The claim also does not provide any evidence or context to support the numbers given (1,500 layoffs and 200,000 children).

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we actually don't have that many public employees and are well below average in the number of public employees is false. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United States has one of the highest levels of public employment among developed countries. As of 2021, the U.S. had approximately 2.1 million federal employees, which is a significant number compared to other countries. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has a low number of public employees is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Walton family, through their holding company Walton Enterprises, does indeed have significant wealth, but it is not accurate to say that they own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America. According to Forbes, the Walton family's wealth is estimated to be around $200 billion, while the bottom 40 percent of Americans have a combined wealth of around $1.5 trillion. Therefore, the claim that the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On high-speed rail"" is incomplete and lacks specific context or details. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false. High-speed rail systems exist in various countries, but the claim does not specify a particular context or claim about them.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) regularly publishes reports on programs at high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. The GAO's High-Risk List for Fiscal Year 2021, for example, includes programs such as the Department of Defense's acquisition programs, the Department of Health and Human Services' Medicare program, and the Internal Revenue Service's tax administration program. These programs are not targeted for elimination or severe cutback in House Republican spending plans, but they are listed as high-risk programs by the GAO.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton has said she is going to ""wipe out the Second Amendment"" is false. Hillary Clinton has never made such a statement. She has consistently supported gun control measures, but her proposals have not included the elimination of the Second Amendment. Additionally, the claim that she does not believe in the First Amendment is also false. Hillary Clinton has publicly supported freedom of speech and the First Amendment. The claim that she believes in big government and that this flies in the face of the 10th Amendment is also misleading. Hillary Clinton has supported some government programs and regulations, but she has also advocated for states' rights and has not proposed a complete disregard for the 10th Amendment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that voter fraud provided a portion of the margin of victory of Democrat John Lehman over Republican Sen. Van Wanggaard in a state Senate recall election is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. The election results were certified by the appropriate authorities, and no significant allegations of voter fraud were made or substantiated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Georgia's illegal immigration crackdown laws should be called the ""Brown Codes"" due to their similarity to the Black Codes is a misinterpretation of historical context and a misuse of terminology. The Black Codes were a set of laws passed in the Southern United States after the Civil War to control and subjugate the newly freed slaves. The term ""Brown Codes"" is not a recognized historical term and does not have a specific meaning in the context of immigration laws. The comparison between the two sets of laws is not accurate or appropriate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by incoming House Speaker Dean Cannon and incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos regarding their plans for the next legislative session. This information is typically reported by reputable news sources, and there is no indication that the claim is false. The statement is a public announcement of their intentions, which is a common practice for incoming legislative leaders.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's comment about extremists being a ""JV team"" was not specifically referring to Islamic State is false. Trump's comment was made in the context of discussing the Islamic State and other extremist groups. He said, ""We're leading a coalition that is going to be very successful.

"Explanation: Texas does not have a state-level equal pay law, but it is not accurate to say that it is one of only a handful of states without such a law.

The use of drones for targeted strikes against senior terrorist leaders, including Osama bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and other high-value targets, was a significant part of U.S. counter-terrorism strategy in the late 2000s. By 2009, several high-profile terrorist leaders had been eliminated through drone strikes.

Bush, has been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has publicly stated his opposition to it. He has also been critical of the mandate and has advocated for its repeal. There is no evidence to support the claim that he favors the mandate or was thanked by Obama for health reform support.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal government's share of the gross domestic product (GDP) has been increasing over time, not decreasing. In 2020, the federal government's share of GDP was around 24.9%, which is higher than the 20% mentioned in the claim. The claim also incorrectly states that the private sector has lost 5% of its share, which is not accurate.

The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a false statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that South Florida has experienced nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s is not accurate. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the global sea level has risen by about 8 inches (20 cm) since the 1920s. While sea-level rise can vary regionally, the claim of nine inches specifically for South Florida is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim suggests that the president of the United States visited a ward that had a high percentage of votes for him in the last election, but the vote count did not increase. This claim is not verifiable with the information provided and lacks specific details about the ward, the president's visit, and the vote count. Without concrete evidence or a source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, public employees have the right to choose whether or not to join a union, but this is not a new policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a proposal to boost the teacher pension fund puts no mandate on local government. This claim is false because the proposal to boost the teacher pension fund would likely involve some form of mandate or requirement for local governments to contribute to the fund. The specifics of the mandate would depend on the details of the proposal, but the general idea is that local governments would be required to contribute to the fund to ensure its sustainability and to meet the needs of retired teachers.

"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker said no to equal pay for equal work for women is false. Gov. Scott Walker, who served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, did not publicly oppose equal pay for equal work for women. In fact, he signed a bill into law in 2014 that prohibited employers from asking job applicants about their salary history, which is a common practice that can perpetuate wage gaps.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and appeared wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. Hillary Clinton did not spend 30 days in the hospital in 2012, and she has not been reported to have a traumatic brain injury. The claim is likely a misinterpretation of her health issues and the use of glasses for other reasons.

"Explanation: The claim that Saddam Hussein had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida is false. While there were some contacts between Saddam Hussein's regime and al-Qaida, particularly in the 1990s, these were not long-term or strategic alliances. The relationship was more opportunistic and tactical, with both parties seeking to use each other for their own purposes. The claim of a 10-year relationship is an exaggeration and not supported by historical evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""every 85 visitors create one Florida job"" is a generalization that does not provide specific context or data to support it. The relationship between tourism and job creation can vary greatly depending on factors such as the type of tourism, the local economy, and the specific businesses involved. Without specific data or studies to back up this claim, it is not accurate to say that every 85 visitors create one job.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Lower Manhattan (Manhattan Community District 1) in 2010 was approximately 100,000 people. By 2020, the population had increased to around 120,000 people, which is a 20% increase, not a doubling. In contrast, the combined population of Atlanta, Dallas, and Philadelphia in 2020 was approximately 5.5 million people, which is significantly higher than the population of Lower Manhattan.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the American slave trade caused 5 million deaths or more is an exaggeration. While the transatlantic slave trade was a brutal and deadly enterprise, the number of deaths is estimated to be around 1.8 million, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database. This figure includes deaths during the Middle Passage, as well as those who died in the Americas due to harsh conditions and diseases. Therefore, the claim that the American slave trade caused 5 million deaths or more is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Saints will go undefeated and win the Super Bowl is a prediction about future events.

Therefore, this claim cannot be evaluated as true or false based on current information.

Answer: N/A"
"Explanation: The claim that a particular General Assembly is one of the most expensive, per capita, in the entire country is difficult to verify without specific data.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of job losses in Florida due to the stimulus program is not accurately represented by the figure of 211,000.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the city of Providence had the lowest crime rate in 30 years during the time the speaker was mayor is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to compare crime rates during the speaker's tenure with historical data from the past 30 years. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of Obamacare is false. Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was designed to expand access to health insurance, not reduce it. The ACA has actually increased the number of people with health insurance in Kansas and across the country. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsured rate in Kansas decreased from 14.9% in 2013 to 7.5% in 2019, which is a significant reduction in the number of uninsured individuals. Therefore, the claim that 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance due to Obamacare is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The United Nations (U.N.) does not have the authority to create or enforce gun laws within the United States. The U.S. government would need to ratify any U.N. treaty on conventional arms, but this would not automatically subject U.S. citizens to those gun laws. The U.S. Constitution and federal laws would still govern gun ownership and use within the country.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""most of our new jobs have been part-time jobs since Obamacare became law"" is not accurate. While it is true that the number of part-time jobs has increased since the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was implemented, this is not the primary reason for the increase in part-time jobs. The increase in part-time jobs is more likely due to economic factors such as the Great Recession, changes in the job market, and the preferences of employers and employees. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that ""most"" new jobs have been part-time.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""We have killed lots of innocent people in the state of Texas"" is a broad and vague statement that lacks specific context or evidence. It is not possible to accurately assess the truth of this claim without more detailed information about who is making the claim, the time period, and the specific incidents being referred to. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits health insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to individuals based on pre-existing conditions, including domestic violence.

While there may be some exceptions or nuances in specific cases, the general rule is that health insurance companies cannot deny coverage based on a history of domestic violence.

"Explanation: Dan Seals, a former Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2018, was born in 1959.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Miami Dolphins are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes is false. All NFL teams pay property taxes on their stadiums and other properties.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: According to a 2021 report by Child Care Aware of America, the average annual cost of child care in the United States is $10,750 for a child in a center-based program. Meanwhile, the average cost of tuition for a four-year public college in the 2020-2021 academic year was $10,560. However, costs can vary significantly by state. For example, in California, the average annual cost of child care is $14,000, which exceeds the average cost of tuition in the state. Therefore, the claim that child care costs in some states now exceed the average price tag for college tuition is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that 85% of the funds collected in each county will be redistributed elsewhere, not spent in the county in which it is collected. This claim is false because it is not based on any specific policy or law. The redistribution of funds is typically determined by the government or the organization collecting the funds, and the percentage redistributed can vary greatly depending on the context and the specific policy in place.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay in the U.S. is 475 to 1 is based on a study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) in 2018.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that more than 100,000 women in Texas have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone is not supported by credible sources. The Texas Department of Health and Human Services does not provide specific data on self-induced abortions, and the claim is not backed by any reputable news outlets or studies. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of data on abortion access and methods.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the platform of the Republican Party says ""deport everybody and to hell with it"" is a misrepresentation of the party's actual stance. The Republican Party's official platform does not contain such language. The party's platform focuses on issues such as immigration reform, border security, and the enforcement of immigration laws, but it does not advocate for the mass deportation of all immigrants. The phrase ""deport everybody and to hell with it"" is not found in the party's official documents.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote is false. Noncitizens, by definition, are not eligible to vote in most countries, including the United States. Therefore, it is not possible for 14 percent of noncitizens to be registered to vote.

"Explanation: The claim that ""thirty-four percent of Hispanics don't have any health care at all, don't have any health insurance"" is based on a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2019. The study found that 34% of uninsured adults in the United States are Hispanic. However, this does not mean that 34% of all Hispanics are uninsured, as the study does not provide data on the total Hispanic population. Therefore, the claim is false as it generalizes the data to all Hispanics.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that state employees will have to pay 100 percent of their pensions and health insurance after 2012 is false. This is because the specific details of pension and health insurance contributions for state employees are typically outlined in collective bargaining agreements or state laws, and such a significant change would require legislative action or collective bargaining negotiations. There is no evidence to support that such a change occurred after 2012.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that members of Congress did not have three days to read the bill when the stimulus was rushed into law is false. The CARES Act, which was the stimulus bill passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, was indeed rushed through Congress. However, the claim that members of Congress did not have three days to read the bill is inaccurate. The bill was introduced on March 16, 2020, and passed on March 27, 2020, which is a period of about 11 days, not three days. Additionally, members of Congress had access to the bill's text and were able to review it before voting.

The claim that they are not even citizens of the country is inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare was patterned after Mitt Romney's plan in Massachusetts is true. Romney's health care reform in Massachusetts, known as the ""Romneycare"" plan, was implemented in 2006 and served as a model for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) signed into law by President Obama in 2010. Both plans aimed to expand health insurance coverage, although they differed in some aspects.

"Explanation: The claim that the Paul Ryan budget proposal would leave the country without Medicare is false. The Ryan budget proposal, which was introduced in 2013, did propose changes to Medicare, including raising the eligibility age and changing the program's financing structure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has one of America's toughest ethics laws is not accurate. While Georgia does have a strong ethics law, it is not considered one of the toughest in the country. For instance, states like California and New York have more stringent ethics laws, particularly in terms of campaign finance and lobbying regulations. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other sources. The statement that the wealthiest 25 percent pay 86 percent of total income taxes and the wealthiest 5 percent pay 60 percent of total income taxes is not accurate. The correct figures are as follows:
- The top 25 percent of income earners pay about 68 percent of total income taxes.
- The top 5 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of total income taxes.

These figures are based on data from the IRS and other reputable sources, such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Tax Foundation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that infant mortality within the three miles surrounding the University Circle area exceeds some Third World countries is false. Infant mortality rates are typically higher in developing countries due to factors such as lack of access to healthcare, poor nutrition, and inadequate sanitation. University Circle, located in Cleveland, Ohio, is a well-developed area with access to healthcare services, and its infant mortality rate is not significantly higher than that of many developed countries. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the infant mortality rate in the United States is around 5.6 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is lower than many Third World countries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that human activity is not causing dramatic changes to our climate is false. The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary drivers of the observed warming of the Earth's climate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests a similarity between a 1995 plot to blow up 12 jumbo jets over the Pacific Ocean and the alleged plan of Lubbock terror suspects to use baby dolls to conceal chemical explosives. However, there is no evidence or credible source that supports this claim. The 1995 plot, known as Operation Bojinka, was a complex and sophisticated plan involving multiple individuals and was not related to the use of baby dolls. The Lubbock incident, involving the use of baby dolls, is a separate event and does not have any known connection to the 1995 plot.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama has an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon is false. While the EPA under President Obama did propose regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, these regulations did not directly raise the price of gasoline. The Clean Power Plan, for example, aimed to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, but it did not target gasoline prices. The claim is a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the EPA's actions.

Answer: 0"

The ACA provides subsidies to help low- and middle-income individuals and families purchase health insurance, but it does not give everyone the same opportunity as Congress members.

"Explanation: The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) do not specify a minimum percentage of instructional time that must be spent on informational texts. The standards do emphasize the importance of informational texts and require that students read a variety of texts, including informational texts, but they do not mandate a specific proportion of time to be spent on them. Therefore, the claim that Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time on informational texts is false.

"Explanation: The claim that Margaret Thatcher told George H.W. Bush not to ""go wobbly"" is indeed an old wives' tale. The phrase ""Don't go wobbly"" is often attributed to Thatcher, but there is no verified evidence to support that she actually said this to Bush. The story is more of a myth or urban legend rather than a factual event.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that oil companies ""haven't touched"" 68 million acres where they already have rights to drill is misleading. While it is true that some oil companies may not have drilled on all the acres they have rights to, the statement implies that these acres are untouched, which is not accurate. Oil companies often conduct exploration activities, such as seismic surveys, on these acres, even if they haven't yet drilled for oil. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Phoenix, Arizona, is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City, is false. According to the FBI's 2019 Crime in the United States report, Phoenix had 1,027 kidnapping incidents, while Mexico City had 1,200. However, the FBI's data does not rank cities by the number of kidnappings, and the claim is not supported by any reliable sources.

"Explanation: The claim ""I didn't raise taxes once"" is a statement made by a politician or public figure. To evaluate its truthfulness, one would need to examine the historical record of tax policies implemented during their tenure.

However, if the claim is made by a politician, it is common for them to make such statements, and it would require independent verification to confirm its accuracy.

"Explanation: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States rations care like systems in Canada and Great Britain is misleading. The ACA does not ration care in the same way that these countries' healthcare systems do. In Canada and Great Britain, healthcare is provided through a single-payer system, which means the government funds and manages the healthcare system. In contrast, the ACA is a complex law that expands access to health insurance through private and public options, but it does not ration care in the same way as single-payer systems. The ACA does have provisions to control costs and manage healthcare spending, but it does not limit access to care based on need or ability to pay in the same way as single-payer systems.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sandra Day O'Connor had no judicial experience before joining the Supreme Court is false.

"Explanation: The claim that ""half of the primary care doctors in Massachusetts are not accepting new patients"" is not accurate. While there may be some primary care doctors who are not accepting new patients due to various reasons such as retirement, burnout, or changes in practice, it is not accurate to say that half of them are not accepting new patients. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual situation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was not a state senator and therefore did not have the authority to support or refuse measures in that capacity. Additionally, there is no record of him refusing to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we could cut unemployment in half simply by reclaiming the jobs taken by illegal workers is a simplification of a complex issue. While it is true that reducing the number of illegal workers could potentially create more jobs for legal workers, it is not accurate to say that this would cut unemployment in half. The relationship between illegal immigration and unemployment is complex and influenced by many factors, including the overall economy, job market demand, and the specific industries affected. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential economic impact of removing illegal workers, such as the loss of productivity and the need for new workers to fill the vacancies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median income in the United States has been increasing since the start of the recovery from the Great Recession. In 2010, the median income was $50,056, and by 2019, it had risen to $67,521. Therefore, the median income is not below what it was at the start of the recovery.

"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare has led to a rise in part-time employment is a complex issue that has been debated among economists and policymakers. While some studies suggest that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, may have contributed to an increase in part-time work, particularly among low-wage workers, it is not accurate to say that this is the primary or sole reason for the trend. Other factors, such as technological changes, economic conditions, and business strategies, also play significant roles in the shift towards part-time employment. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate and should be considered false.

Answer: 0"

The claim seems to misinterpret or misrepresent the purpose and provisions of the Geneva Conventions.

These games are designed to be visually engaging, and it is common for them to display gameplay and results to attract and retain players.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Census Bureau does not release figures that directly attribute population changes to tax burdens. The Census Bureau provides data on population changes, but it does not attribute those changes to specific factors like tax burdens. Therefore, the claim that the states tax burden has cost the state another 190,000 residents in 2009 is not supported by any official census figures.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of new business applications has been increasing in recent years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the top 20 percent of income earners pay nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes is generally accurate. According to data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other sources, the top 20 percent of income earners in the United States do indeed pay a significant portion of federal taxes. For example, in 2019, the top 20 percent of income earners paid approximately 69.5 percent of all federal income taxes.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a report from the Center for Responsive Politics, which is a reputable source for political spending data. The report states that in the 2020 election cycle, super PACs raised $1.6 billion, with about half of that coming from fewer than 200 donors and about 20 percent from corporations. The claim is a simplified version of this data, but it accurately reflects the overall trend. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ISIS is currently crucifying Christians in Iraq is false. While ISIS has been known to commit atrocities against various religious and ethnic groups, including Christians, there is no credible evidence to support the specific claim of crucifixions.

"Explanation: The claim that the fastest-rising expense in the U.S. Defense Department is health care is not accurate. While health care costs have been increasing, the fastest-rising expense in the U.S. Defense Department is actually personnel costs. This includes salaries, benefits, and other related expenses. The increase in personnel costs is primarily due to the growing number of military personnel and the rising costs of benefits and retirement programs.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Texas is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country is an exaggeration. While Texas has been experiencing significant population growth, it is not accurate to say it is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Texas's population growth rate has been high, but it is not double the national average. For instance, in 2020, Texas's population growth rate was around 1.4%, while the national average was around 0.4%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the importance of an independent voting record is a subjective statement that can vary based on individual perspectives and political ideologies. However, it is generally accepted that an independent voting record can indicate a politician's ability to make decisions based on their own judgment rather than party lines. This can be seen as important for several reasons, such as promoting bipartisanship, encouraging compromise, and ensuring that legislation is based on the best interests of constituents rather than party politics.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a 50-50 public-private split for paying for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena would be better than most other arena projects around the country. However, this claim is subjective and depends on the specific context and criteria used to define ""better."" Without specific data or comparisons with other arena projects, it is difficult to definitively say whether a 50-50 split is indeed better. The claim does not provide enough evidence or context to support its assertion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of pain clinics and McDonald's in Broward County. As of my last update, there are approximately 100 McDonald's locations in Broward County. The number of pain clinics can vary, but it is generally lower than the number of fast-food restaurants. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there are more McDonald's locations than pain clinics in Broward County.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the stimulus bill containing $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers and $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs is false. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which is the stimulus bill in question, does not include provisions for these specific purposes. The bill primarily focuses on economic relief, healthcare, education, and infrastructure, but not on fish passage barriers or ATV trail rehabilitation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: John McCain, a Republican Senator, voted against the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. He was a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility and opposed the tax cuts, which he believed would increase the deficit. However, in 2017, he voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was a significant tax reform bill. Therefore, the claim that he voted against the Bush tax cuts and is now for them is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil is not accurate. While it is true that ISIS has controlled some oil fields in Libya and has sold oil to generate revenue, the extent of their control and the amount of money they generate is often exaggerated. The United Nations and other international organizations have reported that ISIS's oil revenues are significantly lower than the claimed millions of dollars per week. Additionally, the oil sales are often conducted through informal and illegal channels, making it difficult to accurately quantify their earnings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the percentage of the federal government's spending in the U.S. economy over time. In 2020, the federal government spent approximately 24.9% of the U.S. GDP, which is indeed higher than the 2% spent in 1920. However, the claim states ""25 percent"" which is slightly higher than the actual figure. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about the number of times a specific governor, Jay Nixon, has been overridden compared to all previous governors in Missouri history.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that tens of billions of dollars from taxpayer-funded bailouts flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks is misleading and not entirely accurate. While it is true that AIG received significant bailout funds from the U.S. government, the funds were used to stabilize the company and prevent a collapse that could have had severe economic consequences. A portion of these funds was used to pay off debts and obligations, including those to foreign entities. However, the claim suggests a direct and intentional flow of funds to foreign entities, which is not supported by the facts. The bailout funds were intended to stabilize AIG and the broader financial system, not to enrich foreign corporations or banks.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a famous quote by Daniel Webster, ""I am out, and I am in."" This quote is often used to describe a situation where someone has changed their mind or position. The claim is a play on this quote, suggesting that someone has changed their mind about something. However, without additional context, it's impossible to determine the specific situation or person being referred to. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a platform, and it states that it will not make any changes to the current Medicare system for current retirees and those approaching retirement.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual news.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) was indeed called a socialist and a communist by his political opponents during his time in office. These labels were used to criticize his New Deal policies, which included significant government intervention in the economy. However, FDR himself did not identify as a socialist or a communist. He was a Democrat and his policies were more accurately described as liberal or progressive.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""90 percent of that [deficit increase] is as a consequence of President George W. Bush's policies and the recession"" is not accurate. While the recession did contribute to the increase in the deficit, it is not accurate to attribute 90% of the increase to President George W. Bush's policies. The deficit increased significantly during the Bush administration, but this was also due to factors such as the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the economic stimulus packages in response to the recession. The claim oversimplifies and misattributes the cause of the deficit increase.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a particular state is the only one in the country that bypassed the General Assembly to authorize in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. This claim is false because there are multiple states that have authorized in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, and the process of authorization varies by state. Some states have done so through legislation, while others have done so through executive action or court decisions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported national poll that specifically states the majority of Americans believe we should have a gold standard for U.S. currency. While there may be polls on various economic topics, a gold standard is a niche issue that is not typically the focus of mainstream polls. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks is false. The Armed Pilots Program, also known as the Armed Guardians Program, was established by the Trump administration in 2019. It is a program that allows armed pilots to carry firearms on commercial flights to protect against potential threats. Barack Obama was not involved in the creation or funding of this program, as he was no longer in office when it was implemented. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that he is trying to slash funding for it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the nuclear arsenal of a country is ineffective due to outdated equipment is a serious allegation that requires verification. However, the claim that the equipment is 30 years old and that its effectiveness is uncertain is not supported by credible sources. Nuclear weapons systems are typically subject to rigorous testing and maintenance protocols to ensure their reliability and effectiveness. Without specific, credible sources to back up this claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Cash for Clunkers"" program, which was a U.S. government initiative to encourage the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, did not involve the government seizing personal information or tracking computer activity. The program was administered through a website, but the government did not have the capability or authority to access personal information or monitor computer activity of individuals who used the website. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the program's purpose and capabilities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the state Legislature passed more than $5 billion in tax increases in 2009 is false. According to the California State Legislature's official records, the total tax increases passed in 2009 were significantly less than $5 billion. The largest tax increase passed that year was the extension of the state's sales tax by 1/4 cent, which amounted to approximately $1.5 billion annually. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Right now we are the highest taxed country in the world"" is false. The United States is not the highest taxed country in the world. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the highest taxed country in the world is France, with a total tax-to-GDP ratio of 45.4% in 2020. The United States has a total tax-to-GDP ratio of 24.9% in 2020.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was a U.S. government program created in response to the financial crisis of 2008. The program involved the government providing funds to financial institutions in exchange for preferred stock or other securities. The goal was to stabilize the financial system and prevent further collapse. The first round of repayments from financial institutions that received TARP money did not necessarily result in a profit for the government. The government's goal was to recoup the funds and stabilize the financial system, not to make a profit. Therefore, the claim that the government turned a profit in the first round of repayments is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Border Patrol signs near the Mexico border are in English, Spanish, and Chinese is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that every governor at the midterm of their first term has lost seats in the Legislature, with the exception of Jim McGreevey in 2003.

There are exceptions to this rule, and the claim incorrectly implies that Jim McGreevey is the only exception.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific study or report from the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) regarding the impact of light rail in Cobb County on commute times and traffic congestion. However, without specific details or references to the study, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. Typically, such claims would need to be backed by empirical data and analysis from the GRTA or other reputable sources. If the claim is based on a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the study's findings, it would be false.

"Explanation: The claim that the state's rainy day fund has grown by 643 percent since Gov. Nathan Deal's office in 2011 is false. The rainy day fund is a fund that states use to save money during economic downturns. The growth of the fund is typically measured in terms of the fund's balance relative to the state's budget or other relevant metrics, not as a percentage increase. The claim of a 643 percent increase is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the fund's growth.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama built this $16 trillion debt is false. The debt level of $16 trillion was reached during the Obama administration, but it is not accurate to say that he ""built"" this debt.

However, it is not accurate to attribute the entire debt to his actions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing tax laws in the United States. However, the IRS does not have any authority over healthcare. The healthcare system in the U.S. is primarily regulated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Therefore, the claim that the IRS is going to be in charge of our healthcare is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The phrase ""endowed by their Creator"" is not found in the original text of the Declaration of Independence. The phrase ""endowed by their Creator"" was added to the Declaration of Independence by the U.S. Congress in 1952, and it was not part of the original text written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776. Therefore, no president has deliberately removed these words, as they were not originally present in the document.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's presidential victory was an electoral landslide is false. While Trump did win the presidency, the margin of victory was not a landslide. In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Trump won the electoral college vote by 304 to 227, but he did not win the popular vote. He received approximately 46.1% of the popular vote, while Hillary Clinton received approximately 48.2%. The difference in the popular vote was about 2.1 million votes, which is not considered a landslide.

Without specific data or context, it's not possible to verify the claim that the fund has grown 165 times since a specific point in time.

He co-founded a consulting firm called ""Cruz & Associates"" in 2003, which he led until 2007. He also worked as a lawyer and served as the Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2007. Therefore, he has led businesses and held professional positions before his political career.

"Explanation: The claim is attempting to put the $1 trillion economic stimulus plan into perspective by comparing it to the amount of money that would have been spent if $1 million was spent every day since the birth of Jesus Christ. To evaluate this claim, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent over that period.

Assuming Jesus Christ was born in 4 BC, the number of years since then is approximately 2021 - 4 = 2017 years. If $1 million was spent every day for 2017 years, the total amount spent would be:

2017 years * 365 days/year * $1 million/day = $730,450,000,000

This is indeed less than $1 trillion, so the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The individual in question, James Clapper, was indeed appointed by Eric Holder to investigate government leaks.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""As the Democrats finally maxed out their government spending credit card Monday"" is a metaphorical and hyperbolic way of saying that the Democrats have reached their limit on government spending. However, the claim that Kurt Schrader, a Democratic Congressman from Oregon, ""continued to stand with his party leaders in failing to offer any viable long-term solution"" is not accurate. Kurt Schrader has been vocal about his support for fiscal responsibility and has proposed various solutions to address the debt and deficit. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal deficit for the fiscal year 2021 was approximately $2.8 trillion. The average salary of a professional baseball player in 2013 was around $4 million. To calculate the total salary for all players in 2013, we would need the number of players, which is approximately 800 (400 in the MLB and 400 in the minor leagues). So, the total salary for all players in 2013 would be around $3.2 billion. The claim suggests that the deficit could pay for these salaries for 248 years, which is not accurate. The deficit is not a fixed amount that can be used to pay for salaries over a long period. It is a measure of the government's annual spending exceeding its annual revenue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Portland has won more national Constitution contests than any city in America is not verifiable with the information provided.

However, without specific details, I cannot definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

If the legislation allows for public funding or does not explicitly state that there will be no public funding, then the claim would be false.

"Explanation: The claim that there is no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant and that higher CO2 concentrations actually help ecosystems is false. While it is true that CO2 is a natural part of the Earth's atmosphere and is essential for plant growth, the claim that it is not a pollutant is misleading. CO2 is considered a pollutant because it contributes to climate change, which has significant negative impacts on ecosystems, including increased temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent and severe weather events. Higher CO2 concentrations can indeed stimulate plant growth in the short term, but the long-term effects of increased CO2 levels on ecosystems are overwhelmingly negative.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Mike Martinez, a former city councilman in San Diego, was convicted of misconduct in office and fraud. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, not avoided jail time. The $24,657.50 figure is the amount he was ordered to pay in restitution, not a legal bill. The claim misrepresents the facts of the case.

"Explanation: The claim about Guantanamo detainees receiving taxpayer-paid-for prayer rugs and having honey-glazed chicken and rice pilaf is false. The U.S. military provides religious materials to detainees, including prayer rugs, but these are not paid for by taxpayers. The claim about the food is also false, as detainees are provided with standard military rations, not honey-glazed chicken and rice pilaf.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""about 25 Texas cities and 39 states have banned texting while driving"" is false. While many states and cities have laws against texting while driving, the numbers provided are not accurate. As of my last update, Texas has a law against texting while driving, but it is not accurate to say that 25 Texas cities have banned it. Additionally, the number of states with such bans is more than 39, but the exact number can vary depending on the specific laws and their enforcement.

"Explanation: The claim states that Floridians have sent $3 billion less of their funding for the new state budget.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that the Bush tax cuts created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years they were in existence is a simplification of a complex economic issue. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) has conducted studies that suggest the Bush tax cuts did not create a significant number of jobs. Instead, they argue that the tax cuts primarily benefited the wealthy and did not stimulate job growth. Additionally, the claim that 5 million jobs were lost during the recession is accurate, but it does not directly relate to the impact of the Bush tax cuts. The recession was caused by a variety of factors, including the housing market collapse and the financial crisis.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the swearing-in process for a Massachusetts official was delayed to allow for the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim. The ACA was passed in 2010, and the swearing-in process for Massachusetts officials would not have been directly affected by its passage. The claim appears to be a conspiracy theory without factual basis.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Saudi Arabia is the only country in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) where women cannot get licenses to drive, there are other Muslim-majority countries where women also face restrictions on driving. For example, in Yemen, women are not allowed to drive in certain areas, and in some parts of Afghanistan, women are not allowed to drive at all. Therefore, the claim that Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim country where women cannot get licenses to drive is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that federal employees' benefits and wages far outstrip the market rates of the private sector is a complex issue that depends on various factors. While it is true that federal employees often receive certain benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and job security, these benefits are not always directly comparable to private sector wages. Additionally, federal employees' wages are often lower than those in the private sector for similar positions. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) which estimated that ending the direct payment farm subsidy program could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years. The CBO's report is a credible source, and the claim accurately reflects the findings of the report. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"

"Explanation: The claim is false. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt is approximately $28 trillion, while the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is around $23 trillion. While the debt is significant, it does not yet exceed the size of the national economy.

Additionally, he worked on issues like the economic recovery after the 2008 financial crisis and the Iran nuclear deal, both of which involved bipartisan cooperation.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not suggest that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. In fact, Romney has been a strong advocate for women's health and has supported access to contraception. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his views.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The Republican Party platform has historically advocated for less regulation on campaign finance, including the repeal of the McCain-Feingold Act, which was a significant piece of campaign finance reform legislation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that DeKalb County has cut more money from its general fund budget than any local government in the Atlanta metro region is difficult to verify without specific data and context. Budget cuts can vary greatly depending on the fiscal year, the specific programs or services being cut, and the overall economic conditions. Without concrete evidence or a comparison with other local governments in the Atlanta metro region, it is not possible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rubio's tax swap proposal ""would have been a massive tax increase"" is false. Rubio's proposal, which was part of his 2016 presidential campaign, aimed to reduce the corporate tax rate and offset the revenue loss by closing loopholes and eliminating certain tax credits. While some aspects of the proposal could have led to increased taxes for certain individuals or businesses, the overall goal was to simplify the tax code and reduce the overall tax burden. Therefore, the claim that it would have been a ""massive tax increase"" is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that mayors have the power to block water treatment plants that are intended to treat cryptosporidium, even if a company like CH2M Hill wants to build them. This is a false claim because mayors do not have the authority to block such projects based on their personal beliefs or the desires of a company. The decision to build water treatment plants is typically made by local or state authorities based on public health needs and regulatory requirements.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida was No. 1 in violent crime in America in the mid-1990s is false. According to FBI crime statistics, in 1995, Florida ranked 10th in the nation for violent crime rates. The claim that citizens of Florida were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds is also incorrect. The actual rate of violent crimes per capita in Florida in 1995 was much lower than the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker's listening sessions are invite-only and excluding the press is false. Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, has held public listening sessions where he has invited the public to attend and participate. These sessions are open to the public and are not restricted to invite-only attendees. Therefore, the claim that the press is excluded is also false, as the press is typically allowed to attend and report on these events.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that right-to-work states are creating more jobs than heavily unionized states is a complex issue that depends on various factors. Studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of right-to-work laws on job creation. Some studies suggest that right-to-work laws can lead to increased job growth, while others find no significant difference or even a negative impact. The job creation rate can also be influenced by other factors such as economic conditions, industry trends, and government policies. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that right-to-work states are consistently creating more jobs than heavily unionized states.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the leader of ISIS was imprisoned by American troops and ordered released to Iraq by the Obama administration in 2009 is false. The leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was not imprisoned by American troops. He was captured in 2014 and killed by American forces in 2019. The claim about his imprisonment and release in 2009 is a misinterpretation of events and is not supported by credible sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Del. Ben Chafin did not take money away from Southwest Virginia schools. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and voted on various bills, including those related to education funding. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he personally took money away from schools or voted to build a politician's palace. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of his actions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that spending of government money is 17 percent less than it was a decade ago is not accurate. Government spending can vary significantly from year to year due to various factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and emergencies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin state budget proposal does not include a provision that would cause state employees' income to disappear overnight.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: North Korea is known to have a large standing army, but the claim that it has the largest per capita is not accurate. While North Korea has one of the largest armies in terms of total numbers, when considering the population, other countries like Israel and Singapore have larger armies per capita. Therefore, the claim that North Korea has the largest army per capita is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that an Iranian woman risks being beaten or killed for showing too much hair in public is a misrepresentation of the reality in Iran. While there are strict dress codes and laws regarding public behavior in Iran, the claim is an exaggeration and not based on accurate information. The Iranian government enforces laws that require women to wear the hijab, but these laws do not extend to the extent of physical violence or death for showing hair. The claim is likely a result of misinformation or sensationalism.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop"" by political opponents.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has not publicly stated that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. While she has expressed support for certain gun control measures, such as universal background checks and closing loopholes in the current system, she has not advocated for the complete abolition of the Second Amendment. Therefore, the claim that she wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the salaries of top officials at the Port Authority with the salaries of governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them. The Port Authority is a bi-state agency that serves New York and New Jersey, and its top officials are not directly comparable to governors of these states. Governors are elected officials with salaries set by their respective state legislatures, while top officials at the Port Authority are appointed and their salaries are set by the Port Authority's board of directors. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true. In the 1980s, the Democratic administration of President Jimmy Carter did propose spending cuts, but the subsequent administration of President Ronald Reagan implemented significant tax cuts. Therefore, the claim that Democrats delivered only tax hikes is not accurate, as they did not deliver any tax hikes during their time in office.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved is not accurate. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the clearance rate for murders in St. Louis has been fluctuating but has generally been above 50% in recent years. For instance, in 2019, the clearance rate was 60.5%, and in 2020, it was 59.3%. Therefore, the claim that only half of the murders are solved is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The legislation in question is the USA PATRIOT Act, which Senator John McCain supported. This act does not provide the authority for the federal government to surveil American citizens without any suspicion of terrorist activity or criminal behavior.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker received a $7,300 pay raise is false. According to the Wisconsin State Legislature's website, the governor's salary is set by law and does not change unless the legislature votes to increase it. As of my last update, Gov. Walker's salary was $159,000 per year, and there is no evidence of a $7,300 increase.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, Tennessee does not have a state sales tax on groceries. However, there are local sales taxes that vary by county. Therefore, the claim that Tennessee's grocery tax is one of the highest in the nation is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 48% and 49% of President Barack Obama's supporters are people who pay no income tax is a misinterpretation of a statement made by Mitt Romney during the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Romney's statement was based on a report from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that showed 47% of Americans did not pay federal income taxes in 2011. However, this does not mean that 48% or 49% of Obama's supporters are non-taxpayers. The claim is false because it misrepresents the data and implies a direct correlation between political support and tax status that is not supported by the facts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not send a much larger force to deal with Ebola than ISIS. In fact, the U.S. response to Ebola in West Africa was primarily focused on medical and humanitarian efforts, rather than a military response. The U.S. military was involved in providing logistical support and medical care, but the number of troops deployed was not significantly larger than those involved in the fight against ISIS.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Harry Reid, the former U.S. Senate Majority Leader, did not make any public statements regarding whether Senate Democrats would seat Roland Burris. Burris was appointed to the Senate by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich after the resignation of Barack Obama, who was elected President of the United States. The appointment was controversial, and Burris was eventually seated by the Senate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States is not number one in the world in energy resources. Russia is indeed a major energy producer, but it is not number two in the world. The United States is the world's largest producer of natural gas and the second-largest producer of oil. However, when considering total energy resources, including coal, oil, and natural gas, Russia is the largest producer, followed by the United States.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to the United States by 550 percent is false. Hillary Clinton did not propose such a policy during her 2016 presidential campaign. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a deliberate distortion of her stance on refugee policy. Clinton's proposed plan was to accept a higher number of refugees, but not to a degree that would increase the number by 550 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: To evaluate the claim ""We are at a 40-year low in our crime rate in our state,"" I would need to check the latest crime statistics for the state in question.

Answer: 0/1 (I cannot determine the truth of the claim without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim about New Jersey's tenure law being reformed to state that teachers lose tenure after two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings is false. New Jersey's tenure law, as of my last update, does not include such a provision. Teachers in New Jersey typically lose tenure after three consecutive years of ineffective ratings, not two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by James Hansen, a prominent climate scientist. Hansen has indeed warned about the potential for significant sea-level rise due to climate change. However, the specific numbers mentioned in the claim (50 years, 10, 20, 30 feet of sea-level rise) are not accurate representations of Hansen's statements. Hansen has stated that sea levels could rise by several meters over the next century, but the exact figures and timeframes mentioned in the claim are not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that more people are losing their insurance than are becoming newly insured due to Obamacare is not accurate. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to increase the number of people with health insurance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the uninsured rate in the United States has been declining since the implementation of the ACA. In 2010, the uninsured rate was 16.0%, and by 2019, it had dropped to 8.9%. This indicates that more people have gained insurance coverage than have lost it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the current numbers (which are not specified) to Ronald Reagan's numbers during his presidency. Without specific data points or context, it's impossible to verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is referring to polling numbers or approval ratings, it would be necessary to compare the current numbers to Reagan's approval ratings during his presidency with Jimmy Carter as the previous president. Without this specific data, the claim cannot be accurately evaluated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the president referred to the Syrian opposition as ""pharmacists and doctors"" is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the racial and ethnic makeup of the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office mirrors the community it serves is not necessarily true. While it is important for law enforcement to reflect the diversity of the community they serve, the actual makeup of the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office may not perfectly mirror the community's demographics. This is due to various factors such as recruitment processes, hiring practices, and the overall diversity of the applicant pool.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that state legislators and Congress have the authority to decriminalize marijuana, local governments, including cities, also have the power to implement their own policies regarding marijuana. Clarkston, like many other cities, can indeed decriminalize marijuana through local ordinances, even if the state or federal laws do not allow it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a Democratic poll operation shows that Fox News is the most trusted news operation in the country is false. Polls conducted by Democratic organizations typically reflect the views of their supporters and may not be representative of the entire population. Additionally, there is no specific poll from a Democratic organization that supports this claim. Fox News is often criticized for its conservative bias, and polls from various sources often show that it is not the most trusted news operation among all Americans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Rob Portman, a former U.S. Senator and current U.S. Trade Representative, has been involved in trade negotiations and policies, including those related to China. However, the claim that he ""failed, looked the other way, did nothing"" regarding China's illegal dumping of steel is not accurate. Portman has been actively involved in trade negotiations and has taken actions to address trade issues, including those related to steel dumping. The claim oversimplifies and misrepresents his role and actions.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070 is based on projections from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The FAO has estimated that global food demand will increase by about 50% by 2050, and this projection is widely accepted by experts in the field. However, the claim specifies ""double"" which is an exaggeration of the actual projection. Therefore, while the demand for food will increase significantly, it will not double.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that every major study shows hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created by passing cap-and-trade legislation is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. While some studies have shown that cap-and-trade policies can create jobs in certain sectors, such as renewable energy, the overall impact on job creation is more nuanced and varies depending on the specific policies and economic conditions. Additionally, the claim that ""if you wind up pricing carbon"" is a bit ambiguous and could be interpreted differently depending on the context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the acceptance of gay marriage or civil unions in the country. However, it does not provide specific data or sources to support the claim. As of my last update in October 2023, the acceptance of gay marriage and civil unions varies by state and country, and a precise figure of 40% is not universally accepted or supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information indicating that the president of the United States is advocating for a drone strike program specifically in America. Drone strikes are typically used in overseas operations, and any domestic use would require significant legal and political justification. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: There have been several investigations and reports about Donald Trump's business dealings, including allegations of ties to organized crime figures. However, these allegations have not been substantiated with concrete evidence. The most notable case is the Trump Tower meeting in 2016, where Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with a Russian lawyer who was said to have information that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton. While this meeting was reported, it did not involve direct ties to the mafia or mob. Therefore, the claim that there have been multiple media reports about Donald Trump's business dealings with the mob or mafia is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Austin Independent School District's graduation rate reached an all-time high of 82.5 percent in 2012 is false. The Austin Independent School District's graduation rate for the 2011-2012 school year was 81.5 percent, not 82.5 percent. This information can be verified through the Texas Education Agency's website, which provides annual graduation rates for school districts in Texas.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Senate Republicans have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee in the last five years is false. While Republicans have used the filibuster more frequently in recent years, it is not accurate to say that they have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee. The filibuster is a procedural tool used to delay or prevent a vote on a bill or nomination, and it is not used on every piece of legislation or every nominee. Additionally, the filibuster can be invoked by any senator, not just Republicans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Chris Christie's budget cuts did not lead to the closure of six of the state's 58 family planning centers.

"Explanation: The claim that the average Emergency Room (ER) wait in California is 5 hours due to the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is misleading. While the Affordable Care Act has had an impact on healthcare access and costs, it has not directly caused a significant increase in ER wait times. In fact, studies have shown that the Affordable Care Act has led to an increase in primary care visits, which can help reduce ER congestion. Additionally, the average ER wait time in California is typically around 2-3 hours, not 5 hours. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that it is rare for a retirement grade determination to be conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Balanced Budget Amendment was never close to passing Congress. It was introduced in 1995 and 1997, but it never came within one vote of passing. Additionally, Rick Santorum did not call for a top Senate Republican to resign his chairmanship. Santorum was a senator from Pennsylvania and was not involved in the Balanced Budget Amendment process in the way described in the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that California's Capitol building is second only to Disneyland among visitor sites in the state is false. While the California State Capitol is a significant and popular tourist attraction, Disneyland is far more visited.

Therefore, Disneyland is the most visited site in California, not the California State Capitol.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on projections and estimates, which can change over time. The interest payments on the national debt and defense spending are both subject to various factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and budgetary decisions.

"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs is a complex issue that requires a nuanced analysis. Walker's policies, such as the repeal of collective bargaining rights for public employees and the implementation of various business-friendly regulations, have been criticized for potentially leading to job losses. However, attributing a specific number of job losses to Walker's actions is challenging due to the multitude of factors that influence job markets, including economic trends, industry-specific issues, and broader national and global economic conditions.

"Explanation: The claim that House Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks is false. David Obey's partial earmark ban, which was implemented in 2007, aimed to reduce the influence of lawmakers in the appropriations process by limiting the use of earmarks. However, the ban did not apply to all earmarks, but it significantly reduced their number and influence. The claim that it wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks is an exaggeration and not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that 95% of climate scientists agree that humans are the primary cause of global warming. Surveys of climate scientists, such as those conducted by John Cook and others, have consistently shown that the vast majority of climate scientists (over 97%) agree that humans are the primary cause of global warming. The claim that 57% of climate scientists do not agree with this idea is not supported by scientific consensus or surveys.

"Explanation: Ken Buck, a Republican congressman from Colorado, has indeed expressed his opposition to abortion, including in cases of rape or incest. However, he has not explicitly stated that he wants to ""outlaw"" abortion in these specific cases. His stance is more about limiting access to abortion rather than completely banning it. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about Mayor Kenney's stance on the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) and his position on city employees utilizing this benefit. The claim states that Mayor Kenney personally does not support DROP but acknowledges that highly qualified city employees can appropriately utilize the benefit.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Scott Walker, who served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, did implement significant cuts to education funding during his tenure. However, the claim that these were the ""biggest cuts in our state's history"" is subjective and depends on the specific time frame and context. While Walker's cuts were substantial, it is difficult to definitively say they were the largest in Wisconsin's history without comparing them to other periods of significant cuts.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a remark made by a speaker at an AFSCME forum in 2007. While it is true that there are jobs in fields like auto mechanics and airline mechanics that can be well-paying, the claim that 60% of kids are not going to college and that these jobs are unfilled is not supported by current data. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021, about 68% of high school graduates were enrolled in postsecondary education, and the unemployment rate for high school graduates was around 6.5%. Additionally, the claim that these jobs are unfilled is not accurate as there are often more job seekers than available positions in these fields.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""I am every year the No.1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas"" is highly unlikely to be true. Law enforcement agencies typically have specific criteria and processes for hiring, and it is not common for an individual to be the top pick every year across all agencies. Additionally, there is no public record or widely recognized source that supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States"" is false. While it is true that the United States has not had a widespread outbreak of Ebola, there have been cases of Ebola in the United States. For example, in 2014, two healthcare workers in Texas were infected with Ebola after treating a patient who had traveled from West Africa. Additionally, in 2015, a nurse in New Jersey was infected with Ebola after treating a patient who had traveled from West Africa. Therefore, the claim that there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the cost of two days of interest paid to China with the cost of one joint strike fighter (jet). The interest paid to China is a result of the U.S. government's borrowing from China, which is a complex financial transaction. The cost of a joint strike fighter is a significant military expenditure. The claim is comparing two unrelated financial concepts, making it difficult to directly equate them. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that our larger domestic threat is from racial supremacist groups is a complex issue that depends on various factors such as the definition of ""larger"" and the specific context of the threat. While it is true that racial supremacist groups pose a significant threat to public safety and societal harmony, it is also important to consider other domestic threats such as extremist groups, political violence, and cyber threats. Therefore, the claim is not universally true as it simplifies the issue and does not account for other potential threats.

In 2016, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charged Mannatech with making false and misleading claims about its products. The company's founder, Samuel E. Lee, was also named in the lawsuit, which alleged that he had made false claims about the health benefits of Mannatech's products. The lawsuit was settled in 2017, with Mannatech agreeing to pay $22 million in damages and Lee agreeing to pay $10 million. Therefore, the claim that the person did not have an involvement with Mannatech is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not say that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. The negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, and Germany) were focused on Iran's nuclear program, but the approach was to reach a comprehensive agreement that would limit Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, not the dismantling of the sanctions in exchange for dismantling the nuclear program.

"Explanation: The claim that public employees receive something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, the total number of public employees in Rhode Island was approximately 30,000, while the total number of private sector employees was around 350,000. This indicates that public employees make up a smaller percentage of the workforce in Rhode Island, not 25 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Iran Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was designed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The agreement included strict inspections and limitations on Iran's nuclear activities. While Iran has been accused of violating the deal in certain aspects, such as its ballistic missile program, the deal itself was intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the claim that the Iran Deal will facilitate and accelerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is false.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Scott Walker's administration did not reduce the state investment in kindergarten education. In fact, during his tenure, Wisconsin increased funding for early childhood education programs. The state's investment in kindergarten and other early education programs has been maintained and even increased in some areas. Therefore, the claim that a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in their education as those that came before them until they are graduating from high school is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you can make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher in Georgia compared to other states is not accurate. Salaries for teachers can vary significantly based on factors such as experience, education, and the specific school district. While some states may offer higher salaries, Georgia's average teacher salary is not significantly higher than the national average. According to the National Education Association, the average salary for a public school teacher in Georgia in the 2020-2021 school year was around $58,000, which is slightly above the national average of $61,320. Therefore, the claim that you can make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher in Georgia is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, there are seven tax brackets for the 2021 tax year, not ten. The top tax bracket for single filers in 2021 is for income over $523,600, not $9,000. Therefore, someone making $9,000 would be in the 10% tax bracket, not the top bracket.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that American manufacturers are creating new jobs for the first time since 1990 is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the manufacturing sector has been adding jobs consistently since the 2010s.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing household income changes over different periods and under different political figures. The statement about Mitt Romney's time as governor of Massachusetts is not directly comparable to the current national trend.

Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and lacks context to be considered true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has never voted for raising taxes"" is a statement about a person's voting record.

"Explanation: John McCain's health care plan, which was proposed during his 2008 presidential campaign, did not include a specific guarantee for coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care. His plan focused more on expanding health insurance options and reducing costs, but it did not explicitly address these specific services. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Dick Cheney supported gay marriage sooner than Hillary Clinton is false. Dick Cheney was a prominent opponent of same-sex marriage throughout his political career. He was a vocal critic of the legalization of same-sex marriage and supported the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has evolved on the issue of same-sex marriage. She initially opposed it but later became a strong supporter. Therefore, the claim that Cheney supported it sooner than Clinton is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of metro Atlanta is bigger than 28 states in the union is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the GDP of metro Atlanta (which includes the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metropolitan statistical area) was approximately $370 billion in 2020. While this is a significant figure, it is not larger than the GDP of 28 states. For example, the GDP of California alone was over $2.7 trillion in 2020, which is much larger than the GDP of metro Atlanta.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Charlie Crist, who served as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011, did not oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006. In fact, he supported the Dream Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Therefore, the claim that he opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006 is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown voted to cut Medicare by over $500 billion in order to fund government-run health care is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about the cost of health coverage in Florida's program. The statement ""usually it's about $900 a month to get health coverage"" is not accurate as it does not provide specific details about the program or the cost structure.

Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the vaccine to prevent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) can cause mental retardation is false. There is no scientific evidence to support this claim. The HPV vaccine is safe and effective in preventing HPV infections, which can lead to certain types of cancer. The vaccine does not cause mental retardation or any other serious side effects. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the vaccine's side effects, which are generally mild and temporary, such as pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama opposed a bill that would have saved Gianna Jessen's life is false. Gianna Jessen is a woman who was born in 1991 and survived a failed abortion attempt. The claim that Obama opposed a bill to save her life is a misinterpretation of events. Obama was not involved in the specific legislation or events surrounding Gianna Jessen's birth and survival. The claim is a part of a broader conspiracy theory that has been debunked by fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States is undertaxed compared to its competitors is a complex issue that depends on various factors such as the type of taxes, the tax rates, and the overall tax burden. The U.S. has a relatively low corporate tax rate compared to many other developed countries, but it also has a high effective tax rate due to various deductions and credits. Additionally, the U.S. has a progressive income tax system, which means that higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the U.S. is undertaxed compared to its competitors without considering these nuances.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the elections proposal would allow a potential of 168 hours (of early voting), which is the most we've ever had.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: According to the IRS, in 2019, about 44% of Americans did not pay any federal income tax. This is because they either earned less than the standard deduction ($12,550 for a single filer in 2019) or had enough tax credits to offset their tax liability. Therefore, the claim that ""half the Americans don't pay any income taxes"" is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech, including hate speech. However, there are exceptions to this protection, such as when speech incites imminent lawless action or is considered ""fighting words."" Therefore, while hate speech is generally protected, it is not entirely excluded from protection under the First Amendment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the top 1 percent of income-earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government is generally accurate. According to data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various studies, the top 1 percent of income-earners in the United States do indeed contribute a significant portion of federal taxes. For instance, in 2018, the top 1 percent of earners paid approximately 40 percent of all federal income taxes.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of data: deaths from tainted food in the United States and deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), foodborne illnesses cause an estimated 48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths in the United States each year. On the other hand, as of 2021, the total number of U.S. military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began is approximately 7,000. Therefore, the claim that more people were killed in the United States last year by tainted food than U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Marco Rubio requested 37 earmarks worth $43 million in 2002. However, this information is not accurate. Marco Rubio was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, not in 2002. Therefore, he could not have requested earmarks in 2002.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The CARES Act, which is the economic stimulus plan referenced, does not contain any provisions that prohibit students from meeting together in their dorms for religious activities such as prayer groups or Bible studies. The CARES Act primarily focuses on providing financial relief to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it does not impose restrictions on religious gatherings in dormitories.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration notified Poland and the Czech Republic about the cancellation of major missile-defense facilities ""at the last minute in midnight phone calls"" is false. The U.S. missile defense system in Europe, known as the European Phased Adaptive Defense (EPAA), was not canceled by the Obama administration. The system was scaled back in 2013, but this was a planned and gradual process, not a sudden cancellation. The claim of midnight phone calls is also not supported by any credible sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a million people could get health insurance right away if Texas expanded Medicaid under Obamacare is based on a misunderstanding of how Medicaid expansion works. Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) would indeed provide health insurance to many more people in Texas, but the number of people who could get health insurance immediately would depend on various factors, including the state's implementation plan, existing healthcare infrastructure, and the number of people who are eligible but not currently enrolled. The claim of ""a million people"" is an oversimplification and not a precise estimate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Mark Kirk, a former U.S. Senator from Illinois, has not called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that he was fine with Trump's call for mass deportation. These claims are likely misinformation or misattribution.

Buffett made this statement in 2002, expressing his concern about the potential risks and systemic impact of CDS. However, the claim that Greene was the first individual to use them is false. CDS have been used by various financial institutions and individuals for decades before the 2008 financial crisis.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have specific data on the murder rate in Atlanta for the current year. However, I can provide some context. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the murder rate in Atlanta has been fluctuating over the years, with no clear trend indicating a significant rise in 2023. Without specific data for 2023, it's challenging to definitively say whether the murder rate is on the rise.

"Explanation: The claim that George Allencast was the deciding vote for the 2003 Bush tax cuts is false. George Allencast is not a well-known figure in U.S. politics, and there is no evidence to suggest that he played a role in the 2003 Bush tax cuts. The 2003 tax cuts were passed with bipartisan support, and the deciding votes were cast by members of Congress, not by a figure named George Allencast.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s is a simplification of a complex historical process. While it is true that the Nazi regime implemented policies to disarm and control the German population, the process was gradual and involved various measures, including the registration of firearms, the creation of a national registry, and the eventual prohibition of private ownership of firearms. However, the claim that this disarmament allowed the Nazis to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance is an oversimplification. The Nazi regime's ability to carry out its atrocities was due to a combination of factors, including the regime's control over the police and military, the use of propaganda and terror, and the complicity of many Germans. The disarmament of the German population was one factor among many that contributed to the regime's ability to carry out its evil intentions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was enacted, Florida parents could indeed purchase child-only coverage for their children. However, the ACA did not eliminate this choice; instead, it expanded access to affordable health insurance for children and adults alike. The ACA's consumer protections, such as the requirement for insurers to cover pre-existing conditions and the expansion of Medicaid, have actually increased the availability of affordable health insurance options for Florida residents.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Medicaid expansion funding is primarily sourced from the federal government, not from foreign countries like China. The federal government provides the majority of the funding for Medicaid programs, with states contributing a smaller portion. The claim that 46 cents of every dollar for Medicaid expansion is coming from China or another country that doesn't like the U.S. is a misrepresentation of the funding sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Congressman Nye did not vote against a bill that would have defunded the IRS. The IRS is not involved in implementing health care legislation. The IRS is responsible for tax collection and administration, not health care. Therefore, there is no bill that would have defunded the IRS for health care legislation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Greece has a GDP the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is false. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex has a GDP of approximately $400 billion, while Greece's GDP is around $240 billion. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Trey Radel, a former Republican congressman from Florida, did not have a driving license revoked or any other legal issue that would prevent him from driving a school bus.

"Explanation: The claim that Muslims have been in America since George Washington is false. While there is evidence of Muslims in America before the 20th century, the first significant Muslim presence in the United States began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily with immigrants from the Middle East and South Asia. The first Muslim community in the United States was established in 1893 in Dearborn, Michigan, by immigrants from Lebanon. Therefore, the claim that Muslims have been in America since George Washington is an exaggeration and not historically accurate.

Dan Sullivan served as Alaska's Attorney General from 2014 to 2018, but he did not pass any ""stand your ground"" legislation. The ""stand your ground"" law was already in place in Alaska before his tenure. Additionally, while Sullivan has been a vocal supporter of the Second Amendment, his actions as Attorney General did not involve passing new legislation to protect Second Amendment rights.

"Explanation: The claim that Texas is the second state in the nation for new gun purchases, behind California, is false. According to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data, California has consistently been the top state for firearm background checks, which are often used as a proxy for gun purchases. Texas is typically ranked higher than California in terms of total firearm background checks, but not in the context of new gun purchases specifically.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate in the United States has been declining since 2010, and the poverty rate in 2020 was 9.1%, compared to 12.7% in 2000. Additionally, the claim that productivity has risen 18 percent is not accurate.

According to Gallup polls, Obama's approval rating after seven months in office was around 60%, while Ford's was around 40% and Clinton's was around 50%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a misinterpretation of Barack Obama's health care proposal. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama stated that ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" However, this statement was later clarified by the Obama administration to mean that people could keep their existing plans if they chose to do so, but the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would also provide new options for those who did not have coverage or whose plans were inadequate. The claim that people could keep their plans without any changes is a simplification and a misrepresentation of the actual policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true. The major immigration issue in the UK has indeed involved Poles, Bulgarians, and Romanians, among other EU countries. However, the claim that they were not contributing economically is a generalization and not entirely accurate. Many of these immigrants have contributed significantly to the UK economy through their work and taxes. Additionally, the unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is indeed lower than the unemployment rate among Brits, according to various studies and data from the UK Office for National Statistics.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has had a mixed impact on healthcare costs, quality, and access. While the law has expanded access to healthcare for many Americans, it has also led to increased premiums for some individuals and businesses. Additionally, the quality of care can vary widely depending on factors such as location, provider, and insurance plan. Therefore, the claim that ""everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access"" is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Trump's Health Secretary Pick wants a Medicare phaseout by summer 2017 is false. The Health Secretary Pick in question is Tom Price, who was appointed by Trump in 2017.

The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his views.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that health insurance companies deny 1 out of 5 treatments prescribed by doctors is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. While it is true that insurance companies may deny or limit coverage for certain treatments, the rate of denial is not as high as 20%. According to various studies and reports, the denial rate varies but is generally lower. For example, a study by the Health Care Cost Institute found that the denial rate for medical services was around 10% in 2019. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States is no longer the top nation in the globe on infrastructure and has fallen to 15th is based on a report from the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2019. The report ranked the United States 13th in infrastructure quality, which is not the same as being the top nation globally. The claim is therefore misleading as it suggests a more significant drop in ranking than what the report actually indicates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States does not trade as much as other developed nations is not accurate. The United States is one of the largest trading nations in the world. According to the World Bank, the United States had a total trade value of $4.2 trillion in 2020, which is higher than many other developed nations. For example, Germany had a total trade value of $3.7 trillion, and Japan had $2.1 trillion. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Ted Cruz served as the Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008. However, the claim that he was the ""longest-serving solicitor general in the history of Texas"" is false because there have been other individuals who have served in this position for longer periods. For example, Ken Paxton, who is currently the Attorney General of Texas, served as the Solicitor General from 2008 to 2011, which is a longer tenure than Ted Cruz's.

"Explanation: The claim that the McCain campaign ""did not elaborate"" on Obama's ties to ACORN is false. In fact, the McCain campaign and other Republican figures did extensively discuss and allege ties between Barack Obama and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). These allegations were a significant part of the 2008 presidential campaign, with McCain and others accusing ACORN of voter fraud and suggesting that Obama had some form of association with the organization. The claim that the McCain campaign did not elaborate on this issue is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the House health care bill. The ""public option"" refers to a government-run health insurance plan that would compete with private insurance companies.

Therefore, the claim is false.

However, the current price of $2.30 per gallon is not accurate. As of my last update in October 2023, the average price of regular gasoline in the United States is around $3.50 per gallon.

The Milwaukee Police Department has seized around 1,000 firearms in 2022, while the New York City Police Department has seized over 10,000 firearms in the same period. Therefore, the claim that Milwaukee has seized nearly as many firearms as New York City is inaccurate.

"Explanation: Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1989 to 2017, has been criticized for her stance on veterans' issues, including the VA backlog. However, it is important to note that her voting record on this issue is complex and nuanced. While she has voted against some measures aimed at fixing the VA backlog, she has also supported other initiatives to improve veterans' care. Therefore, the claim that she has a ""long record of voting against VA backlog fixes"" is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. does not have a law that commits it to spending 0.7 percent of its gross national product (GNP) on foreign aid. The U.S. does contribute to foreign aid, but the percentage of GNP spent on foreign aid varies and is not fixed at 0.7 percent. The U.S. is one of the largest contributors to foreign aid, but it does not have a specific law mandating a 0.7 percent commitment.

"Explanation: The claim that there has been a substantial increase in federal government jobs under President Obama is true. According to data from the Office of Personnel Management, the number of federal employees increased from approximately 2.1 million in 2009 to about 2.7 million in 2016, which is a significant increase.

Therefore, the claim that the Ukraine Orange Revolution in 2004 was the first color revolution is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the health bill's plan for comparative effectiveness research would be used by the government to ration care is a misinterpretation of the purpose of such research. Comparative effectiveness research aims to compare the effectiveness of different treatments, not to ration care. The goal is to provide evidence-based information to help patients and healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment options. The idea of rationing care is not a part of the research's intended use.

The actual increase in wages is not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about new carbon regulations increasing electric bills by $17 billion every year and potentially putting an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year is not supported by credible sources. The figures provided are not backed by any reputable studies or official reports. Additionally, the impact of carbon regulations on electric bills and employment is complex and depends on various factors, including the specific regulations, the efficiency of the energy sector, and the economic conditions. Therefore, the claim is likely to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual impact.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Qataris don't really work"" is a generalization and stereotype that is not accurate. Qatar, like many other countries, has a diverse workforce that includes both Qataris and expatriates.

The country has been investing in education and workforce development to ensure its citizens are well-equipped to contribute to the economy. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is no significant difference between Donald Trump's immigration policies and those of Congressman Joe Heck. However, this is a simplification and an oversimplification. While both Trump and Heck are Republicans and share some common views on immigration, there are notable differences. For instance, Trump's immigration policies have been more restrictive and controversial, including the construction of a border wall, the travel ban, and the separation of families at the border. Heck, while also a Republican, has been more moderate on immigration issues. Therefore, the claim that there is no policy difference between Trump and Heck is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that property insurance rates are going up because Rick Scott signed a bill preventing the state from regulating insurance is not accurate. While it is true that Rick Scott signed a bill that limited the state's ability to regulate insurance rates, the increase in property insurance rates is primarily due to factors such as increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, higher construction costs, and other market-driven factors. The bill itself does not directly cause the increase in rates.

Popularity can be measured in various ways, such as approval ratings, media coverage, or public opinion polls. While Governor Palin has been a prominent figure in American politics, her popularity has varied over time and is not consistently the highest among all governors. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that she is the most popular governor in the country.

It was adopted as the state motto in 1945, and it reflects the state's historical commitment to individual liberties and independence.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Economic Development Commission Executive Director Keith Stokes sent a letter stating that taxpayers will never be on the hook for the bonds of 38 Studios is false. There is no evidence or official statement from Keith Stokes or the Economic Development Commission that supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by Bill McCollum, a former U.S. Representative from Florida. The statement ""You can't do everything"" is a general statement that does not specifically address mortgage fraud or any other particular issue. It is a common phrase used to acknowledge the limitations of one's abilities or resources. Therefore, the claim is true as it accurately represents a statement made by Bill McCollum.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was indeed created by Congress in 1969, but it was not intended to affect only 155 wealthy Americans. The AMT was designed to ensure that high-income individuals paid at least a minimum amount of tax, regardless of deductions and credits. Over time, due to inflation and changes in tax laws, the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has increased. However, the claim that it was originally intended to affect only 155 taxpayers and that this number has increased to 3.5 million by 2006 is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Russia and China have active human spaceflight programs, there are other nations that also have this capability. For example, the European Space Agency (ESA) has the capability to launch humans into space through its cooperation with the International Space Station (ISS). Additionally, private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have plans to launch humans into space, and SpaceX has already done so with its Crew Dragon spacecraft. Therefore, the claim that Russia and China will be the only nations with this capability is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that someone couldn't take stimulus money because it required ""universal building codes"" is false. The stimulus money, such as the Economic Impact Payments (EIP) provided by the U.S. government, is not contingent on meeting universal building codes.

"Explanation: The Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), does not entirely trust Iran to inspect itself. The deal includes provisions for international inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify Iran's compliance with the agreement. The IAEA has the authority to inspect Iran's nuclear facilities and monitor its nuclear activities. Therefore, the claim that the Iran deal trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that efforts to remove special diversity status from airport contractors have no impact on the contracts or the city's diversity goals. This claim is false because removing special diversity status typically means that the contractors are no longer given preferential treatment in bidding processes or contract awards. This change can indeed affect the contracts and the city's diversity goals, as it may lead to different contractors being selected based on merit rather than diversity considerations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of women killed by their husbands or boyfriends since September 11, 2001, to the number of Americans killed in the 9/11 attacks and in Afghanistan and Iraq. The claim is false because it is not possible to accurately compare these two figures. The number of women killed by their partners is a statistic that is tracked by various organizations and law enforcement agencies, but it is not a direct comparison to the number of Americans killed in specific conflicts. The number of Americans killed in 9/11 and in Afghanistan and Iraq is a well-documented figure, but it is not comparable to the number of women killed by their partners.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that some Muslim-majority countries have restrictions on the construction of churches and synagogues, it is not accurate to say that this is a universal rule in all Muslim countries. For instance, in countries like Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population, churches and synagogues are allowed and can be found. Similarly, in countries like Turkey, there are churches and synagogues, although their numbers and visibility may vary. The claim also oversimplifies the complex legal and social landscapes of these countries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that award-winning Milwaukee Public Schools teacher Megan Sampson was laid off because Gov. Scott Walker cut state aid to education is false. While it is true that Gov. Scott Walker implemented budget cuts to education during his tenure, there is no evidence to suggest that Megan Sampson was specifically laid off due to these cuts. The claim is a misattribution of the cause of Sampson's layoff.

"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama said ""when we got bin Laden, terrorism problem solved"" is a misquote. The actual quote from President Obama was ""We have taken a significant step forward in our efforts to protect the American people and to disrupt the terrorist network that attacked us on 9/11."" This statement was made in a press conference after the death of Osama bin Laden, but it did not claim that terrorism was solved. The claim is therefore false.

The claim of having more than 54,000 students is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) which found that black and Hispanic applicants were more likely to be denied a mortgage than white applicants with similar credentials. The study found that black applicants were 2.5 times more likely to be denied a mortgage than white applicants, and Hispanic applicants were 1.5 times more likely to be denied a mortgage than white applicants. Therefore, the claim that you are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic is an exaggeration of the findings.

While there were demonstrations during the 2005 Social Security debate, the description of the opponents as ""not disruptive crowds"" is an oversimplification.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was created in 1997, and it is a federal program that provides health coverage to children from low-income families. The number of children covered by CHIP varies by state and year, but it is not accurate to say that 7,000 kids in New Hampshire are covered by CHIP due to a specific individual's efforts. The claim is misleading and does not provide accurate information about the program's impact.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests a correlation between states that passed anti-illegal-immigrant legislation and the number of Hispanic legislators in those states. However, this claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion. It is a general statement that does not necessarily reflect the reality of the situation. The number of Hispanic legislators in a state can be influenced by various factors, including the state's demographics, political climate, and historical context, not just the presence of anti-illegal-immigrant legislation.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that unemployment rivals the Great Depression is an exaggeration. While the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in unemployment rates, they did not reach the levels seen during the Great Depression. In the U.S., unemployment peaked at around 14.8% in April 2020, while during the Great Depression, unemployment rates reached over 25%. Therefore, the claim is false.

He supported the surge of U.S. troops in 2007 and was critical of the Obama administration's timeline for withdrawal. However, he also emphasized the importance of working with the Iraqi government and respecting the wishes of the Iraqi people. Therefore, the claim that Sen. McCain would occupy Iraq indefinitely against their wishes is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

In 2008, the U.S. produced about 5.0 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil. By 2021, this had increased to over 11.0 million bpd, a rise of over 80 percent. This is the fastest increase in U.S. history in terms of both percentage and absolute numbers.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Texas in 2021 was approximately $1.7 trillion, while Australia's GDP was around $1.4 trillion. This means Texas' economy is about 21.4% larger than Australia's, not 30%.

"Explanation: The claim that hair stylists are required to undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants is false. The level of government scrutiny for professionals typically depends on the nature of their work and the potential risks they pose to the public. Hair stylists are regulated by state boards of cosmetology, which oversee their licensing and practice, but this is generally not considered more stringent than the regulations for foreclosure consultants. Foreclosure consultants are regulated by state real estate boards and must adhere to specific laws and regulations, but there is no evidence to suggest that they are subject to more scrutiny than hair stylists.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people is likely an exaggeration. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses (defined as those with fewer than 500 employees) account for 99.7% of all U.S. businesses and employ 47.5% of the private workforce. However, this does not mean that 90% of all workers are employed by companies with fewer than 100 employees. The claim seems to be an overgeneralization.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Thirty-four percent of Hispanics don't have any health care at all, don't have any health insurance"" is based on a specific study or data source. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, approximately 17.9% of Hispanics were uninsured. This figure is significantly lower than the 34% stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: There is no historical evidence to suggest that Abraham Lincoln was a fan of wrestling. While Lincoln was known for his physical strength and enjoyed outdoor activities, wrestling was not a sport he is recorded to have participated in or enjoyed. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a myth.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create a $1,761 yearly energy tax is false. The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which was the cap-and-trade plan proposed by the Obama administration, did not impose a $1,761 yearly energy tax on households. The act aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on emissions and allowing companies to trade permits. The actual impact on energy prices and household costs was complex and varied, but it did not result in a $1,761 yearly tax for all households.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Hillary Clinton's refugee plan is a misrepresentation of her actual policy proposals. Hillary Clinton's plan, as outlined during her 2016 presidential campaign, did not propose to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term. The figure of 620,000 is a fabrication and is not supported by any credible sources. Additionally, the claim that her plan would cost $400 billion in lifetime welfare and entitlement costs is also false. The cost estimates for refugee resettlement programs are significantly lower and are typically funded through a combination of federal and state funds, not through lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific data indicating that Rhode Island is leading the nation in foreclosures. Foreclosure rates can vary significantly by state and are influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, housing market trends, and local policies. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to refer to the latest data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or other reputable real estate market analysis firms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. The law aimed to increase access to health insurance and reduce the number of uninsured Americans. While the ACA did increase government spending, it also generated revenue through taxes and reduced costs through other provisions. The claim that the ACA will add trillions of dollars in debt is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the ACA would reduce the federal deficit by $145 billion over the 2016-2025 period.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Undocumented students who graduate from college can apply for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or other forms of relief, such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which can allow them to work legally in the United States. Additionally, some states and cities have policies that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and other forms of identification, which can help them secure jobs. The claim that they cannot get a job is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the economic impact of stadiums and sports franchises. While there are studies that suggest mixed or negative impacts, it is not accurate to say that ""no consistent, positive impact"" has been found. Some studies have shown positive impacts on local economies, including job creation and increased tax revenues. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the person voted against an increase in the minimum wage in the 1980s is false. The minimum wage in the United States was last increased in 2009, and there have been no significant increases since then. Therefore, it is not possible for the person to have voted against an increase in the minimum wage in the 1980s.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government owns tens of thousands of properties that are vacant or underused is true. According to various reports and studies, the U.S. government does indeed own a significant number of properties that are either vacant or underutilized. For instance, the General Services Administration (GSA) manages a portfolio of federal properties, and it has been reported that a substantial portion of these properties are either vacant or underused. This information is widely documented in various government reports and media outlets.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that representing an ex-boyfriend in a family law case is a common practice for lawyers. While it is possible for a lawyer to represent someone they have a personal relationship with, it is not a regular or common practice due to potential conflicts of interest. Lawyers are generally advised to avoid representing individuals with whom they have a personal or romantic relationship to maintain professional integrity and avoid bias.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you cannot pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes is false. In the United States Senate, a simple majority (51 votes) is required to pass most bills, including budgets. However, certain types of legislation, such as those involving the filibuster, may require a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. But for a budget, a simple majority is sufficient.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not advocate for a freeze on foreclosures during her 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, she proposed a plan to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, which included a ""temporary freeze on foreclosures"" for a period of time. Barack Obama, during his presidency, did not say ""no"" to a freeze on foreclosures. He implemented a program called the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Our pension system is the only one in the country that's 100 percent funded"" is false. In the United States, there are multiple types of pension systems, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, and hybrid plans. Each of these systems has different funding mechanisms and levels of funding. For example, the Social Security system is a defined benefit plan that is funded through payroll taxes, but it is not 100 percent funded. Similarly, many private pension plans are not 100 percent funded. Therefore, the claim that the pension system is the only one that is 100 percent funded is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the introduction of guns into national parks in 2010 led to a significant reduction in violent crimes such as rapes, murders, robberies, and assaults. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim. The National Park Service does not allow guns in national parks, and any changes in crime rates would be influenced by a multitude of factors, not just the presence of guns. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to back up the 85% reduction in crime.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994 is not accurate. While the VAWA has been credited with increasing awareness and providing resources for victims, the overall trend in domestic violence rates has been more complex. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, while there has been a decrease in domestic violence incidents, the rate of decline has not been consistent and has not reached a 50 percent reduction. Additionally, the most recent data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that the rate of intimate partner violence has fluctuated over time, with no clear trend of a 50 percent decrease since 1994.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information that indicates Gerald Daugherty is endorsed by the Austin American-Statesman. Endorsements by major news outlets are typically publicized and can be verified through official statements or press releases. Therefore, without such evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that this claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that under Cuccinellis tax cut plan, school divisions across Virginia could be forced to fire over 8,000 teachers is based on a misinterpretation of the tax cut plan's impact. The tax cut plan proposed by Governor Glenn Youngkin (not Cuccinelli) primarily affects the state's budget, which includes education funding. While the plan could potentially lead to budget cuts, the exact number of teachers that could be affected is not specified and would depend on various factors, including how the budget cuts are allocated. Therefore, the claim that over 8,000 teachers could be fired is an exaggeration and not supported by concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the insurance industry is mostly run by Democrats is not accurate. The insurance industry is a large and diverse sector that includes a wide range of companies and individuals from various political backgrounds. While it is true that some prominent insurance executives or companies may have Democratic leanings, it is not accurate to say that the industry as a whole is predominantly run by Democrats. The insurance industry is influenced by a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory environments, and consumer needs, rather than being primarily driven by political affiliation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Medicare will be gone in eight years if nothing is done is an exaggeration. Medicare's financial status is a complex issue, but it is not expected to run out of money in just eight years. The Medicare Trustees Report for 2021 projects that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted by 2028, but this does not mean Medicare will cease to exist. The program will continue to operate, but at a reduced level of benefits. The claim is therefore false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of 2021, the global solar PV industry employed around 12 million people, while the oil and gas industry employed around 10 million people. However, these numbers are not directly comparable due to differences in the scope of the industries and the methods of counting jobs. The solar industry includes not only direct employment in solar PV but also in related fields like manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. The oil and gas industry includes a wide range of activities from exploration to refining and distribution. Therefore, while the solar industry has a significant number of jobs, it is not accurate to say that there are more jobs in solar than in oil.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry is taking money away from hurricane victims and diverting it to remodel the Governor's Mansion is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, Governor Perry has been criticized for his handling of Hurricane Harvey, but there is no indication that he has redirected funds meant for victims to personal projects.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college is not accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in the 2019-2020 academic year, about 40% of Hispanic students received Pell Grants. This percentage is lower than the 50% stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: George Allen is a former U.S. Senator from Virginia. He served in the Senate from 2001 to 2007. However, he did not run for the U.S. Senate again after his term ended. Therefore, the claim that he is running for U.S. Senate candidacy is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Justin Amash is rated Michigan's No. 1 conservative by National Right to Life is false. While Justin Amash is a conservative Republican and has been a vocal advocate for gun rights, there is no evidence to support the claim that he is rated Michigan's No. 1 conservative by National Right to Life. National Right to Life is a pro-life organization, and their ratings are typically based on a candidate's stance on abortion, not their overall conservatism.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The claim states that 900 people have been fired since they became Secretary, and 60 of those were for manipulating wait times. This claim is not verifiable with the information provided, as it does not specify the time period or provide any sources to back up the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the information given.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is not a government takeover of healthcare. It is a law that expands access to healthcare by requiring most Americans to have health insurance, providing subsidies to help people afford coverage, and expanding Medicaid. It also includes provisions to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The law does not nationalize healthcare or replace private insurance with a government-run system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Obama wants to ""enact the single largest tax increase since the Second World War"" is false. This statement is a misinterpretation of Sen. Obama's proposed tax increases. While Sen. Obama did propose tax increases, the magnitude of these increases was not the largest since the Second World War. The claim is likely a distortion of his policies to create a negative narrative.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: John McCain and George W. Bush had differing views on tax breaks for oil companies. While McCain generally supported reducing tax breaks for oil companies, Bush was more supportive of them. Therefore, the claim that both McCain and Bush favor tax breaks for oil companies is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 1 percent of candidates endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in 2012 won is not accurate. The NRA endorsed a significant number of candidates in 2012, and many of those candidates went on to win their respective elections. The claim of a 1 percent win rate is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual results.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's polling numbers show that he is the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been is false. While Trump did receive a significant portion of the Hispanic vote in 2016, he did not achieve the highest level of support among Hispanics for any Republican presidential candidate. In fact, George W. Bush received a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote in 2004 than Trump did in 2016.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have specific data on Georgia's unemployment rate for the past 50 consecutive months. However, it is important to note that unemployment rates can fluctuate significantly over time due to various economic factors.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Georgia's State Route 400, also known as the Georgia 400, is a toll-free highway.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Bruce Starr was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws and greater accountability is not accurate. While Bruce Starr was known for his advocacy for ethics reform, there were other senators who also voted for or supported similar legislation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the rainy day fund has increased by 226 percent since January 2011. To verify this, we need to check the historical data of the rainy day fund. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the rainy day fund, also known as the Budget Stabilization Fund, has indeed grown significantly since 2011. However, the exact percentage increase needs to be calculated based on the fund's balance in January 2011 and its current balance. Without specific data points, it's challenging to confirm the exact 226 percent increase. Therefore, the claim is not definitively true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. David Cicilline, who served as the mayor of Providence from 2010 to 2018, did not make the statement that the city had a world-class school system. In fact, Providence's school system has consistently ranked among the lowest in the country in terms of academic performance. According to various education reports and rankings, Providence's school system has been one of the worst-performing in the United States.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Joe Biden's release of 33 years of tax returns is more than any presidential candidate in history is false. While Biden did release more tax returns than any previous presidential candidate, the claim that it is ""more than any presidential candidate in history"" is an exaggeration. Previous candidates, such as Donald Trump, have also released extensive tax returns, but Biden's release was indeed more comprehensive.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the individual never proposed privatizing the Milwaukee County airport is false.

Additionally, the claim is not a fact but an assertion that is not backed by any reliable data or information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the word ""progressive"" was created as a substitute for ""communist"" is false. The term ""progressive"" has been used in various contexts since the late 19th century, primarily to describe political and social movements that advocate for reform and change. It was not created as a direct substitute for ""communist."" The term ""communist"" has its own historical and political context, and the two terms are not interchangeable.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""more Georgians have jobs than at any other time since October 2008."" To verify this, we would need to look at the unemployment rate or the number of employed individuals in Georgia from October 2008 to the present. Without specific data, it is not possible to confirm the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on official statistics, it would be true if the current employment rate is higher than the rate in October 2008.

Answer: 1 (assuming the claim is based on official statistics and is true)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Standard & Poor's (S&P) did not say that the United States does not have the ability to repay its debt when they downgraded the U.S. credit rating in 2011. Instead, S&P stated that the U.S. government's ability to manage its debt was impaired by political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling. The downgrade was a result of the political deadlock over raising the debt ceiling, not a statement that the U.S. cannot repay its debt.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Rand Paul's 2011 budget included a big cut in the CDC is false. In 2011, Sen. Paul proposed a budget that included cuts to various government programs, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was not significantly impacted. The CDC's budget remained largely unchanged, and the proposed cuts were primarily focused on other areas of the federal budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. would gain revenue by cutting personal income tax rates in half and ending tax breaks is not accurate. Cutting personal income tax rates in half would likely reduce the amount of revenue collected from personal income taxes. Additionally, ending tax breaks would also reduce revenue, as many tax breaks are designed to encourage certain behaviors or provide relief to specific groups. Therefore, the claim that this would result in a gain in revenue is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require taxpayers to pay for abortions. The ACA prohibits federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Virginia's recent intervention, through the passage of a law that prohibits the use of state funds for abortions, does not change the federal law. Therefore, the claim that Virginia taxpayers would have been forced to pay for abortions under Obamacare is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika. To verify this claim, I would need to check the voting records of all candidates and compare their votes on measures related to Zika funding. Without specific information on the votes of other candidates, I cannot definitively say whether Murphy is the only one who voted against every measure to fund Zika.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act was a federal law passed in 2002, but many states had implemented similar education reform initiatives before the federal law was enacted. For example, Texas had a similar law called the Texas Accountability System, which was implemented in 1994. This law aimed to improve schools by setting performance standards and providing resources for struggling schools. The claim suggests that a similar state-level law had a positive impact on schools, which aligns with the general findings of research on such initiatives.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim that stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters is false. The U.S. government's stimulus packages, such as the CARES Act, were designed to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no evidence to suggest that any portion of these funds was specifically allocated to purchase electric cars from Finland or as a form of political payback to Obama supporters.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""On eliminating the influence of money in policy campaigns"" is a broad statement that is generally true but not entirely accurate. Money does play a significant role in political campaigns, but there are also many other factors that influence policy campaigns, such as public opinion, media coverage, and grassroots support. Additionally, the elimination of money in policy campaigns is not a feasible or practical solution, as it would likely lead to other forms of influence and potentially undermine the democratic process.

"Explanation: Senator Jim Webb served as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate from 2007 to 2009. He was known for being a centrist Democrat and was not a reliable vote for President Obama or Senator Harry Reid.

Therefore, the claim that Senator Webb was a reliable vote for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid is false.

"Explanation: The claim that homicides against blacks have tripled since Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law has been in existence is not accurate. While there have been some studies suggesting an increase in homicides involving black victims in Florida, the claim that this increase is tripled is an exaggeration. The ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows individuals to use deadly force if they feel threatened, has been in effect since 2005, but the overall homicide rates and the rates of homicides against blacks have not shown a tripling. The claim is misleading and not supported by reliable data.

"Explanation: The claim that Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell voted for a toll lane on MoPac is false. Mayor Leffingwell was in office from 2011 to 2015, and during his tenure, there were no votes or decisions made regarding toll lanes on MoPac. The current mayor, Steve Adler, has been in office since 2016, and it is unclear if he has voted on this issue.

"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker will be the only economist in the U.S. House. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that the speaker is the only economist in the U.S. House. The House of Representatives typically has a diverse group of members with various backgrounds, including economists. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that the speaker will be the only economist.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ohio Gov. John Kasich got lucky with fracking is a simplification of the complex economic factors that have contributed to Ohio's economic growth. While fracking has played a role in Ohio's economic development, it is not accurate to attribute the state's success solely to ""luck"" or to the actions of a single individual. Ohio's economic growth is the result of a combination of factors, including the state's strategic location, investments in infrastructure, education, and workforce development, as well as the state's efforts to attract and retain businesses.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the Associated Press (AP) called Charlie Crist's attacks ""over the top,"" ""out of context,"" and ""not true."" However, there is no evidence or source provided to support this claim. The Associated Press is a reputable news agency, but it is not known for making such direct evaluations of political statements. Therefore, without a credible source or context, it is not possible to verify the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 7,000 millionaires gamed the system to pay no income taxes is a generalization and lacks specific evidence. While it is true that some wealthy individuals may use legal tax avoidance strategies, such as exploiting loopholes in tax laws, it is not accurate to say that 7,000 millionaires have done so. The number 7,000 is not supported by any credible source, and the claim is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the facts.

"Explanation: The claim that 90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted is a misrepresentation of the facts. While it is true that the abortion rate for pregnancies with Down syndrome is higher than the general population, the 90 percent figure is an exaggeration. Studies have shown that the abortion rate for pregnancies with Down syndrome is around 60-70 percent, not 90 percent. This claim is often used to argue against abortion rights, but it is important to present accurate information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Steve Jobs was responsible for creating more jobs than the stimulus bill is not accurate. While Steve Jobs was a significant figure in the tech industry and his companies, Apple and Pixar, have created many jobs, the stimulus bill, which was a government initiative to stimulate the economy during the 2008 financial crisis, created a much larger number of jobs. The stimulus bill was designed to provide immediate relief to the economy and create jobs in various sectors, including construction, education, and healthcare. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you cannot destroy guns purchased in a buyback program is false. In many gun buyback programs, the guns are indeed destroyed after being collected. The goal of these programs is to reduce the number of firearms in circulation, and one way to achieve this is by physically destroying the guns. Memphis, like many other cities, has implemented such programs, and the guns collected are typically melted down or otherwise rendered unusable.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that taxpayers pay for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin and 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee is misleading. While it is true that Medicaid, a government-funded health insurance program, covers a significant portion of births in Wisconsin, the claim that taxpayers pay for 45% of all births and 60% of births in Milwaukee is an overstatement. Medicaid covers births for low-income individuals, but it does not cover all births in Wisconsin or Milwaukee. The claim also does not specify that it is referring to Medicaid coverage, which could lead to confusion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not bar the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs) to pay for non-prescription health needs such as aspirin. In fact, the ACA allows for the use of FSAs and HSAs to pay for a wide range of health expenses, including over-the-counter medications, with a prescription from a healthcare provider. This change was made to simplify the use of these accounts and to encourage preventive care.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Patrick Murphy, a former U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, has indeed passed several bills out of committee during his time in Congress. For example, he was a co-sponsor of the ""Veterans' Access, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2015,"" which passed the House of Representatives. Therefore, the claim that he has not passed a single bill out of committee is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin lost 10,000 jobs over the past 12 months, while California lost 1,000,000 jobs. Therefore, Wisconsin did not lose more jobs than any other state over the past 12 months.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State"" is false. New York State has banned hydraulic fracturing (fracking) since 2014, but the state has experienced issues with waste from fracking operations in other states being transported and disposed of in New York. For instance, in 2019, a waste disposal company was fined for improperly disposing of fracking waste in New York. Therefore, the claim that no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State is inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplified comparison of tax rates without considering the progressive nature of the tax system. In the United States, for example, the tax rate increases as income increases, but the effective tax rate (the total tax paid as a percentage of income) for higher earners is not necessarily four times that of lower earners. This is because higher earners often have more deductions, credits, and other tax advantages that reduce their effective tax rate. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Secretary of State John Kerry did not support Hamas to the exclusion of the Arab League. In fact, Kerry's visit to Paris and his meeting with Hamas representatives were part of broader efforts to engage with various stakeholders in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including Hamas, to promote peace and stability. The criticism he faced was more about the timing and method of his engagement with Hamas, rather than his support for them to the exclusion of other parties.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific interpretation of the Republicans' alternative health care plan, which is a complex and evolving policy proposal. The statement that insurers will be able to raise premiums four times faster than wages is a simplification and may not accurately reflect the nuances of the plan. The actual impact on premiums and wages would depend on various factors, including the specific provisions of the plan and how they are implemented. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false without more detailed information.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim is based on an analysis by independent experts, which suggests that Donald Trump's tax plan would increase the national debt by over $5 trillion and could disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy.

Additionally, in recent years, there have been discussions and proposals from Democratic lawmakers regarding tax policy, including extensions or modifications of the Bush tax cuts.

"Explanation: The claim that the federal government is the largest energy user in the country is false. While the federal government does consume a significant amount of energy, it is not the largest energy user in the country. The largest energy users are typically large corporations, such as those in the manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture sectors. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that in 2020, the residential sector was the largest energy consumer, followed by the commercial sector, and then the industrial sector, which includes large corporations. The federal government's energy consumption is a significant portion of the total, but it is not the largest.

"Explanation: The claim that today's marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear is an exaggeration. While it is true that the potency of marijuana has increased over time, the claim of a 300 percent to 800 percent increase is not supported by scientific evidence. The potency of marijuana is typically measured in terms of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content, and while modern strains may have higher THC content than older strains, the increase is generally in the range of 10-20 percent, not 300-800 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the spending of the Democrats in one month to the spending of President Bush over seven years on the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, and Hurricane Katrina. This comparison is misleading because it does not account for the different time frames and the nature of the spending. The spending by the Democrats in one month is likely a fraction of the total spending by President Bush over seven years. Additionally, the spending by the Democrats is likely for different purposes and may not be directly comparable to the spending on wars and natural disasters.

"Explanation: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's average annual wage growth from 2019 to 2021 was 3.5%, which is slightly below the national average of 3.7%. Similarly, Wisconsin's job growth rate from 2019 to 2021 was 1.5%, which is also slightly below the national average of 1.8%. Therefore, the claim that Wisconsin is below the national average in wage growth and job growth is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that people who are unemployed and give up looking for jobs are suddenly considered employed, which is not accurate. Unemployment rates are calculated based on people who are actively seeking work. If someone stops looking for work, they are no longer considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate. Therefore, the claim is misleading and false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that of the 25 wealthiest nations, the United States is the only one that doesn't provide basic health coverage. This is a false statement. While it is true that the United States does not have a universal healthcare system like many other developed countries, it is not accurate to say that it is the only wealthy nation without such a system. For example, some wealthy nations like Switzerland and Singapore have healthcare systems that are not fully universal but still provide significant coverage.

"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney supported a law that could have made most common forms of birth control illegal is false. During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney did support a law that would have allowed states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, but this law did not make most common forms of birth control illegal. Instead, it would have allowed employers to refuse to cover contraception if it went against their religious beliefs. The claim is misleading and exaggerates Romney's position.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the most significant driver of out-migration from Rhode Island is the estate tax is not accurate. While estate taxes can be a factor in some cases, they are not the primary driver of out-migration. Other significant factors include economic opportunities, cost of living, and quality of life. Additionally, Rhode Island's estate tax is not particularly high compared to other states, and it does not apply to all estates. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in 2019, the top 1% of Americans paid 40.1% of the income taxes, while the bottom 50% paid 3.1%. The claim that 5% of Americans pay over half the income taxes is incorrect. Additionally, the claim that 40% of Americans pay no income taxes is also incorrect. The IRS data shows that in 2019, 44.5% of Americans did not pay any income tax, but this is due to various factors such as income below the taxable threshold, tax credits, and deductions.

"Explanation: The claim that Nevada has been recently ranked No. 1 in unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy, and divorce is false. While Nevada has faced significant economic challenges in recent years, it has not been ranked No. 1 in all these categories. For instance, Nevada has had high unemployment rates, but it has not been ranked No. 1 in unemployment. Similarly, while Nevada has had high foreclosure rates, it has not been ranked No. 1 in foreclosures. The same applies to violent crime, personal bankruptcy, and divorce rates. These rankings are often based on national surveys and reports, and Nevada's rankings in these categories are not consistently at the top.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the annual deaths from tobacco to the total deaths from World War II, AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide, and suicide combined. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tobacco use is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States. The total deaths from World War II in the U.S. were approximately 400,000. The combined deaths from AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide, and suicide are significantly lower than the deaths from tobacco. Therefore, the claim is true.

"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump is going to ""carpet bomb"" the Middle East is false. Carpet bombing is a military strategy that involves dropping a large number of bombs over a wide area, often resulting in significant civilian casualties. This strategy is widely condemned due to its indiscriminate nature and the high risk of civilian casualties. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible evidence or official statement from Donald Trump or his administration indicating that he plans to use carpet bombing in the Middle East. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of his policies or statements.

"Explanation: The claim is about the allocation of funds in the United States, specifically mentioning pork barrel projects and earmark projects. Pork barrel projects are a form of political corruption where government funds are allocated to benefit specific individuals or groups, often in exchange for political support. Earmark projects are specific projects or programs that are funded by the government. The claim suggests that $20 billion was spent on these projects and that some of this money could have been used for bridge inspections instead. However, the claim does not provide any specific sources or evidence to support the $20 billion figure or the suggestion that the money could have been used differently. Therefore, without concrete evidence or sources, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years is not accurate. Medicare's financial status is a complex issue, but it is not expected to become insolvent in the near future. The Medicare Trustees Report, released annually, provides projections about Medicare's financial status. According to the 2021 report, Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is expected to be depleted in 2026, but this does not mean Medicare will be bankrupt. The program will continue to operate, but at a reduced level of benefits. Additionally, the report also notes that the Medicare program is expected to remain solvent through 2030 if certain changes are made to the program.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn laws passed by Congress, and it has done so in the past.

Therefore, the claim that it would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step is not accurate.

However, the war did not start until 2003, and the person's opposition to the war would have been relevant from 2003 onwards. Therefore, the claim that the person opposed the war in 2002 is false.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that by simply inflating tires and getting regular tune-ups, we could save all the oil that is being discussed in the context of drilling. This claim is misleading because while proper tire inflation and regular tune-ups can help improve fuel efficiency and reduce oil consumption, they are not a significant enough factor to save all the oil that is being discussed in the context of drilling. Drilling for oil is a complex process that involves significant energy and resource inputs, and the amount of oil that can be saved through tire inflation and tune-ups is minimal compared to the total oil consumption and drilling activities.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law"" is a generalization that is not supported by specific data or evidence. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was signed into law in 2010, and while it has had various impacts on the economy and healthcare, it is not accurate to say that businesses have created jobs every single month since its implementation. Job creation can vary significantly from month to month due to numerous factors, and it is not accurate to attribute all job creation to a single piece of legislation.

"Explanation: The claim that every time taxes have been cut, revenues have gone up and the economy has grown is a simplification of complex economic phenomena. While tax cuts can stimulate economic growth in the short term, they can also lead to reduced government revenue, which can negatively impact public services and infrastructure. Additionally, the impact of tax cuts on revenue and economic growth can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances, such as the size of the tax cut, the economic conditions at the time, and the composition of the tax base. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time taxes have been cut, revenues have gone up and the economy has grown.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama said an attack on Syria was going to be a ""pinprick"" is false. While President Obama did discuss the possibility of a limited military strike on Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons, he did not use the term ""pinprick."" The term was used by other officials and analysts to describe the potential scope of the strike, but it was not a direct quote from President Obama.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Pell Bridge, also known as the Pell Island Bridge, is a bridge that connects the mainland to Pell Island in Maine, USA. It is primarily used for commuter traffic, as it is a vital link for residents of the island and the mainland. While it does attract some tourists due to its scenic views and the historic nature of the island, its primary function is not tourism but rather commuting. Therefore, the claim that the Pell Bridge is essentially a tourism bridge and not a commuter bridge is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Colorado food stamp recipients can use ATMs to get cash to buy marijuana is false. Food stamp benefits in Colorado, like in many other states, are intended to purchase food and other essential items. The benefits are typically loaded onto an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which can be used at participating retailers to purchase eligible items. However, these benefits cannot be used to purchase cash or non-food items like marijuana. Additionally, there is no provision for using ATMs to withdraw cash specifically for marijuana purchases.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Republicans stood on the sidelines when Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid were created is false. In fact, many key figures in the creation of these programs were Republicans. For example, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, proposed Social Security in 1935, but it was Republicans who played a significant role in its passage through Congress. Similarly, Medicare was created under President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, but the legislation was supported by a bipartisan coalition in Congress, including many Republicans. Medicaid was created under President Richard Nixon, a Republican, and was supported by a bipartisan coalition in Congress.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which found that gun violence is the leading cause of death for young African American men. The study reported that gun violence accounted for 50% of deaths among African American men aged 15-34, while the next nine causes of death combined accounted for 40%. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that violent crime is lower in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is a topic of ongoing debate and research. Studies on the relationship between gun laws and crime rates have produced mixed results. Some studies suggest that states with more permissive gun laws have higher rates of violent crime, while others find no significant correlation or even a slight decrease in crime rates. The claim is not universally accepted and is subject to interpretation based on the specific studies and methodologies used.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Kendrick Meek was named one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is false. CREW has not named Kendrick Meek as one of the most corrupt Democrats in Congress. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a nation is the ""most highly taxed"" can be subjective and depends on the specific taxes being considered (e.g., income tax, sales tax, property tax, etc.). However, as of my last update in October 2023, the country with the highest overall tax burden is typically considered to be Sweden. Sweden has a high tax rate, with a top income tax rate of around 57.5% and a comprehensive tax-to-GDP ratio of approximately 45%. Therefore, the claim that a nation is the ""most highly taxed"" is generally true when referring to Sweden.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The total value of platinum in the world is significantly less than the U.S. national debt. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt was approximately $28 trillion, while the total value of platinum in the world is estimated to be around $100 billion. Therefore, even if you took every ounce of platinum in the world, it would not be enough to pay down the U.S. national debt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In Oregon, minors under the age of 18 cannot consent to sterilization without parental consent. The Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) 40.700.010 states that a minor cannot consent to sterilization without the consent of a parent or guardian. Therefore, the claim that girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The ""Fast and Furious"" operation, also known as Operation Wide Receiver, was a controversial law enforcement program that began in 2009 under the Obama administration. The program was designed to track the flow of weapons from the United States to Mexican drug cartels. The claim that it started in the Bush administration is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan is false. The U.S. government does not have a specific plan for a zombie apocalypse. While there are contingency plans for various emergencies, including natural disasters and public health crises, there is no evidence to suggest that the government has allocated resources specifically for a zombie apocalypse scenario. This claim is a humorous or satirical exaggeration, not a factual statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Rob Portman, a former U.S. Senator and current U.S. Trade Representative, has been criticized for his role in trade policies that some argue have led to job losses in the Mahoning Valley and other regions. However, the claim that he ""sucked the jobs out of the Mahoning Valley and sent them to China"" is an oversimplification and lacks specific evidence. While Portman's policies may have contributed to job losses, it is not accurate to attribute all of these losses solely to him. The claim also ignores the complex interplay of global economic factors, technological advancements, and other domestic policies that have influenced job markets.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson wore a T-shirt stating ""We Stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen"" is false. There is no evidence or verified reports to support this claim. The Rock has been known to express his views on social issues, but this specific statement has not been attributed to him.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ending federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) would jeopardize 9,000 jobs is based on a 2019 report by the NPR that stated that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if federal funding were to be eliminated. However, this report was a projection and not a guarantee. The actual impact on jobs would depend on various factors, including the ability of NPR to secure alternative funding sources and the specific circumstances of the job market. Therefore, while the claim is based on a real report, it is not necessarily accurate to say that 9,000 jobs would be jeopardized.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Florida Insurance Commissioner, David Altman, has been actively involved in negotiating lower rates and advocating for consumers under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). He has been critical of the federal government's handling of the healthcare law and has worked to ensure that Floridians have access to affordable healthcare options. Therefore, the claim that Florida refused to allow the insurance commissioner to negotiate lower rates or refuse rates that are too high is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Rick Scott, a former Governor of Florida, has not publicly stated that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Georgia's CRCT (Criterion-Referenced Competency Test) sets some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation is not accurate. The CRCT is a standardized test used in Georgia to measure student achievement in various subjects. While the specific proficiency levels and expectations may vary, it is not accurate to say that Georgia has the lowest expectations in the nation. The expectations and proficiency levels are set by the Georgia Department of Education and are based on state standards, which are comparable to those in other states.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""He's been endorsed by 'every major newspaper here in the state of Texas'"" is highly unlikely to be true. Endorsements from ""every major newspaper"" would be a significant achievement and would typically be widely reported and verified. However, there is no evidence provided to support this claim, and it is not a common occurrence for a single individual to receive endorsements from every major newspaper in a large state like Texas.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of the latest data available, the House of Representatives does not have a majority of prochoice members. The majority of the House is composed of Republicans, who are generally more conservative on social issues, including abortion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""a record four out of every 10 school kids in Ohio now qualifies for subsidized lunch."" This claim is based on a specific statistic about the number of students eligible for subsidized lunch programs. To verify the claim, I would need to check the latest data from reliable sources such as the Ohio Department of Education or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which manages the National School Lunch Program. Without this specific data, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: Florida is not the largest dog-racing state in the country.

Florida does have dog racing, but it is not the largest in the country.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""We cut our deficits by more than half"" is vague and does not specify the time period or the context in which the deficit was cut. Without specific details, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, it cannot be determined if the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies emit unlimited carbon pollution into our air is false. Sen. Johnson has voted against several bills that would have increased regulations on carbon emissions, but he has not voted to allow unlimited carbon pollution. He has also supported measures to address climate change, such as investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard, the graduation rates for the universities listed are as follows:
- Rutgers University: 60.5%
- Kean University: 33.3%
- Montclair State University: 50.1%
- New Jersey City University: 27.3%
- Stockton College: 27.3%
- Rowan University: 51.3%
- William Paterson University: 55.1%

Only Montclair State University and William Paterson University have graduation rates above 50% within four years. Therefore, the claim that all of these universities graduate less than 50% of their students within four years is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a change in law carried out by the speaker stopped a $100 million tax increase in the Dallas school district is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess the truth of this claim, one would need to consult official records, statements from the Dallas school district, or other reliable sources that can confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""Jeff Greene on why he went to Cuba"" is incomplete and lacks context. Without additional information about who Jeff Greene is and the specific reason for his visit to Cuba, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
"Explanation: The claim that the average public school teacher in Wisconsin makes $89,000 a year in salary and benefits is false. According to the National Education Association, the average salary for public school teachers in Wisconsin in the 2020-2021 school year was approximately $61,000. Benefits can add to this amount, but the total compensation is still significantly lower than the claimed $89,000.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The U.S. Mint has reported that the cost to produce a one-cent coin is more than a penny, and the cost to produce a five-cent coin is more than a nickel. This is due to the increasing cost of materials and the complexity of the minting process.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim ""Says he never voted for a tax increase"" is a statement about a person's voting record. To evaluate its truthfulness, we would need to verify the person's voting history. Without specific information about the person's voting record, we cannot definitively determine if the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Scott's sale of the state planes was not proper is a complex issue that depends on the specific circumstances and legal interpretations. Without detailed information about the sale, such as the process followed, the reasons for the sale, and any legal challenges or investigations, it is difficult to definitively determine the validity of the claim. However, if there are specific allegations of impropriety, such as conflicts of interest, lack of transparency, or violations of state procurement laws, then the claim could be true.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be definitively judged as true without more information.)"
"Explanation: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is ""job killing"" is a complex issue that has been debated extensively. Some studies suggest that the ACA may have led to a reduction in full-time employment, particularly among low-wage workers, due to the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees. However, other studies and analyses have shown that the overall impact on employment is minimal or even positive, with the ACA providing access to health insurance for millions of Americans who previously did not have it. Therefore, the claim that the ACA is ""job killing"" is not universally accepted and is subject to interpretation based on the specific data and studies one chooses to consider.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly prohibit someone from running for Congress simultaneously in multiple states. The Constitution does not address the issue of dual candidacies, leaving it to state laws and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to regulate such situations. However, the FEC has rules that can affect dual candidacies, such as the requirement to file a Statement of Candidacy in each state where one is running. Therefore, while the Constitution does not prevent it, practical and regulatory considerations may make it difficult or impossible to run for Congress in multiple states simultaneously.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Betty Sutton voted to destroy Medicare in 2010 is false. Betty Sutton was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio's 16th district from 2005 to 2013. She was a Democrat and did not vote to destroy Medicare. In fact, she was a strong supporter of Medicare and voted against any legislation that would have significantly weakened or dismantled the program.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The fiscal cliff agreement, which was reached in early 2013, included a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. While it did result in significant tax increases, it is not accurate to say that it was the largest tax increase in history. The fiscal cliff agreement was part of a broader package of measures aimed at addressing the U.S. budget deficit, and while it was a substantial increase, it was not unprecedented in terms of magnitude compared to other major tax increases in U.S. history.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On the mosque near ground zero"" is false. The World Trade Center and the surrounding area, including the mosque, were not affected by the 9/11 attacks. The mosque, known as the World Trade Center Mosque, is located in the same area but was not damaged during the attacks. The claim is a misinterpretation of the location and the events.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. During his presidency, he was heavily involved in national security affairs, including decisions on military operations, intelligence, and foreign policy. He also served as a member of the Illinois State Senate and as a U.S. Senator before his presidency, where he gained experience in policy-making and legislative processes. Therefore, the claim that Obama ""has no experience or background at all in national security affairs"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that White House spokesman Robert Gibbs lied when he said President Obama's birth certificate is posted on the Internet is false. In 2011, President Obama released his long-form birth certificate to address persistent rumors about his citizenship. This was done through the White House website, and the document was verified by the Hawaii Department of Health. Therefore, Gibbs' statement was accurate, and the claim that he lied is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes a provision for end-of-life counseling, but it is entirely voluntary. The provision, known as the ""Five Questions"" or ""Five Wishes,"" is designed to help patients discuss their end-of-life preferences with their healthcare providers. However, patients are not required to participate in this counseling, and it is not a mandatory part of the healthcare reform bill.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by John McCain's top lobbyist, Tony Blankley, during the 2000 presidential campaign. Blankley did indeed say, ""The American people won't care about this,"" when asked about the hiring of lobbyists for McCain's campaign. This statement was reported in various news outlets at the time, including The Washington Post and The New York Times. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the U.S. for asthma"" is not verifiable without specific data or sources. To accurately judge the claim, one would need to refer to reliable sources such as the American Lung Association's State of the Air report or similar health studies that rank cities based on asthma rates. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""For every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion"" is a misrepresentation of the actual data. According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2017, 34% of women who visited Planned Parenthood health centers for abortion services received an abortion. This means that the majority of women who visit Planned Parenthood for abortion services do not receive an abortion, and the claim that 32 out of 33 women receive an abortion is a significant exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Virginia Department of Health spends approximately $100,000 on abstinence education programs, not $400,000. Additionally, the claim that Virginia lost $2.5 million in federal funds due to Gov. Bob McDonnells' political agenda is not supported by any credible sources. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the facts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Democratic Party created the Ku Klux Klan is false. The Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1865 by a group of former Confederate soldiers in Pulaski, Tennessee. The Democratic Party did not create the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan's initial purpose was to intimidate and terrorize newly freed slaves and their supporters, and it was later revived in the 1910s and 1920s with a focus on anti-immigration and anti-Catholic sentiments. The Democratic Party has a history of supporting civil rights and has been opposed to the Ku Klux Klan.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump mocked someone with a disability is based on a specific incident that occurred during his 2016 presidential campaign. In a 2016 rally, Trump was seen mimicking a reporter with a disability, which was widely criticized as ableist and disrespectful. This incident was widely reported and verified by multiple news outlets.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that the state auditor found that 37 percent of the 428,000 students receiving free and reduced-price lunches are ineligible. This claim is false because it is not possible for 37 percent of the students to be ineligible if they are already receiving free or reduced-price lunches. The percentage of ineligible students should be less than 100 percent, and the claim suggests that a significant portion of the students are receiving the wrong type of assistance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: President Obama did not campaign on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan. While he did support and sign into law the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which included provisions for reproductive health care, this was not the primary focus of his campaign. His campaign platform emphasized issues like healthcare reform, economic recovery, and ending the Iraq War.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The House of Representatives has indeed sued a sitting president in U.S. history. In 1998, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Bill Clinton, accusing him of perjury and obstruction of justice. Although he was acquitted by the Senate, this is a clear example of the House suing a sitting president.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the Texas Department of Agriculture, the top five counties in Texas by cattle inventory are: 1. Tom Green County, 2. Bexar County, 3. Nueces County, 4.

"Explanation: The claim that Kasich's trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs, specifically 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China, is not accurate. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of trade data. Trade deals can lead to job losses in certain sectors, but they also create new jobs in other sectors. The specific numbers provided are not supported by reliable sources or economic data. The claim is misleading and not based on factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Jon Corzine, a former Senator, was subpoenaed to testify before the Senate, it is not the first time in history that a former Senator has been subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues. There have been numerous instances of former Senators being called to testify before the Senate in the past.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the person never supported the federal health care individual mandate is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes an individual mandate that requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. The person in question, Donald Trump, has publicly stated his opposition to the ACA and the individual mandate, but he did not support the mandate when it was first implemented.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of data from a study by the Federal Reserve. The study found that the top 400 wealthiest Americans have more wealth than the bottom 50% of Americans combined. However, this does not mean that the top 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans. The bottom 50% includes the top 400 Americans, so the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida had five sanctuary cities while Jeb Bush was governor is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no official record or widely accepted information that supports the claim that Florida had five sanctuary cities during Jeb Bush's tenure as governor. Sanctuary cities are typically defined as cities that have policies in place to limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, and the number of such cities in Florida has been a subject of debate and misinformation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the timing of the announcement for the president is vague and does not provide specific details or context. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Pell Grants were first introduced in 1972, and by 1976, they were fully funded. In 1976, a full Pell Grant covered 72% of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college. Over the years, the purchasing power of Pell Grants has decreased due to inflation and changes in the cost of attendance. In the 2021-2022 academic year, a full Pell Grant covered 34% of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that 17 intelligence agencies have concluded that cyberattacks on U.S. elections come from the highest levels of the Kremlin is a complex issue. While it is true that multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed cyberattacks to Russian actors, including those linked to the Russian government, the claim that these attacks are ""designed to influence our election"" is more nuanced. The intelligence community has reported that Russian actors interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but the extent to which these actions were specifically designed to influence the election rather than other activities is a matter of ongoing debate and investigation.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or misleading as it simplifies and generalizes the intelligence community's findings.)"
"Explanation: The claim about Andrew Cuomo creating 500 jobs at a cost of $1.5 million per job in the SolarCity project is misleading and likely false. The SolarCity project in Buffalo, which was announced in 2017, was intended to create 3,000 jobs, not 500. Additionally, the cost per job figure of $1.5 million is not accurate and seems to be an exaggeration. The actual cost per job for such projects is typically much lower.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence that former President Barack Obama made this statement. The claim appears to be a misattribution of a statement made by another politician or a fabrication.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which reports that 30.4% of Texas college students graduate within four years and 58.1% graduate within six years.

"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, Nancy Pelosi, and Al Gore are all prominent political figures in the United States, but they have not collaborated on global warming. Newt Gingrich is known for his skepticism about climate change, while Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore are both prominent advocates for addressing global warming. Therefore, the claim that they have teamed up on global warming is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Senate immigration bill would result in a population increase of over 70 million people in 20 years is an exaggeration and not supported by the actual provisions of the bill. The Senate immigration bill, known as the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, aims to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the U.S., increase the number of refugees admitted, and reform the visa system. While it does increase the number of immigrants, the projected population increase is not as dramatic as the claim suggests. Estimates from various sources, including the Migration Policy Institute, suggest that the bill would increase the U.S. population by several million over the next 20 years, but not by 70 million.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama ""shunned the opportunity to talk to soldiers to thank them for their service"" is false. In fact, President Obama made several visits to military bases and troops during his presidency to express his gratitude and support. For example, he visited troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations to thank them for their service and to discuss the ongoing operations. These visits were widely reported in the media and are documented in historical records.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there are pipes carrying natural gas in this country made of wood is false. Natural gas pipelines are typically made of materials like steel, plastic, or composite materials, not wood. Wood is not suitable for this purpose due to its susceptibility to rot, insects, and other environmental factors that could compromise the integrity of the pipeline.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney says ""class sizes don't matter"" is false. Mitt Romney has publicly stated that class size does matter and that reducing class sizes can improve educational outcomes. For example, in a 2012 presidential debate, Romney mentioned that reducing class sizes can help teachers provide better instruction. Therefore, the claim is a misrepresentation of Romney's actual stance on the issue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator and former presidential candidate. The statement suggests that Cruz's TV ad about John Kasich was a lie and that stations had to pull it off the air. However, there is no specific evidence provided to support this claim, and it is not widely reported that such an incident occurred. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""My office sends federal money back every year"" is false. Federal money, such as tax refunds, is typically sent to individuals or businesses based on their tax returns and is not something that an office would ""send back"" annually. The process involves the IRS calculating the amount of tax owed or refundable and then sending the appropriate amount to the taxpayer.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that there are over 25 million people living in Texas and less than 2 percent of them have concealed handgun licenses. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, as of 2021, there are approximately 25.1 million people living in Texas. The Texas Department of Public Safety also reports that as of 2021, there are about 1.6 million active concealed handgun licenses in Texas. To verify the claim, we can calculate the percentage of people with concealed handgun licenses:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of concealed handgun licenses}}{\text{Total population}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1,600,000}{25,100,000} \right) \times 100 \approx 6.37\% \]

Since 6.37% is greater than 2%, the claim that less than 2 percent of Texans have concealed handgun licenses is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) which estimated that reducing pay and benefits for federal employees could save $103 billion over 10 years. However, this figure is not a direct savings but rather a projection based on various scenarios and assumptions. Additionally, the claim that this would amount to more than $50,000 per worker is misleading as it does not specify the number of workers or the distribution of the savings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the person is the ""first Aggie governor of Texas"" is not verifiable with the information provided. The term ""Aggie"" typically refers to graduates of Texas A&M University, but without specific details about the person's name, term in office, and their connection to Texas A&M, it is impossible to confirm this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's collective-bargaining limits and their impact on the city of Milwaukee's budget. Walker implemented collective-bargaining limits in 2011, which restricted public employees' collective bargaining rights. These changes were part of a broader effort to reduce government spending and balance the state's budget. However, the specific impact on the city of Milwaukee's budget is not directly stated in the claim, and the claim does not provide any evidence or context to support the assertion that these limits helped balance the city's budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey's public school students have the best Advanced Placement (AP) scores in the nation is not accurate. While New Jersey does have a strong education system and its students often perform well on AP exams, it is not accurate to say that they have the best scores in the nation. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the 30 percent set aside for affordable housing in urban renewal areas is calculated citywide, not district by district. This claim is false because the 30 percent requirement is typically applied on a project-by-project basis, rather than being a citywide average. Each project within an urban renewal area must meet the 30 percent affordable housing requirement, but the overall citywide percentage can vary based on the specific projects and their locations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, it did not grant personhood status to the preborn. The Dobbs decision merely held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, leaving the issue to the states. The claim that this is the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn is incorrect because there have been other cases and laws that have recognized fetal personhood in various forms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Republican candidates in Oregon are advocating violence against gays is a false statement. There is no evidence to support this claim, and it is a misrepresentation of the political views and actions of Republican candidates in Oregon. Republican candidates, like any other political candidates, may have differing views on various issues, but advocating violence is not a part of their platform or any credible political discourse.

"Explanation: The claim that ""the debt will soon eclipse our entire economy"" is a broad and vague statement that lacks specific context or data. It is not possible to accurately assess the truth of this claim without knowing which economy is being referred to, what time frame is being considered, and what specific debt is being discussed. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests a correlation between gains in Atlanta Public Schools scores on a national standardized test and dramatic score increases on state tests. However, correlation does not imply causation. Gains on a national standardized test do not necessarily indicate that the same improvements will be reflected on state tests. The two tests may have different formats, content, or scoring systems, and improvements on one do not guarantee improvements on the other. Therefore, the claim is not necessarily true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: A ""no-tax pledge"" is a political promise made by a candidate or politician to not raise taxes. This pledge is often used in political campaigns to attract voters who are opposed to tax increases. However, it is important to note that such pledges can be made without any legal or binding force, and politicians may still raise taxes after being elected if they believe it is necessary for their policy goals. Therefore, the claim that signing a no-tax pledge is a binding legal commitment is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the number-one source of illegal immigration is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population is not accurate. While it is true that some individuals overstay their visas, the majority of illegal immigrants enter the country through the southern border without proper documentation. According to the U.S. Border Patrol, the majority of apprehensions at the southern border are of individuals who do not have valid entry documents. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security reports that the number of overstays has been decreasing in recent years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Al Qaeda has camps with the drug cartels in Mexico. While it is true that Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have attempted to establish links with drug cartels for funding and operational purposes, there is no specific evidence of Al Qaeda having camps or bases in Mexico in collaboration with drug cartels. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the broader issue of transnational criminal networks.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Romneycare (Massachusetts Health Care Reform) sent costs spiraling out of control and hiking premiums is not accurate. While there were initial increases in premiums, the overall impact of Romneycare was to reduce the number of uninsured residents and improve access to healthcare. A study by the Commonwealth Fund found that the uninsured rate in Massachusetts dropped from 10.9% in 2006 to 2.7% in 2015, and the state's health insurance market remained stable. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) built upon Romneycare's framework, and the ACA's implementation has been associated with a reduction in premiums for many Americans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that Seneca Jones Timber Co. has shifted to using second-generation trees and that most mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years.

Without concrete data or references, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible source indicating that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has proposed a budget that includes selling off Wisconsin's state parks. Walker's budget proposals typically focus on other areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, but there is no evidence to suggest that selling off state parks is part of his agenda.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, the process for selecting delegates to the Republican National Convention is determined by state party rules and does not involve the chairman of the party appointing delegates. Instead, delegates are typically selected through a process of primaries, caucuses, or other state-specific methods. The chairman of the party may have influence, but they do not have the authority to appoint delegates.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Perry failed to involve border sheriffs in developing plans to prevent violence in their communities is false. In fact, Gov. Rick Perry has been actively involved in working with local law enforcement, including border sheriffs, to address border security and violence. He has supported initiatives such as the Secure Texas Task Force, which includes representatives from various law enforcement agencies, including border sheriffs. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 14, 1935. At that time, the average life expectancy for men was around 59 years and for women around 62 years.

Alice Rivlin has publicly stated that she supports the stimulus bill and believes it is necessary to help the economy. She has also criticized those who argue against it. Therefore, the claim that she said the stimulus bill won't stimulate the economy is a misrepresentation of her actual views.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was a significant piece of legislation passed in 2010. It aimed to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance, expand Medicaid, and reduce the number of uninsured Americans. The claim about support for the Affordable Care Act can vary depending on the specific context and the time period being discussed. However, as of my last update in October 2023, the ACA has had varying levels of support and opposition from different political parties and the public. The support for the ACA has been a contentious issue, with some people praising its provisions and others criticizing it.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true, as the Affordable Care Act has had support from various groups and individuals, although the level and nature of this support have varied over time.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Tim Kaine, a former U.S. Senator and Governor of Virginia, has been accused of appointing a radical jihadi to the Virginia Immigration Commission. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The individual in question, Ali Al-Akhras, is a Muslim community activist and has been involved in various community initiatives, but there is no evidence to suggest that he is a ""radical jihadi"" or that he was appointed to the commission in exchange for campaign contributions. The claim appears to be a misinformation campaign.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we are experiencing the worst economic recovery America has ever had is subjective and depends on the specific metrics and timeframes used for comparison. While the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant economic disruption, the recovery has been swift in many ways, with the U.S. economy rebounding quickly after the initial downturn. However, it's important to note that the recovery has been uneven, with some sectors and regions recovering more slowly than others. Therefore, the claim that it is the ""worst"" recovery is not universally accepted and depends on the perspective and criteria used for evaluation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that New Jersey's job growth in May represents 25 percent of all the jobs created in the country. To verify this, we need to compare the number of jobs created in New Jersey with the total number of jobs created in the United States. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, New Jersey added 10,000 jobs in May 2023, while the United States added 375,000 jobs in the same period. To find the percentage, we calculate (10,000 / 375,000) * 100 = 2.66%. This is significantly less than 25%, so the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Obama in 2010. The primary goal of the ACA was to increase access to affordable health insurance for Americans. While the law has had mixed results, it has indeed brought down the costs for many Americans through various provisions such as subsidies for low- and middle-income individuals, expansion of Medicaid, and the requirement for insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. Therefore, the claim that ""President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs for average Americans"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. A trade war, which involves countries imposing tariffs or other barriers to trade with each other, can indeed have significant economic impacts. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which was implemented during the Great Depression, is often cited as an example of how protectionist trade policies can exacerbate economic downturns. The act led to a significant increase in tariffs, which reduced international trade and contributed to the length and severity of the Great Depression.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that China is practicing how to blow up our satellites is a misinterpretation of a real event. In 2021, China conducted an anti-satellite (ASAT) test, which involved the destruction of one of its own satellites. This test was not directed at any other country's satellites, including those of the United States. The test was condemned internationally due to the creation of space debris and the potential threat to other satellites. The claim that China is practicing to blow up our satellites is false and misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) is a non-profit organization that advocates for lower taxes. Their pledge typically relates to opposing new taxes or advocating for tax cuts. However, the claim that the ATR pledge relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action is not accurate. The ATR's pledge is more about opposing new taxes rather than supporting them. Therefore, the claim is false.

The amount a couple contributes to Medicare over their lifetimes is not a fixed number, and the benefits they receive are also not a fixed amount.

"Explanation: The claim about Rhode Island having the worst maintained bridges and the second worst maintained roads in the United States is not accurate. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2021 Infrastructure Report Card, Rhode Island's bridges are in fair condition, with a grade of C-. While the state's roads are in poor condition, with a grade of D-, it is not the second worst in the country. Alaska has the worst maintained roads, with a grade of D-, and Rhode Island ranks 40th in the nation for road conditions. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a specific database used by police to look up wanted suspects excludes certain warrants issued by Atlanta Municipal Court.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin road signs have always been made in Wisconsin and that Scott Walker is outsourcing them to an out-of-state company and paying more money for them is false. Wisconsin has indeed historically produced road signs within the state, but there have been instances where the state has outsourced the production to other states or companies. However, the claim that Scott Walker specifically did this and paid more money for them is not supported by reliable sources. The claim is a mix of true and false information, but the specific allegation about Scott Walker is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there haven't been tax cuts for the rich in Rhode Island is false. In 2019, Rhode Island implemented a tax cut that primarily benefited higher-income individuals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On a timetable to withdraw from Iraq"" is a reference to the U.S. military's withdrawal from Iraq, which was part of the U.S. strategy following the 2003 invasion.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from Wisconsin is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total nonfarm employment in the U.S. increased by 212,000 jobs in June 2022. Wisconsin's job growth was 10,000 jobs, which is approximately 4.7% of the total U.S. job growth. Therefore, the claim that over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from Wisconsin is an exaggeration and is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island's legislature is the strongest in the country is not accurate. The strength of a legislature is typically measured by factors such as the number of bills passed, the influence of the legislature on national policy, and the effectiveness of its lawmaking processes. Rhode Island's legislature is relatively small and has a lower profile compared to larger states like California or Texas, which have more significant impacts on national policy and have larger legislative bodies. Therefore, it is not accurate to describe Rhode Island's legislature as the strongest in the country.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that only 49 out of 3,000 faculty members at Texas A&M University brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead over the past five years is not accurate. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of a specific study or report. It is important to note that the majority of faculty members at any university are not expected to generate revenue to cover their salaries and overhead costs. Instead, they rely on institutional funding, grants, and other sources of income.

"Explanation: The claim that Mitch McConnell voted to raise Medicare costs for a current Kentucky senior by $6,000 is false. Medicare costs are determined by the federal government and are not directly influenced by individual senators' votes. Medicare benefits and costs are set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) based on federal laws and regulations, not by individual senators' votes. Therefore, it is not accurate to attribute a specific increase in Medicare costs to a single senator's vote.

"Explanation: The claim that Texas children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching is false. Teacher training and preparation are essential components of becoming a certified educator. In Texas, as in most states, teachers must complete a teacher preparation program, pass state certification exams, and often have student teaching experience before they can teach in a classroom. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a teacher would be hired without any teaching practice.

"Explanation: The claim that the conviction rate is almost exactly the same for whites and blacks who commit murder is not accurate. Studies have shown that there are significant racial disparities in the criminal justice system, including in murder cases.

This disparity is often attributed to a combination of factors, including implicit bias, differential treatment by law enforcement, and disparities in plea bargaining.

"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, requires members of Congress to abide by the same rules as other Americans. This includes the requirement to purchase health insurance through the federal health insurance marketplace. However, members of Congress have the option to choose a plan from the federal marketplace or a plan from their state's marketplace. They also have the option to purchase a plan from the federal marketplace that is subsidized by the government. This is similar to the subsidies available to other Americans who purchase plans through the federal marketplace.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is a mixture of true and false statements. Let's break it down:

1. **Business Income Tax**: Sen. Steve Ogden has been a vocal opponent of the business income tax, but he was not the driving force behind it. The tax was implemented as part of a broader tax reform package.

While it is true that the Clean Power Plan, a key policy of the Obama administration, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, including those that burn coal, the impact on jobs was not as straightforward as the claim suggests. The Clean Power Plan was designed to promote cleaner energy sources and reduce the environmental impact of coal, but it also aimed to create new jobs in renewable energy sectors. Additionally, the claim does not account for the broader economic factors that contribute to job losses in any industry. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the response to a major snow event in Atlanta to the response to a major earthquake in Kansas City, Mo. This is a false comparison because snow events and earthquakes are fundamentally different types of natural disasters.

"Explanation: The claim that Governor Scott Walker took away $1.6 billion from schools and handed it off as over $2 billion in tax breaks to the rich is a simplification and misrepresentation of the actual policies and their impacts. The $1.6 billion figure is a result of Walker's budget cuts, which included reductions in education funding. However, the $2 billion figure for tax breaks is an exaggeration. Walker's tax policies did include cuts and reforms, but the total amount of tax breaks provided was not $2 billion. The claim also implies a direct transfer of funds from schools to the wealthy, which is not accurate. The budget cuts and tax policies were part of a broader economic strategy that had various impacts on different sectors of the economy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government can cut all of the non-military discretionary spending and not balance the budget is false. Non-military discretionary spending includes programs like education, healthcare, and social services. Cutting all of this spending would significantly impact the economy and the lives of many Americans. Additionally, the federal government's budget is influenced by many factors, including mandatory spending (like Social Security and Medicare) and revenue from taxes. Simply cutting discretionary spending does not guarantee a balanced budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that people in Galveston, Texas, have been allowed to privatize part of their Social Security and are building wealth is false. Social Security is a federal program managed by the U.S. government, and there is no provision for individuals to privatize their benefits.

Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that people in Galveston or elsewhere have been able to build wealth through privatizing their Social Security benefits.

"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama had the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress is false. The U.S. Constitution grants the power to declare war to Congress, not the President. While the President has the authority to use military force in response to an imminent threat or in self-defense, he does not have the authority to initiate a war without congressional approval. In the case of the 2013 Syria strike, President Obama did not have the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010, does not require a 20 percent down payment to buy a house. The law primarily focuses on financial regulations and consumer protection, but it does not set specific requirements for down payments on mortgages. The minimum down payment required for a mortgage is typically set by the lender or the type of loan, not by the Dodd-Frank Act.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no publicly available record or database that tracks the voting records of politicians or public figures for organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) or the American Legion. These organizations do not publicly disclose the voting records of their members, and such information is not typically made available to the public. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the claim that the individual has a perfect voting record from these organizations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Barack Obama, during his time as a U.S. Senator and later as President, has had a mixed record on criminal justice reform. While he has supported some measures to reduce penalties for non-violent offenders, he has also supported tougher penalties for certain crimes. For instance, he signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which included provisions for mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. Therefore, the claim that he has consistently voted against tougher penalties for criminals is false.

While tort reform can potentially make the medical profession more attractive by reducing the risk of lawsuits, the specific number of 21,000 doctors gained due to tort reform is not supported by reliable data or studies. The claim appears to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the effects of tort reform on the medical workforce in Texas.

"Explanation: The claim that ""most private sector jobs in the history of Buffalo exist in Buffalo today"" is not accurate. While Buffalo has seen significant economic growth and development in recent years, it is not true that most private sector jobs from its history still exist today.

Additionally, new jobs have been created in different sectors, which means the job market has evolved over time.

"Explanation: The claim that Alex Jones said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there is false. Alex Jones has made controversial and false statements about the Sandy Hook shooting, but the claim that he said the victims were child actors and no one was killed is a specific misrepresentation of his statements. Multiple independent investigations and reports have confirmed that the Sandy Hook shooting was a real event, and the victims were indeed children who were killed.

Therefore, the claim that Texas has never elected a Latina to Congress is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim that there are half a million fewer government employees now than when President Barack Obama took office is based on a comparison of the number of federal employees in 2009 and 2021. According to the Office of Personnel Management, the number of federal employees in January 2009 was approximately 2,094,000, while in January 2021, it was approximately 2,097,000. This means there are actually more federal employees now than when Obama took office, not fewer.

"Explanation: The claim that one-third of the gasoline is purchased by out-of-state people in Virginia is not supported by any reliable data or sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal tax code has loopholes that are giving incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas is partially true. While there are certain tax provisions that can incentivize companies to move operations overseas, such as the Foreign Tax Credit, these provisions are not specifically designed to encourage job offshoring. The primary goal of these provisions is to prevent double taxation of foreign income. Additionally, the U.S. tax code includes provisions like the GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income) tax, which aims to discourage companies from shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Therefore, while there are tax incentives that can indirectly influence job offshoring, it is not accurate to say that the tax code has loopholes specifically designed to incentivize this practice.

1. **Data Source**: Check reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or the U.S. Census Bureau for the most recent job growth data.
2. **Comparison**: Compare Wisconsin's job growth rate with other Midwest states over the past year.
3. **Ranking**: Determine if Wisconsin indeed ranked third in job growth among Midwest states.

Since I don't have the specific data for the last year, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, if you can provide the specific data or sources, I can help you verify the claim.

Answer: [0/1] (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
"Explanation: The claim that FIFA pressured Brazil into passing a so-called Budweiser bill, allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums, is false.

Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that FIFA pressured Brazil to pass such a law.

"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama put a stop sign against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska, is false. While President Obama did implement policies that restricted oil drilling and exploration in certain areas, such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf, he did not put a complete stop sign against all forms of oil drilling and exploration. His policies were part of a broader strategy to balance environmental concerns with energy production.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Jeb Bush ""flip-flop-flip(ped)"" on immigration is a reference to his changing positions on immigration policies over time. Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida and son of former President George H.W. Bush, has indeed shifted his stance on immigration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the overall crime decline in the United States is significantly influenced by the crime decline in New York City. While it is true that New York City has experienced a notable decrease in crime, it is not accurate to say that the national crime decline would be ""fairly small"" if it weren't for this. The United States has seen a general trend of crime decline over the past few decades, with many cities and states contributing to this trend. Therefore, the claim overstates the influence of New York City's crime decline on the national trend.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Senate immigration bill would make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI, with one agent every 250 feet, is an exaggeration and not accurate. The bill, known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did propose an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents, but it did not specify a ratio that would make the Border Patrol larger than the FBI. The FBI has approximately 14,000 special agents, while the Border Patrol has around 20,000 agents. The claim of having one agent every 250 feet is a misrepresentation of the bill's provisions.

The claim misrepresents the purpose and impact of the Clean Power Plan.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Mike Huckabee, as governor of Arkansas, granted 1,033 pardons and commutations, which is more than the previous three governors combined. This claim is false because it is not supported by accurate historical data. According to the Arkansas Department of Corrections, Mike Huckabee granted 1,033 pardons and commutations during his term, but this number is not significantly more than the combined total of the previous three governors. The claim exaggerates the number of clemencies granted by Huckabee.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the proposed transportation bill could be the largest tax increase in Georgia history is difficult to verify without specific details about the bill and the tax increases it proposes.

"Explanation: The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as the stimulus bill, was designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs. While it did not immediately solve the unemployment crisis, it did create or save millions of jobs.

"Explanation: Ronald Reagan was a member of the Democratic Party before he switched to the Republican Party. He was a Democrat from 1932 to 1962, serving as the Governor of California from 1967 to 1975 as a Republican. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that $125 billion can be saved by not giving out money to Medicare recipients who do not exist for procedures that did not happen. This claim is false because it oversimplifies the issue and ignores the complexities of fraud detection and prevention in healthcare systems. Medicare fraud is a serious issue, but the claim's suggestion that a significant portion of Medicare spending is fraudulent is not supported by evidence. The claim also implies that all non-existent recipients and procedures are fraudulent, which is not accurate. Medicare has systems in place to detect and prevent fraud, and the claim's figure of $125 billion is not based on reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the University of Wisconsin System will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America because of a cap on tuition tied to inflation is not accurate. While the University of Wisconsin System has implemented a tuition freeze or a cap on tuition increases tied to inflation, this does not necessarily make it the most affordable campus in America. Affordability can vary greatly depending on factors such as state funding, scholarships, and financial aid available to students. Additionally, the claim that it will be ""much more affordable"" is subjective and not supported by specific data or comparisons with other institutions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On immigration reform"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide specific information or context that can be verified.

"Explanation: The claim that the nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone XL is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs is not accurate. The Keystone XL pipeline project was initially proposed in 2008 and faced numerous delays due to environmental concerns and regulatory processes. However, the actual impact on job creation is complex and varies depending on the source and methodology used. While some studies suggest that the pipeline could create jobs, others argue that the overall economic impact is minimal. The claim of 100,000 jobs lost due to the delay is not supported by credible evidence.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that Oregon's high minimum wage is the reason why restaurants employed fewer workers by 2011. However, correlation does not imply causation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Climatic Research Unit (CRU) e-mails, often referred to as ""Climategate,"" were a series of hacked e-mails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. The e-mails were leaked in 2009 and sparked controversy, with some claiming they showed evidence of scientific misconduct or manipulation of data. However, multiple independent investigations, including those by the Royal Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and the U.S. House of Representatives, found no evidence of scientific misconduct or manipulation of data. The e-mails did not debunk the science behind climate change; they merely showed that scientists were engaged in normal scientific practices, such as discussing data and methods, and occasionally expressing frustration with the process of peer review and public communication. Therefore, the claim that the CRU e-mails show that the science behind climate change has been debunked is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""just about half of rural hospitals operate in the red in Virginia"" is difficult to verify without specific data or sources. However, it is known that rural hospitals often face financial challenges due to lower patient volumes, higher costs, and limited access to specialized care. Therefore, it is plausible that a significant number of rural hospitals in Virginia may operate at a loss. Without concrete data, it is challenging to definitively say whether exactly half of them are in the red.

"Explanation: The claim that the numbers of people who support Obamacare and like it have been steadily dropping is not accurate. According to various polls and surveys, public opinion on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has been relatively stable over time.

For instance, a 2021 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 56% of Americans approved of the Affordable Care Act, which is similar to the levels of support seen in previous years.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Redistricting plans are typically drawn by state legislatures and are subject to legal and political scrutiny. The claim that a specific individual, such as Nancy Nusbaum, was cut out of her state Senate district by a half a block is not a standard way to describe redistricting changes and lacks specific details that would allow for verification. Additionally, redistricting plans are usually announced and discussed publicly, and such a specific claim would likely have been reported by multiple sources if it were true.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Former U.S. President Barack Obama did not choose to deny the anti-Semitic motivation of the attack on a kosher Jewish grocery in Paris. In fact, he publicly condemned the attack and acknowledged the anti-Semitic nature of it. He stated, ""The attack on the kosher grocery store in Paris was an attack on the Jewish community, and it was an attack on the values that we share."" This statement was made in a press conference following the attack.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that gas prices have never been higher is true. As of my last update in October 2023, gas prices have reached record highs in many regions around the world. Additionally, Exxon Mobil's profits have also been high due to the increased demand for energy and the high prices of oil and gas. Therefore, the claim that Exxon Mobil's profits have never been higher is also true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that the individual did not vote for tax increases as a member of the West Miami City Commission. To verify this claim, I would need to check the official records of the West Miami City Commission meetings and the voting records of the individual in question.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: Margaret Sanger, the birth control pioneer, was a controversial figure due to her views on eugenics. She believed in the idea of ""positive eugenics,"" which aimed to improve the human race by encouraging reproduction among those deemed ""fit"" and discouraging reproduction among those deemed ""unfit."" However, her views were not directed at eliminating specific groups of people, but rather at promoting the idea of selective reproduction. The claim that Sanger believed people like ""me"" should be eliminated is a misinterpretation of her views and is not supported by historical evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island was one of the first states in the union to pass a voter ID bill is false. While Rhode Island has implemented voter ID laws, it was not one of the first states to do so. The first state to pass a voter ID law was Georgia in 2005. Rhode Island's voter ID law was enacted in 2011.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing job creation during the Obama administration to the Reagan recovery. The Reagan recovery refers to the economic recovery that occurred during the 1980s, following the recession of 1980-1981. The claim suggests that Obama created more private-sector jobs in the past 27 months than Reagan did during his recovery period. However, the claim does not specify the exact time frame for the 27 months or the specific period of the Reagan recovery being compared. Without clear and specific data for both periods, it is not possible to accurately compare the job creation figures. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that states with the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates is not entirely accurate. While it is true that states with higher rates of gun ownership tend to have higher rates of gun-related suicides, this does not mean that gun ownership is the sole or primary factor contributing to suicide rates. Other factors such as mental health, socioeconomic conditions, and cultural attitudes towards guns and suicide also play significant roles. Therefore, the claim oversimplifies the issue and does not account for the complex interplay of various factors.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a politician, and it is a statement about their past actions and future intentions. However, without specific evidence or context, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Earmarks are a form of pork-barrel spending, and politicians often deny using them to maintain their image. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The Open Meetings Act is a law that requires public bodies to hold open meetings and provide notice of those meetings to the public. It applies to all meetings of public bodies, including those involving the governor. Therefore, the claim that a meeting involving the governor is not covered by the Open Meetings Act is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Maureen Dowd's column quotes Obama as having received suspicious contributions from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and China is false. Maureen Dowd is a well-known columnist for The New York Times, but her columns do not contain such a claim. Additionally, there is no evidence to support that Barack Obama received suspicious contributions from these countries during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 94 percent of Marco Rubio's constituents support a universal background check is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific source or data cited to support this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of this statement without additional evidence.

"Explanation: The claim that nobody has ever escaped from a federal ""supermax"" prison is false. There have been several instances of prisoners escaping from these facilities. For example, in 2019, a prisoner named David Sweat escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, which is a high-security prison. Additionally, in 2015, two prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, escaped from the ADX Florence prison in Colorado, which is a federal ""supermax"" prison. These incidents demonstrate that escapes from federal ""supermax"" prisons are not unprecedented.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The bill in question is the ""Endless Frontier Act,"" which was introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2021. The bill does not create a $50 billion slush fund. Instead, it establishes a new agency, the National Science and Technology Council, to coordinate federal research and development efforts. The bill also includes provisions for funding research and development in various fields, but it does not create a fund that can be used for virtually any purpose by the Treasury Secretary.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama and the Democrats have ""proposed a tax for not having health insurance"" is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Obama, does include a provision for a penalty for not having health insurance, but it is not a tax. The penalty is often referred to as the ""individual mandate"" and is designed to encourage people to obtain health insurance. The penalty is not a tax in the traditional sense and is not collected by the IRS in the same way as taxes are.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that animal abuse is often an indicative trait of future acts of violence against humans is supported by several studies and research findings. Animal abuse is often considered a ""red flag"" behavior, as it can indicate a pattern of violent behavior. This is because the perpetrator may not differentiate between humans and animals, and the abuse of animals can be a precursor to abuse against humans. However, it's important to note that not all individuals who abuse animals will go on to abuse humans, and the correlation is not absolute.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was a United States military policy that prohibited open discussion of sexual orientation in the military. The policy was repealed in 2011, and it is not accurate to say that all those who do not answer directly to the president have said that repealing it was a terrible idea. The claim is a generalization and does not reflect the diverse opinions of individuals who may or may not have been directly involved in the policy's repeal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There have been Democratic women in Congress from New Jersey in recent decades. For example, Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democratic representative from New Jersey's 12th congressional district, has been serving since 2015. Therefore, the claim that there has not been a Democratic woman in Congress from New Jersey in almost four decades is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration increased the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes by 70 percent is false. While it is true that the Obama administration deported a large number of immigrants, including those convicted of crimes, the increase in deportations was not 70 percent. The actual increase was around 25 percent from 2009 to 2016. This misrepresentation of the data is a common tactic used to spread misinformation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The 10 richest counties in the United States are not all surrounding Washington, D.C. While some of the wealthiest counties are in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, such as Loudoun County, Virginia, and Fairfax County, Virginia, there are also wealthy counties in other parts of the country, such as Marin County, California, and Santa Clara County, California.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Washington has run out of money about halfway through fiscal year 2009 is false. The U.S. federal government does not ""run out of money"" in the sense that it cannot pay its bills. The federal government has the ability to borrow money to meet its obligations. In 2009, the U.S. government did face significant financial challenges due to the Great Recession, but it did not run out of money.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the person has tried over 100 jury cases in Travis County courts is not verifiable without additional context or evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Panasonic stayed in New Jersey because of the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant (BRRAG) program is false. Panasonic's decision to stay in New Jersey was primarily driven by the company's long-term strategic plans and the state's business-friendly environment, rather than the BRRAG program. The BRRAG program is a state incentive program designed to help businesses relocate to New Jersey, but it is not the primary reason for Panasonic's decision to remain in the state.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay"" is false. Federal employees are generally not covered by collective bargaining agreements, but they do have collective bargaining rights for certain benefits and pay. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) allows federal employees to bargain collectively over certain issues, including benefits and pay, but the specifics of what can be bargained over are limited compared to private sector employees. Therefore, the claim is misleading as it suggests that no federal employees have collective bargaining rights, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about offshore oil drilling is a general statement and does not provide specific information that can be verified as true or false. Offshore oil drilling is a well-documented and widely practiced industry, but the claim itself is too broad to be evaluated as true or false without additional context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Same-day voter registration allows individuals to register to vote and cast their ballot on the same day. This process is designed to make voting more accessible and convenient for those who may not have previously registered. Therefore, it is possible for people to walk in and vote on the same day they register.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Rhode Island has consistently ranked among the states with the highest rates of substance abuse, including opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder. However, it's important to note that the ranking can change from year to year, and other states may also have high rates of substance abuse. Therefore, while Rhode Island has historically had high rates of substance abuse, it is not accurate to say that it continues to have the highest rates in the country without specifying the time period and comparing it to other states.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered the ocean closed is clearly false. Presidents do not have the authority to close the ocean, and such a statement is not a part of any official policy or action taken by the Obama administration. This claim appears to be a humorous or satirical statement, often used to describe a situation where someone has made a ridiculous or extreme claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario that assumes the immediate opening of a gas reserve in Alaska and its impact on gas prices within five years. However, the actual impact of such a decision on gas prices is influenced by numerous factors, including market demand, supply chain logistics, geopolitical events, and regulatory policies. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific studies or data to support the assertion that gas prices would reach $2 per gallon within five years. Therefore, the claim is speculative and lacks concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about John McCain's past and present positions on the payroll tax. The statement suggests that McCain previously expressed openness to lifting the cap on the payroll tax but is now criticizing someone else for holding the same position. This claim is true because it accurately reflects McCain's past and present stances on the issue.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama added $16 trillion to the national debt is false. While it is true that the national debt increased significantly during his presidency, the total increase was approximately $10 trillion, not $16 trillion. This misinformation often arises from confusion between the national debt and the federal deficit, which is the annual increase in the debt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Saudi Arabia has been involved in a military campaign in Yemen against the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran. This conflict has been ongoing since 2015 and has been a significant focus of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy. While Saudi Arabia has also been involved in efforts to combat ISIS, the focus on the Yemen conflict has been more prominent.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has publicly stated that she supports comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. However, she has not explicitly advocated for ""open borders"" in the sense of unrestricted immigration. Her stance is more nuanced and focuses on reforming the immigration system rather than advocating for completely open borders.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution grants the President the authority to use military force in certain circumstances, such as when there is an actual or imminent threat to the nation. However, the President must typically obtain authorization from Congress for military actions that do not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat. Unilateral military attacks without such authorization are not consistent with the U.S. Constitution and legal precedent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Homosexuality is no longer a felony in any state in the U.S. The Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) struck down laws that criminalized sodomy, including those that targeted homosexuality. Since then, all states have repealed such laws. Therefore, the claim that homosexuality remains a felony in some states is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a tax plan proposed by a candidate, and it's not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim without additional context or specific details about the tax plan. The claim itself is a statement made by a candidate, and without knowing the specifics of the plan or the calculations behind it, it's impossible to determine if it would indeed leave the federal government with a $1.1 trillion hole.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government borrows money to fund its operations, but this does not mean that the money would be available for entrepreneurs and businesses if the government did not borrow. The money borrowed by the government is used to pay for government services, infrastructure, and other expenses. If the government did not borrow, it would likely have to raise taxes or cut spending to balance its budget, which could have negative effects on the economy. Additionally, the money borrowed by the government is not directly available for entrepreneurs and businesses to use for job creation and business expansion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the person started criticizing the war in Iraq before Barack Obama did is false. Barack Obama was a vocal critic of the Iraq War before he became President. He publicly opposed the war in 2002 and 2003, well before he was elected in 2008. Therefore, the claim that someone else started criticizing the war in Iraq before Obama is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Members of Congress have access to a different health insurance plan than other federal employees. Congress members and their families are eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a comprehensive health insurance plan. However, the specific plans and benefits available to members of Congress are different from those available to other federal employees. For instance, members of Congress have access to a more extensive network of providers and may have different cost-sharing arrangements.

Answer: 0"
"Claim: Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country.

Explanation: Georgia's ballot access laws are indeed considered among the most restrictive in the country. The state requires candidates to collect a significant number of signatures to qualify for the ballot, and the signature requirements are higher than in many other states. Additionally, Georgia has strict rules regarding the timing and placement of signature collection efforts. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time is not accurate. While Sherrod Brown and Barack Obama are both Democrats, their voting records are not identical. The claim of a 95% agreement rate is an exaggeration. In reality, their voting records show a high level of agreement, but not to the extent of 95%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sidney Blumenthal wrote that the Benghazi attack was almost certainly preventable is false. Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton aide, did not write any such statement. The claim is a misinterpretation of Blumenthal's emails, which were released during the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails did not attribute the preventability of the Benghazi attack to Hillary Clinton or the State Department. The claim is a distortion of the facts and is not supported by any credible evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The U.S. Congress did indeed raise the national debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion in December 2021. Additionally, the budget proposed by the Biden administration for the fiscal year 2022 includes a projected deficit of over $5 trillion over the next five years.

"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold received a memo in 2009 outlining veteran harm at a Wisconsin VA facility and nothing was done is false. There is no evidence to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that she is saving ratepayers $6 million/year is not verifiable without additional context or evidence. The statement could be a part of a political campaign or a press release, but without specific details or sources, it is impossible to confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that recall organizers started their website last November and began work on their effort before he even took office. This claim is false because recall efforts typically begin after a politician takes office, not before. Recall efforts are usually initiated in response to a politician's actions or policies, which would not have been in place before they took office.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general trend and correlation, but it lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that distracted driving, such as texting, is the primary cause of the rise in traffic deaths on Georgia roadways this year. While distracted driving is a significant factor in traffic accidents, it is not the only cause, and the claim does not provide specific data to support the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about homeowners across Ohio signing mineral rights agreements and over a billion dollars worth of leases being signed to date is not verifiable with the information provided. Mineral rights agreements are typically complex legal documents that involve specific properties and are not typically aggregated into a single figure for an entire state. Without specific sources or data to back up the claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution requires a supermajority of 60 senators to break a filibuster, but this is not the first time it has been required. The 60-vote threshold has been used in various instances throughout history, including during the Obama administration and the Trump administration. The claim that this is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The State of Texas does use the E-Verify system to determine the employment eligibility of individuals. E-Verify is a web-based system that allows employers to verify the employment eligibility of their employees. Texas has implemented E-Verify as a requirement for certain employers, and it is used to ensure that employees are legally authorized to work in the United States.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Texas General Land Office (GLO) does not earn money from wind leases that haven't produced energy. The GLO manages the state's land and mineral rights, but it does not generate revenue from leases that do not produce energy. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the GLO's role and responsibilities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""a couple of hundred American cities are infested by members of the Mexican cartels"" is an exaggeration. While it is true that Mexican cartels have a presence in some U.S. cities, the extent of their influence and the number of cities affected are often overstated. The U.S. Department of Justice and other law enforcement agencies have reported that cartels operate in a limited number of cities, primarily along the U.S.-Mexico border and in major metropolitan areas. The term ""infested"" suggests a widespread and significant presence, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens is not accurate. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, in 2019, 1,650 murders were reported in Texas, and only 10 percent of these were attributed to illegal immigrants. This information is based on data from the Texas Department of Public Safety and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there are very few women and children among Syrian refugees and migrants coming into Europe is not accurate. In reality, the gender distribution among Syrian refugees is roughly equal, with about 50% being women and 50% being children. The perception of fewer women and children may be due to the fact that men are often the ones making the journey first to establish a foothold in Europe, while women and children follow later. Additionally, the media often focuses on the male refugees, which can create a skewed perception.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Senator Robert Hurt voted for a bill that raised electric rates seven times is not accurate. Senator Hurt has not voted for such a bill. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a false statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a legislative debate on airport pat-down procedures initiated federal changes in security procedures is true. In 2013, there was a significant debate in the U.S. Congress about the use of pat-downs and other security procedures at airports, following the incident of a passenger who was subjected to a pat-down after being caught with a knife. This debate led to changes in the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) procedures, including the use of advanced imaging technology and the implementation of the ""Known Crew Member"" program. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is a long-standing conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked. Abedin has consistently denied any such ties, and there is no credible evidence to support the claim. The Muslim Brotherhood is a controversial organization, and its members have been accused of various activities, but there is no evidence to suggest that Abedin is involved with them.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The amount of money a person takes home after taxes depends on various factors such as the tax rate, deductions, and credits. The claim suggests a flat reduction of $125,000 from $250,000, which is not accurate. The actual take-home pay would be calculated based on the individual's tax bracket and other deductions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the funding sources of two political campaigns, the Doherty Campaign and the Cicilline Campaign. The claim states that the Doherty Campaign is funded mostly by individual donors, while the Cicilline Campaign relies on big PACs. To verify this claim, one would need to look at the campaign finance reports for both campaigns. However, without specific data, it is not possible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified with the given information.)"
"Explanation: The claim that the president and vice president cannot be from the same state is false. There is no constitutional or legal restriction that prevents the president and vice president from being from the same state. In fact, there have been instances where both the president and vice president were from the same state. For example, in 1993, both President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were from Tennessee.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a political figure, suggesting that they campaigned on the proposals in the budget repair bill for Wisconsin. This claim is subjective and depends on the specific proposals and the extent to which they were emphasized during the campaign. Without specific details about the proposals and the campaign, it is difficult to verify the claim's accuracy. However, the statement ""Anybody who says they are shocked on this has been asleep for the past two years"" suggests that the proposals were well-known and discussed during the campaign.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true based on the statement that the proposals were well-known and discussed during the campaign.)"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a former mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, and it includes specific references to various publications and years. However, the claim is not verifiable through reliable sources. USA Today, Money Magazine, and All Cities Almanac are real publications, but the specific claims made about Providence's ranking and safety are not substantiated by any credible sources. Therefore, the claim cannot be independently verified as true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic that is not supported by reliable sources. The Guttmacher Institute, which is a leading research and policy organization on reproductive health, reports that major complications from abortion are rare. According to their data, the rate of major complications from abortion is less than 0.1% (1 in 1,000). The claim of 2 to 3 Texas women per week having major complications and 10 women per week seeking help at an ER after an abortion is not supported by credible sources and appears to be an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible source or evidence provided to support the claim that 99 people from the Department of Taxation were let go the next day after the governor announced his jobs budget. This information is not widely reported or verified by reliable news outlets.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is a tool used by local governments to fund infrastructure and development projects. When a TIF district is created, the property taxes generated within that district are used to fund the project. The general fund is not directly impacted by TIF because the taxes are specifically allocated to the project. Therefore, the claim that TIF funding will take funds from the general fund for Pinellas County or the city of St. Pete is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion every year is often cited but is not accurate. The actual economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy is more complex and varies by year. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy is estimated to be around $200 billion to $250 billion annually, not $100 billion. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that criminals have learned how to spy on Americans by hacking into home computers and looking through video cameras attached to screens is a common misconception. While it is true that hackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to computers and use webcams, the claim that this is a widespread or common practice among criminals is not supported by evidence. Most cybersecurity experts advise against using webcams for security purposes due to the risk of hacking, but this does not mean that criminals are actively spying on Americans through this method.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Texas public school funding grew three times the rate of enrollment from 2002 to 2012. To verify this, we need to look at the actual data for both funding and enrollment during this period. According to the Texas Education Agency, the total funding for public schools in Texas increased from $20.4 billion in 2002 to $47.7 billion in 2012. Meanwhile, the student enrollment increased from 3.5 million to 4.8 million during the same period. The growth rate of funding was approximately 135% (from $20.4 billion to $47.7 billion), while the growth rate of enrollment was approximately 42% (from 3.5 million to 4.8 million). Therefore, the funding did not grow three times the rate of enrollment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ohio has lost over 100,000 jobs since the stimulus package was passed is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Ohio's unemployment rate has been decreasing since the implementation of the stimulus package. As of the latest data, Ohio's unemployment rate has been below 5%, indicating a recovery in the job market. Therefore, the claim that Ohio has lost over 100,000 jobs is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Jim Doyle served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2003 to 2011, and Mary Burke served as the Secretary of Commerce from 2011 to 2013. The claim that Wisconsin saw billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones, and garbage during this period is not accurate. There were no significant tax hikes on these items during their tenure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Connie Mack wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation to get $29 million in stimulus for his congressional district is false. There is no evidence or record of such a letter or request.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Apple's CEO Tim Cook will not do business with Indiana is false. Apple has not announced any such policy, and there is no evidence to suggest that Tim Cook or Apple has taken any action to boycott Indiana. Apple has operations and stores in Indiana, and the company has not made any public statements indicating a change in their business practices regarding the state.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters is false. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders. It is calculated as the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy. While GDP can fluctuate and may even decrease in certain quarters, it is highly unlikely to be zero. Economic activity, even in the most severe economic downturns, does not cease entirely, and thus GDP would not be zero.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about job gains in New Jersey (McMansion State) since Chris Christie took office. It states that while there have been some job gains, they have lagged behind the nation as a whole and the states of New York and Connecticut. This claim is based on a comparison of job growth rates, which can be verified through official economic data sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or state-specific economic reports.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) did not estimate that 4.7 million Americans would lose their jobs if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed. The CEA's analysis of the ACA's impact on employment was more nuanced and did not predict a significant loss of jobs. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the CEA's findings.

Answer: 0"

Social Security is a government-run program that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible individuals. Privatization typically refers to the transfer of government services or assets to private entities.

"Explanation: The claim that Iran continues to pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons is a complex issue that has been subject to various interpretations and assessments. While Iran has been accused by some countries and organizations of pursuing nuclear weapons, it is important to note that Iran has consistently maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been monitoring Iran's nuclear activities, and while there have been concerns and disputes, the IAEA has not found conclusive evidence that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the claim that Iran continues to pursue nuclear weapons is not universally accepted as true by all objective observers.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton's health care plan from the 1990s, known as the Health Security Act, did not have a broader provision in favor of corporate right to back out of providing contraceptive coverage than the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision. In fact, the Health Security Act proposed a mandate for employers to provide contraceptive coverage, which was later challenged by Hobby Lobby in the Supreme Court. The Hobby Lobby decision, which was decided in 2014, allowed for-profit corporations to refuse to provide contraceptive coverage based on religious beliefs, which was not a provision in Clinton's 1990s plan.

The CBO's report stated that repealing the ACA would reduce federal spending by $145 billion over 10 years, not $95 billion in 2016. Additionally, repealing the ACA would likely increase the number of uninsured Americans, leading to higher costs for hospitals and other healthcare providers, which would offset any savings.

"Explanation: The claim that the pension system was funded at 100% in 2001 and 2002 is false.

According to the report, as of December 31, 2021, the U.S. had a public debt of $28.4 trillion.

"Explanation: The claim that the government wants to require farm tractor drivers to hold commercial drivers licenses even if they're just crossing a single public road is false. In the United States, for example, farm tractors are generally exempt from commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements, as they are not considered commercial vehicles. The CDL requirements typically apply to vehicles used for commercial purposes, such as transporting goods or passengers for hire. Farm tractors are primarily used for agricultural purposes and are not subject to the same regulations as commercial vehicles.

Job creation can vary significantly from year to year due to numerous factors such as economic cycles, industry-specific trends, and national economic conditions. While it is true that job creation can fluctuate, it is not accurate to say that it has consistently gotten worse each year during Walker's tenure as governor. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The Pentagon is indeed exempt from the federal law that requires all federal agencies to complete annual audits. This exemption is due to the complexity and size of the Pentagon's operations, which make it difficult to conduct a comprehensive audit.

"Explanation: The claim that we now have the greatest income inequality since the Great Depression is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources. According to these data, the income inequality in the United States has been increasing since the 1970s, with the top 1% of earners capturing a larger share of the total income. However, it is important to note that the Great Depression was a unique historical event with extreme economic conditions, and comparing current income inequality to that period requires careful consideration of the context and data sources.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Nevada lawmakers did not vote to allow teenaged boys to shower with teenaged girls in public school locker rooms. This misinformation has been circulating due to a misunderstanding of a bill that was introduced in 2019, which aimed to protect transgender students from discrimination. The bill did not allow boys to shower with girls, but rather aimed to ensure that transgender students could use the locker rooms that correspond to their gender identity. The bill was not passed and did not become law.

In 2018, Florida's Secretary of State, Ken Detzner, announced that 180,000 voters had been removed from the rolls due to a lack of recent voting activity. This was a routine process to maintain the accuracy of the voter rolls, not an attempt by Gov. Rick Scott to remove voters. The claim incorrectly attributes this action to Scott.

"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare is false. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to expand health insurance coverage, not reduce it. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the number of uninsured Floridians decreased from 2.5 million in 2013 to 1.3 million in 2019, which is a significant reduction. The claim of 300,000 Floridians losing their health insurance is not supported by reliable data.

The U.S. spends around $10,966 per capita, while the U.K. spends around $4,900 and France spends around $5,500.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act is a proposed law that would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The claim that the DREAM Act would give amnesty to over two million illegal aliens is an exaggeration. The DREAM Act would only apply to a subset of undocumented immigrants who meet specific criteria, such as having arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16 and having lived in the country continuously since that time. The exact number of beneficiaries is difficult to determine, but it is not accurate to say that it would apply to over two million people.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt"" is misleading.

The claim does not specify which administration or period is being referred to, but the overall statement is inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim that the measles vaccine does not cause autism is supported by extensive scientific research and consensus among the medical and scientific communities. Multiple studies have investigated the potential link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism, and none have found a causal relationship. The most famous study that initially suggested a link, published by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, was later retracted due to serious procedural errors, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, and ethical violations. The overwhelming consensus among scientists and health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: A tax on soda and juice drinks would indeed disproportionately affect low-income families in Philadelphia. This is because low-income families often rely more heavily on these beverages as part of their daily caloric intake, and a tax would increase their overall expenditure on food and drinks. Additionally, low-income families may not have access to healthier alternatives or may not be able to afford them, making the tax more burdensome for them.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that a citizen with a gun stopped the Clackamas Town Center shooting in 2012, Kip Kinkel's shooting at Thurston High School in 1998 was not stopped by a citizen with a gun.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police in New York in about 45 years"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) does indeed place the responsibility for cleanup and containment of oil spills primarily on the party responsible for the spill. This is often referred to as the ""polluter pays"" principle. The act requires the responsible party to take immediate action to prevent or minimize the discharge of oil and to provide for the cleanup of the oil. The Obama administration, like any other administration, would be bound by this law. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: FirstEnergys annual revenues are not greater than the GDP of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, or 15 African nations. The GDP of these countries and the revenues of FirstEnergy are not comparable in the same context. FirstEnergy is a U.S.-based electric utility company, while the GDP figures are for entire countries. The GDP of these countries is a measure of their total economic output, while FirstEnergy's revenues are a measure of its business performance. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that all legislative mail, from the content to the timing, is approved by the speaker's office is not entirely accurate. While the speaker's office may have some oversight or influence over legislative mail, it is not accurate to say that all aspects of it are approved by the speaker's office. The content and timing of legislative mail can be influenced by various factors, including the legislative agenda, the priorities of the speaker, and the input of other legislators and staff.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth"" is not accurate. According to various studies and reports, the number of Muslims who are radicalized or extremist is a small fraction of the global Muslim population. For instance, a 2019 Pew Research Center report estimated that about 13% of Muslims worldwide hold extremist views, which translates to around 200 million people. This is significantly less than the 800 million figure stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim that more than half of Muslims are radicalized is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplistic assumption that freezing spending at 2007 levels would automatically balance the budget and cut the national debt in half by 2020. However, this ignores several factors:
1. **Economic Growth**: The economy grows over time, and spending needs to grow with it to maintain services and infrastructure.
2. **Inflation**: Prices increase over time, so the value of money decreases. Therefore, spending needs to increase to maintain the same level of services.
3. **Demographic Changes**: Population growth and aging can increase spending on social services.
4. **Economic Downturns**: Economic crises, like the 2008 financial crisis, can lead to increased spending to stimulate the economy.

Given these factors, freezing spending at 2007 levels would not balance the budget or cut the national debt in half by 2020. The claim is therefore false.

The most recent example of a Supreme Court nominee being confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate during an election year is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's confirmation in 1993.

"Explanation: The claim that more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners is an overgeneralization and an exaggeration. While intimate partner violence is a serious issue, the actual number of women who die from such violence is lower.

This number is significantly lower than the claim of more than three women per day.

"Explanation: The claim that Medicaid has grown by 1,600 percent in the last 30 years in Virginia is misleading. While Medicaid enrollment has indeed increased significantly over time, a 1,600 percent growth rate is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicaid enrollment in Virginia has grown from approximately 1.2 million enrollees in 1990 to around 1.7 million enrollees in 2020. This represents a growth rate of about 42 percent, not 1,600 percent.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario where Proposition 1 is rejected. The cost of a new City-run criminal background check process would depend on various factors such as the scope of the checks, the number of people involved, and the efficiency of the process.

Therefore, the claim is speculative and lacks concrete evidence.

"Explanation: The claim that the tax changes in January 2023 are ""OBAMA TAX HIKES"" is false. The tax changes in question are part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law by President Trump, not President Obama.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax"" is based on a misinterpretation of a study by the Tax Policy Center. The study found that 47% of Americans do not pay federal income tax, but this does not mean they pay no tax at all. Many of these individuals are low-income earners who do not earn enough to owe federal income tax, but they may still pay other taxes such as payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare) or state and local taxes. Therefore, the claim is false.

Financial regulations are typically designed to prevent future crises and protect taxpayers from bearing the costs of bank failures.

"Explanation: The claim that the Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10 west of Houston, is the widest freeway in the world with up to 26 lanes, including frontage road lanes, is false. While the Katy Freeway is indeed one of the widest in the United States, it does not have 26 lanes. The maximum number of lanes on the Katy Freeway is 22, including frontage road lanes.

Additionally, Trump was not in office during Gadhafi's visit.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in January 2022 was 3.8%, and in January 2021, it was 6.4%. This means the unemployment rate has indeed decreased by 2.6 percentage points, not 2. Therefore, the claim is false.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time data to verify this claim.

"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget is a simplification of a complex political and economic situation. Ted Strickland served as the Governor of Ohio from 2007 to 2011. During his tenure, Ohio faced significant economic challenges, including the Great Recession. The budget cuts he implemented were part of efforts to address the state's fiscal crisis. While these cuts may have led to job losses in certain sectors, it is not accurate to attribute all job losses in Ohio to these specific budget cuts. The broader economic context, including national and global economic factors, also played a significant role in job losses during this period.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not force businesses to drop coverage for their employees. Instead, it provides an option for businesses to choose between offering coverage to their employees or paying a penalty. Additionally, the ACA does not affect the 120 million Americans who are currently uninsured or those who are insured through Medicare or Medicaid. The claim is a misinterpretation of the ACA's provisions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, including Virginia, income tax rates are progressive, meaning that higher earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.

For example, in Virginia, the top income tax rate is 5.75% for income over $12,000, while the lowest rate is 0% for income up to $12,000. Therefore, a cashier earning $20,000 per year would pay a lower tax rate than a hedge fund manager earning $20 million per year.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that 56 percent of weekend voters in Cuyahoga County in 2008 were African American, while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population. This claim is false because it suggests a disproportionately high percentage of African American voters on weekends compared to their representation in the county's adult population. This is unlikely to be accurate as voter turnout is typically influenced by various factors such as accessibility, interest in the election, and other demographic factors, not just race.

"Explanation: Georgia has indeed been known for its robust scholarship programs, including the HOPE Scholarship, which provides financial assistance to Georgia residents attending eligible postsecondary institutions. However, the claim that Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""richest."" Other states may have more comprehensive or higher-value scholarship programs. Therefore, while Georgia's scholarship programs are notable, it is not accurate to say that it has one of the richest programs without additional context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy prisons is false. Tax breaks and deductions are typically associated with personal income tax, not the purchase of prisons.

While the ACA expanded access to health insurance, it did not guarantee that every uninsured American would become insured due to factors like income, eligibility for Medicaid, and personal choices. Some people may still remain uninsured due to these factors.

While it is true that the 2008 financial crisis had a disproportionate impact on African-American communities, with many losing their homes and savings, the claim that they lost half of their wealth is not accurate. According to a report by the Pew Research Center, the median wealth of African-American households fell by 34% between 2005 and 2010, but this does not equate to a loss of half of their wealth.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report. The CBO estimated that a cap-and-trade program could increase the cost of living for the average family by about $1,000 per year. This is not equivalent to a postage stamp a day, which costs about $0.50. The claim exaggerates the impact of the CBO's findings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about campaign contributions from electric utilities is generally true. Many electric utilities in the United States are regulated by state public utility commissions and are required to disclose their political contributions. These contributions are often made to support candidates who are seen as favorable to the industry's interests, such as those who support deregulation or other industry-friendly policies.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that Jon Corzine did not raise tolls by 50 percent. However, this claim is false because Jon Corzine, who served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2002 to 2006, did indeed propose a 50 percent increase in tolls during his tenure. This proposal was part of a broader plan to address the state's budget deficit.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that deep poverty has reached its highest level on record over the past three years is false. According to the World Bank, the global poverty rate has been declining over the past few decades. In 2015, the global poverty rate was 10.0%, and by 2018, it had fallen to 8.6%. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on poverty rates, the World Bank's latest data shows that the global poverty rate in 2020 was 9.1%, which is still lower than the rate in 2015. Therefore, the claim that deep poverty has reached its highest level on record is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military has not asked for is false. Romney has proposed increasing the defense budget, but the specific figure of $2 trillion is not accurate. He has suggested increasing the defense budget by around $100 billion, which is a significant increase but not the $2 trillion mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the claim that the military has not asked for this increase is misleading, as the military has requested increases in the defense budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Michael Williams, a U.S. House opponent, does not live in and has never voted in the congressional district he is seeking to represent. This claim is false because it is a common practice for candidates to run for office in districts where they do not currently reside. Many candidates move to the district they are running in or have lived there previously. The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that Williams has never voted in the district or does not live there.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal corporate tax rate is 21%, not 44.6%. Additionally, the Canadian federal corporate tax rate is 15%, but this is not the total business tax rate in Canada. Provincial and territorial taxes also apply, which can increase the overall tax burden. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. tax rate on successful small businesses is 44.6% and the business tax rate in Canada is 15% is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the annual spending on highways to the total spending on Amtrak over its entire 40-year history. The claim is false because it is comparing apples to oranges. The spending on highways is an annual figure, while the spending on Amtrak is a cumulative figure over 40 years. Therefore, the claim is misleading and cannot be accurately judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Deer baiting, also known as deer hunting with the use of bait, is indeed illegal in Rhode Island. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) has regulations in place that prohibit the use of bait for deer hunting. Therefore, the claim that deer baiting planned for Block Island by DEM is illegal in Rhode Island is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Liberty University students were mandated to attend Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential announcement or face a fine is false. There is no credible source or official statement from Liberty University or Sen. Ted Cruz that supports this claim. The university has not implemented such a policy, and Sen. Cruz's announcement was open to the public without any attendance requirements or fines.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Slim Jims just recently cost 99 cents but now cost $2.69 is false. Slim Jims have consistently been priced at $2.69 for a pack of 10. There is no evidence to suggest that the price has recently changed to 99 cents.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry agreed to lift Iran's economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct is false. In 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed, which included the lifting of sanctions in exchange for Iran's compliance with the agreement. However, the claim that this was done without any proof of change in conduct is misleading, as the agreement was based on Iran's commitment to limit its nuclear program and allow for inspections.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes is an oversimplification. While Estonia does offer an online tax filing system, the time it takes to complete the process can vary depending on the complexity of your tax situation. For instance, if you have a simple tax return with no deductions or credits, it might take less than five minutes. However, if you have multiple sources of income, deductions, or credits, the process could take significantly longer. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Oregon Department of Human Services in 2010. The study found that approximately 75% of child abuse and neglect reports in Oregon were made by individuals who were required to report by law, such as teachers, healthcare providers, and law enforcement officers. This information is accurate and has been verified by multiple sources.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Oregon Health Authority, which found that the implementation of Oregon's prescription-only law for pseudoephedrine (a common ingredient in methamphetamine) led to a significant reduction in meth lab incidents and arrests. The study reported a 96% decrease in meth lab incidents and a 32% decrease in meth-related arrests. These figures are supported by data and are not disputed by any credible sources.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to suggest that OShaughnessy voted for her own personal stimulus package or received a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a fictional character, Chet, who is not a real person and does not have a political stance or influence. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the truth of this claim as it is not based on any real event or person.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While it is accurate that health care premiums have increased since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the statement that they have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years is not supported by data. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, premiums have increased at a slower rate than in previous years, but this does not mean they are the slowest increase in the last 50 years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia Attorney General, has been criticized for his stance on immigration and social welfare policies. However, there is no widely reported or verified claim that he has specifically ""attacked churches for helping the poor."" While he has been critical of certain policies and organizations, there is no evidence to support the claim that he has targeted churches for their assistance to the poor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the outcomes of two different individuals' actions, Hillary Clinton and General David Petraeus, in relation to their respective scandals. The email scandal involving Hillary Clinton involved her use of a private email server for official communications, which was criticized for potential security risks and lack of transparency. General Petraeus, on the other hand, was involved in a scandal where he shared classified information with his mistress, which led to his resignation from the CIA and a prison sentence. The claim suggests that Clinton was let off the hook while Petraeus faced severe consequences. However, this is a simplification and an oversimplification of the facts. Clinton faced significant political and legal scrutiny, including investigations by the FBI and the House Select Committee on Benghazi, but was not charged with any crime. Petraeus, while facing severe consequences, was not ""destroyed"" in the sense that he was not imprisoned for a long period or faced life-altering penalties. The claim is misleading and inaccurate in its comparison.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a filibuster has never been successfully used against a Supreme Court justice is false. The most notable example is the 1968 filibuster against the nomination of Abe Fortas to the Supreme Court. The filibuster was led by Senator Strom Thurmond and lasted for 24 hours, but ultimately failed to prevent Fortas' confirmation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that scientists are questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is causing climate change is misleading. While there is ongoing scientific research and debate about various aspects of climate change, the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has repeatedly stated that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Therefore, the claim that this idea is ""more and more being put into question"" is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate is not supported by empirical evidence. While some studies have suggested that financial stress can contribute to divorce, there is no direct correlation between the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and an increase in divorce rates. Obamacare primarily focuses on expanding access to healthcare, not on marital status or divorce rates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or statement from Madison Mayor Paul Soglins indicating that his proposal to have city contractors disclose private political donations was intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees. The proposal was likely made to increase transparency and accountability in political donations, not to target specific organizations or donors.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Providence is one of the busiest fire departments for its relative size in the country is difficult to verify without specific data or a reliable source. The busiest fire departments are often determined by factors such as population density, number of fires, and response times. Without concrete evidence or a reputable source, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former President Barack Obama refused to put his hand on his heart or say the Pledge of Allegiance is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about the plan and the criteria for qualifying for income-tax relief. It also does not provide any evidence or sources to support the claim that 98 percent of all small businesses in Wisconsin will qualify. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a statement made by Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, where he criticized Hillary Clinton for her stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. The claim suggests that Clinton changed her position on the TPP after Trump's criticism, implying a shift in her stance. However, this claim is false because Hillary Clinton was consistently against the TPP throughout her 2016 campaign and did not change her position based on Trump's statements.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the status of illegal immigrants is a broad topic and can vary depending on the specific context and location. Without specific details, it's challenging to determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if the claim is about a general status or policy, it would need to be backed by reliable sources and current information to be considered true.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or needs more specific information to be evaluated as true.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Johnson Amendment, which was indeed pushed by Lyndon B. Johnson, does not threaten religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. The amendment, passed in 1954, prohibits 501(c)(3) organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates. However, it does not strip them of their tax-exempt status if they engage in political activities, as long as they do so in a non-partisan manner and do not endorse or oppose specific candidates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Jack Kingston had more earmarks at one time than every member of the Georgia delegation put together is a specific and quantifiable statement. To verify this claim, one would need to compare the number of earmarks received by Jack Kingston with the total number of earmarks received by all other members of the Georgia delegation during the same period. Without specific data or a reliable source to support this claim, it is not possible to definitively determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Gang of Eight"" bill, also known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did not give President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees without background checks. The bill included provisions for background checks for refugees, including Syrian refugees. The bill also established a process for reviewing and admitting refugees based on security and humanitarian considerations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the speaker stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 is false. Earmarks are specific funding requests for particular projects or programs, and they were widely used by members of Congress until they were largely phased out in 2011 due to public outcry and bipartisan efforts to reduce their use. Therefore, the claim that the speaker stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of events: lightning strikes and voter fraud. The likelihood of being struck by lightning is a function of weather patterns and geographical location, while voter fraud is a legal and political issue. According to the National Weather Service, Texas is one of the states with the highest number of lightning strikes due to its size and the frequency of thunderstorms. On the other hand, voter fraud is a rare event, and its incidence is typically very low. Therefore, the claim that you are more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find in-person voter fraud is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim about whether the federal government should set a minimum wage is a topic of ongoing debate and policy discussion. It is not a fact that can be definitively judged as true or false because it depends on one's perspective and the specific context of the discussion. The federal government has set a minimum wage in the past, and the debate revolves around whether it should continue to do so, increase it, or leave it to the states.

Answer: 0 (The claim is not a definitive fact and cannot be judged as true or false.)"
"Explanation: The claim that eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke since 2010 is false. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there have been 52 child vehicular heatstroke deaths in the United States from 1998 to 2020. However, the claim specifies eight children in Georgia, which is not accurate. The NHTSA does not provide specific state-by-state data for child vehicular heatstroke deaths.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The term ""carpet bombing"" refers to the extensive and indiscriminate bombing of a large area, often a city or a populated region, to achieve a strategic or tactical goal. It does not specifically refer to bombing the location of troops with embedded special forces to direct air power. The term is more commonly used to describe the bombing of civilian areas rather than military targets. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Too many tattoos on visible body parts keepsome applicants out of the military"" is generally true. The U.S. military, for example, has specific regulations regarding tattoos. The Army, for instance, allows tattoos on the arms, legs, and torso, but not on the head, neck, or hands. The Navy and Marine Corps have similar restrictions. These regulations are in place to maintain a professional appearance and to ensure that tattoos do not interfere with the wear of certain uniforms or equipment. Therefore, having too many tattoos on visible body parts can indeed disqualify some applicants from joining the military.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim ""You lie!"" is a direct response to President Obama's statement that health reform would not insure illegal immigrants. This claim is not a factual statement but rather an emotional or rhetorical response. It does not provide any evidence or information to support its truthfulness. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on factual information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""The fact is it's not amnesty"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. Amnesty typically refers to the forgiveness of a crime or debt, often in exchange for a promise of good behavior. Without additional context or details about what is being forgiven or the circumstances surrounding the claim, it is impossible to definitively judge whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon"" is false. In most countries, including the United States, it is illegal for private citizens to purchase automatic weapons. Automatic weapons are heavily regulated and typically require special permits or licenses, and they are not available for purchase by the general public. The claim that ""Most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon"" is also false, as the vast majority of people cannot legally purchase automatic weapons.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by former Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. While it is difficult to quantify the exact level of unpopularity of any governor, Christie's tenure was marked by controversies and low approval ratings. For instance, a 2014 poll by Quinnipiac University found that 42% of New Jersey residents approved of Christie's job performance, while 51% disapproved. This indicates that Christie was indeed unpopular during his tenure. However, the claim that he was ""maybe the most unpopular governor in the country"" is subjective and cannot be definitively proven. Therefore, the claim is partially true but lacks specific evidence to support the ""most unpopular"" part.

Answer: 0.5"
"Explanation: The claim that Democrats plan to raise tax rates to 70 or 80 percent is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible evidence or official proposal from the Democratic Party or any of its prominent figures suggesting such a drastic increase in tax rates. Tax policy proposals from Democrats typically focus on progressive taxation, which aims to increase the tax burden on higher-income individuals, but not to the extent of 70 or 80 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, also known as Act 10, did not seek 12 percent to 13 percent of public employees' incomes for health insurance premiums. The bill primarily focused on reducing collective bargaining rights and increasing employee contributions to health insurance and pension plans. The specific percentage increase in employee contributions was not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's energy agenda will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion is a misrepresentation of her actual policies and their potential impacts. Hillary Clinton's energy agenda, as outlined during her 2016 presidential campaign, focused on transitioning to renewable energy sources, investing in clean energy technologies, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While these policies could have significant costs, the claim of a $5 trillion cost is not supported by credible sources or analyses. The $5 trillion figure appears to be a fabrication or an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"

Without concrete information or references, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has added 200,000 new federal jobs over the last two years since President Obama took office is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of federal employees has actually decreased since 2009. In 2009, there were approximately 2.1 million federal employees, and by 2011, the number had decreased to about 2.0 million. Therefore, the claim that 200,000 new federal jobs were added is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about unemployment rates in Southwest Virginia.

Therefore, the claim is not verifiable without additional context or data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama said that small businesses succeed because of government is false. While President Obama did emphasize the importance of government support for small businesses, he did not attribute their success solely to government intervention.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that K-12 students in the United States are scoring at the bottom in science and mathematics in the industrialized world is not accurate. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is a global assessment of 15-year-olds' educational performance, the United States ranks 36th in mathematics and 24th in science among the 70 participating countries. While these rankings are not at the top, they are not at the bottom either. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that royalties for oil and other energy sources are the ""second-largest revenue source to the federal government after the IRS"" is not accurate. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is indeed the largest revenue source for the federal government, primarily through income taxes. Royalties from oil and other energy sources are significant, but they are not the second-largest revenue source. The second-largest revenue source is typically from payroll taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare taxes.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Brady Bill, also known as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, was a piece of legislation aimed at preventing gun violence. Sen.

"Explanation: The claim that there are corporations in this nation who do not pay taxes is generally true. Many corporations, especially large ones, often use various legal strategies to minimize their tax liabilities. These strategies can include tax avoidance through loopholes in the tax code, shifting profits to lower-tax jurisdictions, or taking advantage of tax incentives and credits. However, it's important to note that the extent to which corporations avoid taxes can vary widely, and some corporations do pay significant amounts of taxes.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that a congressional district is the fourth-poorest in the nation is not verifiable without specific data or context. The ranking of congressional districts by poverty rates can change and is typically based on the latest census data. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Patrick Murphy wrongly conveyed Rubio's stance on abortion for women infected by Zika is a matter of political interpretation and can vary based on the source and context. However, if the claim is based on a specific statement or policy position by Rubio, it would need to be evaluated against that specific statement or policy. Without specific details or a clear source, it's challenging to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the recent drop in the unemployment rate is questionable because it was calculated over two days of the Thanksgiving week. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) typically adjusts its unemployment rate calculations to account for holidays and other factors that might affect the data. The BLS uses a method called the ""seasonal adjustment"" to account for these variations, ensuring that the unemployment rate reflects a consistent period of time. Therefore, the claim that the drop in unemployment rate is questionable due to the calculation period is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama said we should talk to Iran in his first TV interview as president is false. While President Obama did advocate for diplomatic engagement with Iran, this specific quote is not from his first TV interview as president. The misquote is often attributed to a 2009 interview with ABC News, but the exact quote was not ""we should talk to Iran"" but rather ""we should engage with Iran.""

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""I have never voted for a tax increase"" is a statement of personal belief or action, and without specific evidence or context, it is impossible to verify its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that some coal mines in Tennessee are located above 2,000 feet, it is not accurate to say that ""all the coal in the state of Tennessee is above 2,000 feet.""

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's re-election would result in state and federal income tax rates rising to roughly 65 percent for some taxpayers is false. During President Obama's second term, the top federal income tax rate was 39.6 percent for individuals earning over $400,000. Additionally, state income tax rates varied widely and did not reach 65 percent for any taxpayer. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of tax policy changes that occurred during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his position on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Initially, Romney supported the TARP program during his 2012 presidential campaign. However, after his defeat, he criticized the program and its effectiveness. In 2014, he stated that he would have opposed the TARP program if he had been president. Therefore, the claim that Romney has changed his position on supporting the TARP program is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the St. Norbert College/Wisconsin Public Radio poll has been wrong in almost every election is not accurate. While polls can sometimes be inaccurate, it is not accurate to say that they have been wrong in almost every election. Polls are a valuable tool for predicting election outcomes, and their accuracy can vary depending on the specific election and the methodology used. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Government Accountability Board (GAB) never considered Mickey Mouse or Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions. The GAB's role is to ensure that recall petitions meet certain legal requirements, including that signatures are from registered voters and are not forged or fraudulent. The claim is a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the GAB's role and responsibilities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Ohio has a history of passing legislation to stop referendums. For example, in 2011, the Ohio legislature passed a law that required signatures for ballot initiatives to be collected in a specific order, which was later ruled unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court. Therefore, the claim that an effort to repeal voting-reform legislation would be the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have never been involved in legislation, hearings, or engagement on the issue of climate change is false.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Congress as a whole is less popular than it has been since polling was invented"" is difficult to verify without specific data and context. Popularity of Congress can vary greatly depending on the time period, specific events, and the political climate. However, general trends in public opinion polls can provide some insight. According to various polls and surveys, Congress has consistently been one of the least popular institutions in the United States for many years. While it's challenging to pinpoint an exact point in history where Congress was more popular, it's generally accepted that public opinion of Congress has been low for a significant period.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that abortion has reduced the black population by more than 25 percent since 1973 is false. Abortion rates are influenced by various factors, including socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and cultural attitudes.

Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to support the 25 percent reduction figure.

The closure of the MVC was part of a broader effort to reduce state spending and improve efficiency.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The $290 million structural surplus in the 2011-13 Wisconsin budget was not solely based on the assumption that Congress would reinstate the estate tax. The surplus was primarily due to a combination of factors, including increased revenue from sales tax, income tax, and other sources. The estate tax assumption was one of several factors considered in the budget projections, but it was not the sole basis for the surplus.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The poverty rate among the elderly in the United States has indeed decreased significantly over time. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1935, the poverty rate for the elderly was around 50%. However, by 2020, the poverty rate for the elderly was around 9.7%, not 9.4%. The claim incorrectly states the current poverty rate as 9.4%.

Both policies had positive impacts on the economy and employment rates.

These actions were part of her efforts to stabilize the financial system and prevent a recurrence of the crisis.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Constitution, members of Congress are paid by the federal government. During a government shutdown, which occurs when Congress and the President cannot agree on a budget, federal employees, including members of Congress, are typically not paid. However, there is a provision in the Constitution that ensures members of Congress are paid for their services, even during a shutdown. This is because the Constitution states that members of Congress are to be paid for their services, and this payment is considered a ""necessary expense"" that cannot be withheld.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Obama has flip-flopped on public campaign financing is false. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama initially accepted public campaign financing, but later decided to forgo it in order to raise funds through private donations.

However, the claim that this act gave Barack Obama about 15 million additional Hispanic votes in 2012 is unfounded. The IRCA did not directly influence the 2012 presidential election, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it resulted in a significant increase in Hispanic votes for Obama.

There is no evidence to support the claim that Trump made such a statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration ""gutted"" the Project ChildSafe budget to provide trigger locks and safety kits is misleading. The Project ChildSafe program was established in 1999, during the Clinton administration, and was not directly related to the Obama administration.

The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the facts.

"Explanation: Ebola is primarily transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of an infected person, or indirect contact with surfaces or objects contaminated with these fluids. While it is possible for Ebola to be transmitted through the air in a laboratory setting, such as through an aerosolized virus, this is not a typical or common mode of transmission in the real world. The claim that Ebola can be transmitted through a sneeze or cough is not supported by scientific evidence and is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the virus's transmission methods.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the bishops of the United States came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care in 1919 is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Supreme Court of the United States has not made 15 rulings stating that marriage is a fundamental right. The most relevant case is Loving v. Virginia (1967), where the Court ruled that laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional. However, the Court has not explicitly stated that marriage must be between a man and a woman. The claim also misrepresents the history and interpretation of the Court's rulings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""the money is in the budget to give a tax break to everyone, including people making more than $1 million"" is false. The U.S. federal budget does not typically include provisions for universal tax breaks, especially for high-income individuals.

"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require members of Congress to purchase their health insurance from the new exchanges. Instead, members of Congress and their staff are eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a separate health insurance program for federal employees. The ACA does not apply to members of Congress in the same way it does to the general public.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The highest value of a General Motors share ever was not $43, $44, or $46. The highest value of a General Motors share was $143.50, which occurred on October 1, 2007. Therefore, the claim that GM would have to sell its shares at $143 a share to pay back everything it owes is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the House of Delegates budget bill cuts $50 million from education is false.

"Explanation: In Texas, public schools are required to teach science in a way that is consistent with the scientific method and the standards set by the Texas State Board of Education. While the Texas Education Code does not explicitly prohibit the teaching of creationism, it does not require it either. The focus is on teaching evolution as a scientific theory. Therefore, the claim that Texas teaches both creationism and evolution in public schools is misleading because while evolution is taught, creationism is not.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a telecom bill could prevent the State Corporation Commission (SCC) from obtaining rate-of-return information from electric utilities. This claim is false because the SCC's authority to regulate and oversee electric utilities is not dependent on a telecom bill. The SCC's role in regulating utilities is established by law and is not affected by telecommunications legislation. Therefore, a telecom bill would not impact the SCC's ability to gather rate-of-return information.

Answer: 0"

Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Without specific details about the individual making the claim and the context in which these actions were taken, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a majority of Americans since Harry Truman days support single-payer health insurance, or full Medicare for all, is not accurate. While there has been consistent support for some form of universal healthcare among Americans, the specific support for single-payer or full Medicare for all has varied over time. Polls and surveys have shown that support for these ideas has fluctuated, and there is no consistent majority support dating back to the Harry Truman era. Additionally, the specific terminology and details of these proposals can influence public opinion, making it difficult to pinpoint a consistent majority support.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Benghazi probe is the longest-running congressional investigation ever is false. While the Benghazi investigation was extensive and lasted for several years, it is not the longest-running congressional investigation in history.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that repealing the prevailing wage law would make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers. However, prevailing wage laws are typically designed to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage, and repealing such laws would not inherently create a loophole for hiring illegal workers. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the effects of repealing prevailing wage laws. Additionally, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that there is an ""illegal worker loophole"" in the state budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The United States Constitution does not explicitly state that people can be put to death. However, it does allow for the death penalty through the Fifth Amendment, which states that ""No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.""

The stimulus package was designed to create jobs and boost the economy, not to eliminate them.

"Explanation: While it is true that some smaller cities and counties in Georgia may not have official websites or email addresses for their elected officials, it is not accurate to say that this is a widespread or universal issue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math is false. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a global assessment that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science. The United States typically ranks in the middle of the pack among developed countries, not developing countries. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the PISA results.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work"" is not supported by reliable sources or empirical evidence. Smart guns, which are firearms with built-in safety features, are designed to prevent unauthorized use.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the Rhode Island Parole Board never received an objection from the attorney general to the parole of convicted murderer Alfred Brissette.

"Explanation: The claim is false. In 2008, African-Americans did not vote their percentage of the population in Mississippi. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, African-Americans made up about 37% of Mississippi's population in 2008, but they only accounted for about 25% of the votes in that state. Therefore, the claim that Mississippi would suddenly become a Democratic state if African-Americans voted their percentage of the population is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that Harry Reid's plan is ""basically giving the president a blank check"" is a political statement that is subjective and depends on one's interpretation of Reid's plan. Reid's plan, often referred to as the ""Reid Plan,"" was a proposal to raise the debt ceiling without any specific spending cuts or revenue increases. This plan was criticized by some as giving the president a ""blank check"" because it would allow the president to increase the debt without any immediate fiscal responsibility. However, this interpretation is a matter of political opinion and not a verifiable fact.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a specific event involving the payment of a ransom to Iran for hostages, which is a sensitive and high-profile topic.

Without a clear definition of what ""in trouble"" means and specific data sources, it is impossible to accurately assess the truth of this claim.

"Explanation: Jeff Merkley was indeed a key figure in the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2010, but he was not the deciding vote. The deciding vote was cast by Senator Joe Lieberman, who switched his vote from opposing to supporting the bill after negotiations. Merkley's role was significant, but he did not cast the deciding vote. Additionally, the claim that Obamacare has been an unmitigated disaster in Oregon is a matter of opinion and depends on the specific metrics and perspectives used to evaluate its impact.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that a 5% increase in domestic production would have a minimal impact on the world supply and prices. However, this claim oversimplifies the complex dynamics of global energy markets. A 5% increase in domestic production could have a more significant impact on the world supply and prices depending on various factors such as global demand, supply from other countries, and market reactions. Additionally, the claim does not account for potential changes in domestic consumption patterns or the potential for increased domestic production to influence international prices.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that every time the price of gasoline rises by 1 cent, it takes a billion dollars out of the economy and sends it to Saudi Arabia is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. The impact of a 1-cent increase in gasoline prices on the economy and on Saudi Arabia's revenue is not as direct or significant as the claim suggests. The claim also implies a direct correlation between the price of gasoline and Saudi Arabia's revenue, which is not accurate. The actual economic impact of gasoline price changes is more complex and involves various factors, including consumer spending, business operations, and global energy markets.

"Explanation: The claim that ""we cut taxes for 95 percent of working families"" is a generalization that is not supported by specific data or evidence.

"Explanation: The claim that the United States has a record number of abortions year after year is not accurate. According to the Guttmacher Institute, the number of abortions in the United States has been declining since the 1980s. In 2019, the number of abortions was at its lowest since 1973, the year Roe v. Wade was decided. The claim may be based on a misunderstanding of the data or a misinterpretation of recent trends.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: While drone technology has advanced significantly, the claim that drones as small as birds can record individuals in their homes and immediately upload the footage to the internet is not accurate. Drones of that size would have limited battery life and storage capacity, making real-time uploading impractical. Additionally, the legal and ethical implications of such surveillance would be significant, and it's unlikely that such technology would be widely available or used without proper authorization.

"Explanation: The first word spoken from the moon was not ""Houston"". The first words spoken from the moon were ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,"" spoken by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969. The phrase ""Houston, we have a problem"" was famously spoken by Jack Swigert during the Apollo 13 mission, but it was not the first words spoken from the moon.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading cause of death among African-American men aged 15-34 is homicide, not gun-related deaths specifically. While gun violence is a significant issue, it is not the leading cause of death when considering all causes of homicide. The claim exaggerates the impact of gun violence and misrepresents the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Laureate Education, but there is no connection between Hillary Clinton's role and any alleged money laundering. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

"Explanation: The claim that the black unemployment rate has increased since the recovery has begun is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for black Americans has been decreasing since the recovery began.

"Explanation: The claim states that only 18 percent of Portland elementary schools have art instruction compared to 83 percent nationally. This claim is comparing a specific local statistic (Portland) to a national average. Without specific data sources or references to support the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. However, the claim itself is not inherently false; it is a statement that could be true or false depending on the data sources used.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim about Bill White bringing in 250,000 refugees to Dallas and San Antonio after Hurricane Katrina and housing them in empty apartment buildings for over two years is not accurate.

Additionally, the claim that most of these refugees are still on welfare is not supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that salaries and benefits for Wisconsin state employees comprised 8.5 percent of the 2009-2011 state budget.

"Explanation: The claim that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003 is false. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), American oil production reached its highest level in 2019, with a daily production of about 12.6 million barrels. In 2020, production decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has since rebounded. However, it has not yet reached the levels seen in 2019.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the budget request for veterans in 2016 (during President Obama's term) with the appropriated amount in 1980. However, the claim does not specify whether the 1980 figure is in constant dollars or not. If the 1980 figure is not adjusted for inflation, then the claim is false because the value of money has decreased significantly over time. If the 1980 figure is in constant dollars, then the claim would need to be verified with actual data to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it does not specify whether the 1980 figure is in constant dollars or not.)"
"Explanation: The claim that seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality is not supported by any specific data or survey results.

Therefore, the claim is not verifiable based on available data.

Answer: 0"

The claim appears to be a generalization or an anecdotal observation rather than a factual statement.

Answer: 0"

However, the claim that the U.S. is ranked 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim states that ""The state ethics commission took absolutely the same percent of cuts as most other state agencies. They were somewhere in the 7 percent range same as the governors office."" To verify this claim, we would need to check the official records or reports from the state ethics commission and other relevant state agencies to confirm the percentage of cuts they received. Without specific data or official sources, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal, known as the ""Better Way"" plan, does include cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and defense spending over the long term. While it is true that the proposal does not cut these programs in the next two to three years, it does propose significant changes to these programs over a longer period. Additionally, the proposal does not cut the debt in three years; instead, it aims to reduce the debt over a longer period. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Hillary Clinton's immigration platform during her 2016 presidential campaign did not propose ""totally open borders."" Instead, her platform focused on comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, increased border security, and a focus on legal immigration. The term ""open borders"" is often used to describe a policy that allows anyone to enter a country without restriction, which is not what Clinton's platform advocated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the situation in Iraq, but it lacks specific data or sources to support it. Without concrete evidence or reliable sources, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame for ""last year,"" which could be interpreted differently depending on the context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Barack Obama had one of the worst attendance records in the Senate is false. According to the Washington Post, Sen. Obama had an attendance record of 96.4% during his time in the Senate, which was above average. The claim likely confuses Sen. Obama's attendance with that of Sen. Marco Rubio, who had a lower attendance record.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that state legislators quietly shifted $2 billion from education to road building in 2013 is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim. The shift of funds from education to road building would typically be a significant and public event, as it would involve budgetary changes that would be reported in official documents and news outlets. The lack of any supporting evidence or official records makes this claim unfounded.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, San Antonio has had an African American woman mayor, but it is not accurate to say that San Antonio is now the largest city in the United States ever to have an African American woman mayor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Travis County is located in Texas, USA. The surrounding counties are not all red (Republican-leaning). For example, Travis County itself is a Democratic-leaning county, and there are other counties in the area that are also Democratic-leaning. Therefore, the claim that Travis County is surrounded by red counties is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the national healthcare law (Affordable Care Act) puts federal bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor is a common misconception. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) primarily aims to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs, not to create a new layer of bureaucracy between patients and their doctors. The law does introduce some new regulations and oversight, but these are primarily aimed at ensuring that insurance companies and healthcare providers operate in the best interests of patients. The law does not replace the patient-doctor relationship with federal bureaucrats.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that she is co-owner of Celilo Group Media cannot be verified without additional information.

"Explanation: The claim that 3 million votes in a presidential election were cast by illegal aliens is false. U.S. law prohibits non-citizens from voting in federal elections. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation. There is no credible evidence to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""the stories from women saying he groped or forced himself on them largely have been debunked"" is false. There have been numerous credible allegations of sexual misconduct against various public figures, including Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, and others. While some allegations may have been debunked or proven false, many others have been substantiated through investigations, legal proceedings, and testimonies. The claim oversimplifies and misrepresents the complexity of these cases.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that tuition in Virginia colleges has doubled in the last 10 years is not accurate. According to the College Board's annual report on tuition and fees, the average tuition and fees for in-state students at public colleges in Virginia increased by about 30% from the 2011-2012 academic year to the 2021-2022 academic year. This is a significant increase, but it is not a 100% increase.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The decision to cancel the trademark of the Washington Redskins was made by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), not Barack Obama. The USPTO canceled the trademark in 2020 due to the team's name being deemed offensive to Native Americans. Barack Obama was not involved in this decision.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Iran nuclear deal involved the U.S. giving Iran $150 billion and receiving nothing in return is a simplification and an exaggeration. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a multilateral agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States), and the European Union. The agreement involved Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The $150 billion figure refers to the estimated value of Iran's frozen assets abroad, which were released to Iran as part of the agreement. However, the claim that the U.S. received nothing in return is false, as the agreement was designed to address Iran's nuclear program and the lifting of sanctions was a key part of that agreement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""Says Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar"" is highly unlikely to be true. Consuming 16 packs of sugar in a short period is an extremely large amount and would be dangerous for a child's health. It is not a typical or realistic scenario.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who did not serve is generally true. According to various studies and reports, such as those from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans, particularly younger ones, often face higher unemployment rates compared to their civilian counterparts. This is often attributed to factors like the transition from military to civilian life, lack of civilian work experience, and the challenges of reintegrating into the workforce.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst promises to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA is false. Joni Ernst has not made such promises.

Similarly, she has expressed concerns about the EPA's regulations but has not promised to abolish the agency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a politician has never asked for nor received a single earmark or pork barrel project for their state is difficult to verify without specific evidence. Earmarks and pork barrel projects are often allocated through complex political processes, and it's possible for a politician to deny involvement in such projects. However, without concrete evidence or a public record of such denials, it's challenging to definitively judge the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to bring in thousands of refugees to America from all around the world without any kind of security screening is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country is likely false. While Georgia does experience a significant number of lightning strikes due to its geographical location and climate, it is not necessarily the state with the highest number of insurance claims for lightning strikes. The number of claims can vary based on factors such as population density, insurance coverage, and the specific insurance companies operating in the state. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax, is not accurate. While it is true that Ohio has seen a decline in the number of family farms, the rate of loss is not as high as claimed. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of farms in Ohio has been declining, but the rate of loss is not as severe as the claim suggests. Additionally, inheritance tax is not a significant factor in the loss of family farms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. President does not have the authority to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval. The Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by Congress in 2001 and 2002 provides the legal basis for military action in Iraq and Syria, but it does not give the President the authority to initiate strikes without congressional approval.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence in 2011 is false. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the number of homicides in New Jersey in 2011 was 147, not 269. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a famous quote by Benjamin Franklin, which is often attributed to him. The original quote is: ""Nothing is certain but death and taxes."" The claim adds a humorous twist by suggesting that even Franklin did not foresee the tax man visiting on the day of one's death. This is a creative interpretation of the quote and does not change the original meaning or the fact that Franklin did indeed say something similar. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government reneging on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin caused about $240 million in extra costs in the 2013-15 state budget is false. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported that the state received $1.2 billion in federal Medicaid funds in 2013 and $1.3 billion in 2014, with no significant reduction in federal funding during the 2013-15 period. The $240 million figure appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a federal program that provides health coverage to children from low-income families. The income limit for CHIP varies by state, but it is typically for families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level. In 2021, this means a family of four could earn up to $51,000 per year and still qualify for CHIP. Therefore, a family making $60,000 a year would not qualify for CHIP.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that the current minimum wage in New Jersey is insufficient to lift a single-parent family out of poverty. However, the poverty threshold for a family of three (which is the typical composition of a single-parent family with one child) in New Jersey is $26,500 per year. The current minimum wage in New Jersey is $15 per hour, which translates to approximately $31,200 per year for a full-time worker. Therefore, a single-parent family earning the minimum wage at a full-time job would not live in poverty.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for the country is false. The speech in question was delivered by President Barack Obama in 2009, and it was a speech aimed at improving relations with the Muslim world. While it did address some historical grievances, it was not an apology for the country as a whole. The speech was more about setting a new tone and direction for U.S. foreign policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""two-thirds of our economy is a consumer economy"" is not accurate. The consumer economy refers to the portion of the economy that is driven by consumer spending. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending accounts for about 68% of the U.S. economy, not two-thirds. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette are both basketball teams, but they are not directly comparable in terms of age. The Milwaukee Bucks are a professional basketball team that was founded in 1968, while Marquette is a college basketball team that was founded in 1977. The claim that the Milwaukee Bucks are younger than the Marquette team is false because the Marquette team is a college team and the Milwaukee Bucks are a professional team. The age of the teams is not directly comparable as they are not the same type of team.

"Explanation: Connie Mack, a former Major League Baseball player and manager, has been involved in a public child support dispute.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that NATO hasn't provided enough troops to Afghanistan because they are still angry about the U.S. going into Iraq is a misinterpretation of the situation. The decision to deploy troops to Afghanistan and the number of troops allocated is primarily based on strategic military assessments and political considerations, not as a response to residual anger from the Iraq War. NATO's involvement in Afghanistan is a separate and distinct mission from its involvement in Iraq.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the unemployment insurance trust fund is broke and that there is over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government is false. The unemployment insurance trust fund is a federal fund that provides benefits to workers who are unemployed. The fund is not broke, and it does not have a debt to the federal government. The fund is currently solvent and has a balance of over $200 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Paul Ryan, a former Speaker of the House, did not vote for any bill that would force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees. The bill in question, the Equality Act, was introduced by Congressman David Cicilline and not by Teddy Kennedy. Additionally, Paul Ryan did not vote for the Equality Act, as he was not a member of Congress at the time it was introduced.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""The vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country"" is a statement made by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there is not much evidence to suggest that people have contributed to global warming or can do very much to change anything is false. There is overwhelming scientific consensus that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly contributed to global warming.

However, the CFPB's structure and independence have been a subject of debate and political contention.

"Explanation: The claim states that 600,000 jobs have been lost over the last 10 years, and only Michigan and California have done worse. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the following:
1. The total number of jobs lost in the U.S. over the last 10 years.
2. The job loss in Michigan and California specifically.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. has experienced a net increase in employment over the last 10 years. As of 2021, the U.S. has added approximately 11.4 million jobs since 2011. This contradicts the claim that 600,000 jobs have been lost.

Budget gaps are typically calculated based on various economic indicators, revenue projections, and spending plans.

"Explanation: The claim states that 37% of Central Falls retired police officers and firefighters are out on disability pensions, while in most municipalities, about 5% of retirees collect disability pensions. This claim is comparing a specific percentage for Central Falls to a general percentage for most municipalities. Without specific data or sources to support the 37% figure for Central Falls, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim. However, the general statement about the 5% figure for most municipalities is a common statistic and is often used in discussions about disability pensions among retirees.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false because the 37% figure for Central Falls is not supported by specific data or sources.)"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific percentage of early voters in the 2008 election.

"Explanation: The claim that ""ObamaCare charges the IRS with implementing"" is false. The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) does not directly charge the IRS with implementing the law. Instead, the IRS is responsible for administering and enforcing certain provisions of the law, such as the individual mandate and the employer mandate, but it is not tasked with implementing the entire law. The implementation of the law is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

"Explanation: The claim that there are over 300 million firearms in the United States is an exaggeration. According to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center, about 30% of American adults own a firearm. Assuming an adult population of around 250 million, this would mean approximately 75 million adults own firearms. However, this number does not account for the fact that some people own multiple firearms, and it does not include children or other individuals who may own firearms. Therefore, the claim that there are over 300 million firearms in the country is an overestimation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government has allocated a total of $1.9 trillion for the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which includes the stimulus plan. As of the latest reports, the majority of the funds have been spent or allocated. The remaining funds are not necessarily unspent but are being held for future use or are in the process of being allocated. The claim that there is still about $400 billion or $500 billion unspent is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that a 9-9-9 tax reform plan is not regressive is based on the specifics of the plan. A regressive tax system is one where the tax burden is higher for lower-income individuals relative to their income. The 9-9-9 tax reform plan, proposed by some politicians, suggests a flat tax rate of 9% for income, 9% for sales, and 9% for capital gains. While this plan simplifies the tax code, it is generally considered regressive because it does not account for the ability to pay and can disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who spend a larger portion of their income on consumption.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a maximum age limit of 112 years for active Social Security numbers. However, the SSA does not issue Social Security numbers to individuals who are 112 years old or older. The SSA only issues Social Security numbers to individuals who are alive and have not yet reached the maximum age limit. Therefore, it is not possible for there to be 6.5 million people with active Social Security numbers who are 112 years old or older.

For example, in a 2015 speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, he said, ""We are the first nation to make the words 'liberty' and 'justice' more than just words."" He also used the phrase in a 2016 speech at the Pentagon. The claim that nobody in the administration would say these words is also false, as various officials, including the President himself, used the phrase.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The amendment in question, known as the ""Use of Force"" amendment, does indeed change existing rules of engagement for American service members. It specifies that military members may use deadly force in certain situations, such as when they reasonably believe that doing so is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or others. This is a significant change from the previous rules, which were more restrictive. Therefore, the claim that the amendment does nothing to change existing rules of engagement is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim that we can fix our roads without raising taxes is generally false. Road maintenance and repair require significant funding, which often comes from taxes. While there may be some potential for cost savings through efficiency improvements, innovative funding mechanisms, or public-private partnerships, the primary source of funding for road infrastructure is typically tax revenue. Therefore, the claim that we can fix our roads without raising taxes is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that Obama couldn't have afforded his home without Rezko's help is false. Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama purchased their home in Chicago in 2005, before he became a U.S. Senator. The home was purchased for $1.65 million, and they paid for it with their own funds. The claim that Rezko, a businessman and political donor, helped Obama afford the home is a misinterpretation of the facts. Rezko was involved in a political scandal in Illinois, but there is no evidence to suggest that he provided financial assistance to the Obamas for their home purchase.

"Explanation: The claim that the Clintons charge the Secret Service $10,000 monthly rent for the use of a Secret Service residence is false. The Secret Service does not charge the Clintons for the use of their residence. The Secret Service provides security for the Clintons, and the cost of their residence is covered by the federal government. The claim about the rent being equal to their mortgage payment is also false, as the Clintons do not pay a mortgage for the Secret Service residence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), also known as the ""death panel"" by critics, was created under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to recommend changes to Medicare payments to reduce the program's costs. However, the IPAB does not have the authority to interfere with the treatment decisions between patients and their doctors. The IPAB's role is limited to making recommendations to Congress about Medicare payments, not to dictate medical treatment. The term ""death panel"" was a misnomer used by critics to suggest that the IPAB would make decisions about end-of-life care, which is not accurate.

For example, the corporate tax rate in France is 25%, in Germany it is 25%, and in Japan it is 30.62%. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world at 35% is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim states that the United States doubled its commitment to fighting global AIDS in the first 17 months of the current president's term.

However, the claim does not specify the new commitment amount or provide any evidence to support the doubling of the commitment. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to the ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows individuals to use deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm. The claim suggests that this law has led to ""horrific events"" and that lives have been put into these situations. While it is true that the law has been criticized for contributing to an increase in gun violence and controversial shootings, the claim itself is vague and does not provide specific examples or evidence to support the assertion that the law has directly caused ""horrific events"" or put lives into these situations. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and lacks specific evidence to support its truthfulness.

"Explanation: The claim about the unemployment rate among blacks in Texas being 9.5% and wages falling for black workers since 2000 is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for blacks in Texas in 2021 was around 8.5%, which is indeed higher than the rate for whites (around 4.5%). However, the claim that the unemployment rate is ""far more than double white unemployment"" is misleading because it suggests a much higher disparity than the actual figures. Additionally, the claim about wages falling for black workers since 2000 is not supported by data. In fact, wages for black workers have generally increased over time, although the rate of increase has been slower compared to other groups.

This is part of the state's constitutional amendment process, which aims to give citizens more control over tax increases.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Fourteen million Americans mortgages are greater than the value of their homes"" is false. This statement is misleading because it implies that a significant number of Americans are underwater on their mortgages, which is not accurate. According to various sources, the number of Americans with mortgages greater than the value of their homes is much lower. For instance, as of 2021, the number of underwater mortgages in the U.S. was around 1.5 million, which is significantly less than the 14 million stated in the claim.

"Explanation: The claim that 20 million illegals voting would lead to the repeal of the Second Amendment is a false and misleading statement. The Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms, is a part of the U.S. Constitution and cannot be repealed by a simple majority vote. Additionally, the claim that 20 million illegals would vote is not supported by any credible evidence or data. The actual number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is estimated to be around 10.5 million, and even if they were all to vote, it would not be enough to repeal the Second Amendment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood has illegally sold baby parts is a misrepresentation of a 2015 controversy. The claim originated from a series of videos released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress, which alleged that Planned Parenthood was selling fetal tissue for profit. However, multiple investigations, including those by the FBI and the Department of Justice, found no evidence of illegal activity. The videos were later found to have been heavily edited and misleading. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: While toothaches can be extremely painful and uncomfortable, they are not typically life-threatening. Toothaches are usually caused by dental issues such as cavities, infections, or impacted wisdom teeth. While severe infections can lead to complications like sepsis, which can be life-threatening, this is not a common outcome of a typical toothache. Therefore, the claim that ""anyone can die of a toothache"" is an exaggeration and is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Jim Frishe wanted to tax us for doing our taxes through an accountant is false. Jim Frishe is a fictional character from the TV show ""The Office."" The show is a mockumentary-style sitcom and does not contain real-life political or tax-related discussions. Therefore, any claims about Jim Frishe's views on taxes are not based on factual information.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Jason Carter is a former governor of Georgia, and Nathan Deal was the governor of Georgia from 2011 to 2019. Jason Carter served as governor from 2019 to 2023.

Additionally, the claim that Jason Carter accuses the governor of underfunding education is not supported by any known statements or actions from Jason Carter.

The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has been involved in leasing areas for oil and gas exploration and development in the Gulf of Mexico, which includes waters off the coast of Florida. However, it's important to note that the specific areas and the extent of drilling activities can vary and are subject to environmental and regulatory considerations.

"Explanation: The claim that sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their healthcare bills is not supported by reliable data.

Ann Kuster, a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, has been a strong advocate for healthcare reform, but her stance does not involve a government takeover of healthcare that would result in Medicare losing $700 billion. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of her actual positions and the impact of healthcare reform on Medicare.

This is primarily due to the consolidation of insurance markets, as some insurers have exited the market or reduced their offerings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted women the right to vote, was ratified in 1920, not 1915. Additionally, the amendment was passed by the U.S. Congress and ratified by the states, not by a referendum in New Jersey.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. In the United States, federal law requires that military personnel be paid on time, regardless of government shutdowns. However, during a shutdown, the military is funded by the previous year's appropriations, and personnel are paid retroactively once the shutdown ends and appropriations are available. This means that while military personnel continue to serve and accrue pay, they will not actually receive their pay until the shutdown is over and the government has appropriated funds.

The claim that no polls included third-party candidates is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim that 98 percent of American families make under $250,000 a year is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, the median household income in the United States was $68,703. While it's true that a large percentage of families earn less than $250,000, the claim that 98 percent do so is an exaggeration. The actual percentage of families earning less than $250,000 is closer to 90 percent.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The weight of a single $1 bill is approximately 1 gram. The national debt of $14.1 trillion would require 14,100,000,000,000 bills. The weight of these bills would be 14,100,000,000,000 grams, or 14,100,000,000 kilograms. An aircraft carrier typically weighs around 100,000 tons (90,718,474 kilograms). Therefore, the weight of the bills would be approximately 155 aircraft carriers, not 136.

According to a 2018 report by the Wisconsin Policy Forum, Wisconsin's middle class has been shrinking, but it is not the fastest rate among all states. The report also noted that Wisconsin's middle class has been shrinking at a similar rate to other states in the Midwest. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of people who hunt and fish in Texas with the total attendance of the Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets games. According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold in Texas annually is around 1.5 million. On the other hand, the combined attendance of the four sports teams (Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets) is significantly lower. For example, in the 2021-2022 season, the combined attendance of these teams was approximately 3.5 million. Therefore, the claim that more people hunt and fish in Texas in a given year than attend the games of the four teams combined is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The religious liberty bill proposed in the Georgia House of Representatives, known as HB 105, does not explicitly exclude corporations from claiming a religious exemption. However, the bill does not provide a blanket exemption for corporations either. It allows individuals and businesses to claim a religious exemption based on their sincerely held beliefs, but it does not specify that corporations can automatically claim this exemption. Therefore, while corporations could potentially claim a religious exemption, it is not explicitly stated in the bill that they can do so.

"Explanation: The claim is not supported by reliable statistical evidence. While it is true that some students may experience a decrease in their SAT scores when retaking the test, the claim that one third of test-takers will get a lower score is an overgeneralization and not based on established data. The College Board, which administers the SAT, does not provide specific statistics on the percentage of students who score lower on a retake. Therefore, the claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Obama has declared and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions is false. While Sen. Barack Obama did express a willingness to engage in diplomatic talks with Iran during his presidency, he did not do so without preconditions. In fact, he maintained that such talks would require Iran to meet certain conditions, such as addressing its nuclear program and regional behavior. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim ""I'm proud to have had a 100 percent pro-life voting record"" is a statement that can be true or false depending on the context and the specific political positions of the individual making the claim. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting record of the individual in question. Without specific information about the individual's voting history, it is impossible to definitively determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in their monthly report on U.S. crude oil production and imports. The EIA reported that in March 2021, the U.S. produced more oil than it imported for the first time since 2002. This is a significant milestone, as it indicates a shift in the U.S.'s dependence on oil imports and a rise in domestic production.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that every eligible Mexican citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram is false.

"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that reducing obesity rates to the levels of the 1980s would significantly decrease healthcare costs, specifically for Medicare. However, this claim oversimplifies the issue. Obesity rates have been increasing due to a combination of factors, including changes in diet, physical activity, and environmental factors. Simply reducing obesity rates to 1980s levels would not necessarily lead to a trillion-dollar savings in Medicare costs. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential costs of implementing and maintaining such a reduction in obesity rates, nor does it consider the potential economic benefits of a healthier population.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim states that a 12-year council member has never chaired, vice-chaired, or led a single council committee meeting. This claim is false because it is not possible for a council member to have been in office for 12 years without having chaired, vice-chaired, or led at least one committee meeting. Council members typically have roles and responsibilities that include participating in and leading committee meetings.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that Mexico can afford to build a wall because of its trade deficit with the United States is misleading. While it is true that Mexico has a trade deficit with the United States, this does not directly translate to Mexico having the financial resources to build a wall. The trade deficit refers to the difference between the value of imports and exports, which is influenced by various factors including trade policies, economic conditions, and consumer preferences. The cost of building a wall would be a significant investment that would need to be funded through government spending, which is not directly related to the trade deficit.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Chicago White Sox can still get into the playoffs mathematically depends on several factors, including their remaining schedule, the performance of other teams, and the current standings. As of my last update, I don't have real-time data, but typically, teams can still mathematically make the playoffs if they have a reasonable number of games left and are within a certain number of games behind the teams in the playoff spots. However, without specific data on the current standings and remaining games, it's challenging to definitively say whether they can still make the playoffs.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that a candidate has released their past tax returns is a common political statement. However, without specific details or evidence, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of this claim. Typically, candidates release their tax returns to build trust with voters and demonstrate transparency. If the candidate has indeed released their tax returns, this claim would be true. If not, it would be false.

Answer: 1 (assuming the candidate has released their tax returns)"
"Explanation: The claim that the media widely overlooked comments made by former President Bill Clinton about Hillary Clinton's concussion is false. The incident in question occurred in 2016 when Hillary Clinton collapsed at a 9/11 memorial service. The media extensively covered the incident, and Bill Clinton himself made comments about it. He stated that Hillary Clinton had a concussion and that it took her six months to recover. This information was widely reported in the media at the time. Therefore, the claim that the media overlooked this information is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that she voted against the Medicare Part D prescription drug program because it was unfunded is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the average cost per vote for a candidate to the cost per vote for another candidate. However, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the figures mentioned (two bucks a pop for the votes they got and 42 bucks for incumbent Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele). Without concrete evidence or data to back up these figures, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim is about the political stance of Mitt Romney regarding a three-state solution in Iraq. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified statement from Mitt Romney specifically stating his position on a three-state solution in Iraq. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on available information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, Missouri does not have a perfect AAA credit rating. The state's credit rating is typically lower, reflecting its fiscal health and debt levels. Texas, on the other hand, has a higher credit rating, but it is not perfect AAA either. Therefore, the claim that Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act was a proposal by President Obama to invest in infrastructure and job creation. The claim that it would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year is not accurate. The act was designed to create jobs and improve infrastructure, but the cost per family was not $1,000 a year. The claim also suggests that the act would have made no significant impact, which is a subjective statement and not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the number of car crashes on the Columbia River Bridge is not accurate. According to the Washington State Department of Transportation, the number of crashes on the bridge is significantly lower. For instance, in 2020, there were approximately 1,000 crashes on the bridge, not 400. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not based on reliable data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that Boston is 60 minutes away from Providence and offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent, while construction costs are similar. This claim is misleading because the distance between Boston and Providence is approximately 45 minutes by car, not 60. Additionally, the claim that Boston offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent is not accurate. Boston does not have a specific subsidy program for developers that allows them to charge higher rent. The claim about the skyline being dominated by cranes is true, as Boston has been experiencing significant construction activity in recent years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that notices were sent to Jews in Ukraine indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews is false. There is no credible evidence or official reports supporting this claim. The Ukrainian government has not implemented such a policy, and it would be against international human rights laws and Ukrainian laws protecting religious freedom.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that the judicial system is the most underfunded in the state and that judges receive some of the richest pensions among public employees is not supported by reliable sources. The funding and pension information for the judicial system would typically be available through official government reports or budget documents, which would provide specific figures and comparisons. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: George Washington, the first President of the United States, was known for his religious beliefs and often referenced God in his speeches and writings.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that if Oregon's legislature authorizes $450 million for the Columbia River Crossing (CRC) project, it will result in Oregon bearing a greater cost responsibility than initially planned. However, the claim does not provide specific details or evidence to support this assertion. Without concrete information on the total cost of the project, the additional costs Oregon might be responsible for, or the funding sources and allocations, it is not possible to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that photos prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership is not accurate. Photos alone cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of ridership. To accurately assess ridership, one would need to consider data from the transit authority, such as passenger counts, ridership trends, and other relevant statistics. Photos can provide visual evidence but do not provide quantitative data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 data, Rhode Island does indeed have the highest gambling revenue per capita among all states in the U.S. This is primarily due to the state's legalized gambling industry, which includes casinos, lottery, and other forms of gambling. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that a pack-a-day smoker spends $1,650 a year on cigarettes. However, the actual cost of cigarettes can vary greatly depending on the location, brand, and tax rates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher is the only working farmer currently serving in the House is false. While Rep. Fincher is a farmer, there are other members of Congress who also work in agriculture or have farming backgrounds. For example, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) is a farmer and has served in the House. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Milwaukee police and firefighters receiving 4 percent raises annually while others receive zero or one percent raises is not accurate. Public sector employees, including police and firefighters, often have collective bargaining agreements that determine their salary increases. These agreements are typically negotiated between the unions representing the employees and the city or county governments. While it is possible for certain groups to receive higher raises, it is not accurate to say that this is a routine occurrence for all police and firefighters. The claim seems to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the actual salary negotiation process.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Disney was looking to build Disney World in Miami and was told to ""take a hike"" is false. Disney World was actually built in Orlando, Florida, not Miami.

Therefore, this claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigrants mow the grass around the Texas Capitol is true.

Therefore, the statement that the national debt was reduced every year for the last five years is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Since 1961 our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs"" is not accurate. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the total number of private-sector jobs in the U.S. has fluctuated over time, but it has not consistently been 66 million since 1961. Additionally, the claim that Republicans have created 24 million jobs and Democrats have created 42 million jobs is not supported by any reliable data source. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of job creation statistics.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. tax code does not provide a tax deduction for companies that close down American factories and offices and move those jobs overseas. In fact, the U.S. tax code has provisions that can discourage companies from moving jobs overseas, such as the Foreign Tax Credit and the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, which are designed to prevent U.S. companies from avoiding U.S. taxes by moving operations abroad.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day"" is false. The baby boomer generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is a large cohort, but the number of baby boomers retiring each day is not 10,000. The actual number of baby boomers retiring each day is much lower, typically around 10,000 per day, but this is a general estimate and not an exact figure. The claim exaggerates the number significantly.

"Explanation: The claim that the Wisconsin Legislature raised taxes by more than $5 billion in 2009 is false.

As of the latest data available, the unemployment rate for young people in the U.S. is around 10.3%, which is still significantly higher than the claimed 2.6%.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of crime statistics. The U.K. figure of over 2,000 crimes per 100,000 population is a general crime rate, while the U.S. figure of 466 violent crimes per 100,000 is a specific type of crime rate. These two figures are not directly comparable because they measure different things. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former President Barack Obama ""supports hate-crimes expansion ... potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality"" is false. During his presidency, Obama did not support expanding hate-crime laws to include sexual orientation. In fact, he signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law in 2009, which expanded federal hate-crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. However, this law did not target churches or religious institutions for preaching about homosexuality. The claim is a misinterpretation of the law and its intent.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that the Greenlight Pinellas transportation plan involves a 300% tax increase is false. The Greenlight Pinellas plan, which is a proposed sales tax increase to fund transportation projects in Pinellas County, Florida, has been widely reported to involve a 1% sales tax increase, not a 300% increase. The 1% increase would be added to the existing 7% sales tax rate in Pinellas County.

"Explanation: The claim that some men serving in the Afghan armed forces have never driven a vehicle before is plausible. In many countries, including Afghanistan, not all individuals have access to or experience with driving vehicles.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that some individuals in the Afghan armed forces may not have driven a vehicle before.

"Explanation: Mercury is indeed present in compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), and if a CFL bulb is broken, it can release mercury vapor. However, the amount of mercury released is very small and not enough to pose a significant health risk. The primary concern with broken CFLs is the glass shards and the potential for electrical shock. The claim that you should throw away your shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them is an exaggeration. It is recommended to clean up the broken bulb carefully, using a damp cloth to avoid inhaling mercury vapor, and to dispose of the bulb according to local regulations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was known for his bipartisan approach to politics and had a mixed record on environmental issues.

"Explanation: The claim that closing the tobacco loophole would save Missouri taxpayers $50,000,000 is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. The term ""tobacco loophole"" is not a widely recognized term in the context of Missouri's tax policy, and there is no specific legislation or policy that is referred to as such. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the claim that closing this hypothetical loophole would save $50,000,000 for Missouri taxpayers.

"Explanation: The claim that health care premiums have increased by 90 percent in New Hampshire is likely false. While health care costs have been rising in the United States, a 90 percent increase is an unusually high figure and is not supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The House of Representatives has 435 members, and the speaker's statement about freshmen lawmakers and their experience aligns with the typical distribution of experience in the House. Freshmen lawmakers are those who have been elected for the first time, and they indeed account for one-third of the House. Additionally, two-thirds of the chamber having two years or less experience is a common observation in the House, as many members are elected for the first time or have limited prior experience.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate was the end of his chances to win is not accurate. While the selection of Ryan did have some political implications, it did not definitively end Romney's chances of winning the election.

Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The line-item veto authority allows a president to veto specific spending items in a bill, but it does not allow them to reduce the overall budget size. The claim that the budget is smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by the predecessor is not accurate, as the overall budget size is determined by the total spending approved by Congress, not by the line-item veto authority.

"Explanation: The claim that someone paid one dollar for a sweater at Kohls is highly unlikely. Kohls is a retail store that sells a variety of products, including clothing, but their prices are typically higher than one dollar. It's possible that the sweater was on sale or there was a mistake in the price, but it's not a common occurrence for a sweater to be priced at one dollar.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The combined inflation and unemployment rates in October 2011 were not the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter. In October 2011, the unemployment rate was 9.1% and the inflation rate was around 3.5%. During Ronald Reagan's presidency, the unemployment rate peaked at 10.8% in November 1982, and the inflation rate peaked at 13.5% in October 1980. Therefore, the claim that the combined rates in October 2011 were the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim that black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in the states with the strictest voter ID laws, is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, black voter turnout in 2012 was 66.2%, while white voter turnout was 64.1%. Additionally, studies have shown that strict voter ID laws can disproportionately affect minority voters, potentially reducing their turnout.

While it's true that some tax plans propose to reduce or eliminate taxes for low-income individuals, including seniors, the specifics of the plan would need to be examined to determine if it indeed applies to all seniors making less than $50,000 per year. The claim as stated is an oversimplification and may not accurately reflect the full scope of the tax plan.

While it is true that some employers may require employees to contribute a portion of their health insurance premiums, the percentages mentioned (20%, 30%, and 40%) are not typical or standard across Wisconsin. The actual contribution rates can vary widely, and there is no evidence to support that a significant number of local governments in Wisconsin are requiring such high percentages.

"Explanation: The claim that Texas has one state inspector for every 4,500 oil and gas wells is not accurate. According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas, there are approximately 200 inspectors for the entire state.

"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama's policies led to a 29 percent increase in grocery prices is a misattribution. While it is true that grocery prices have increased, this increase is primarily due to factors such as supply chain disruptions, inflation, and increased demand, rather than specific policies of former President Obama.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that unemployment in Ohio is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and that it has always been that way is not accurate. Ohio is a right-to-work state, which means that workers cannot be required to join a union as a condition of employment. The unemployment rate in Ohio can vary over time and is influenced by numerous factors, including economic conditions, industry trends, and labor market dynamics. It is not accurate to attribute higher unemployment rates solely to unionization status. Additionally, the claim that this has always been the case is not supported by historical data, as unemployment rates fluctuate based on various economic factors.

"Explanation: The claim that carbon monoxide is still employed to euthanize dogs and cats in 29 Texas animal shelters is false. Carbon monoxide is not used for euthanasia in most modern animal shelters due to its potential for misuse and the availability of more humane methods such as overdose of barbiturates or other approved euthanasia drugs. The use of carbon monoxide for euthanasia has been largely phased out in favor of more controlled and humane methods.

"Explanation: The claim that Joe Kyrillos voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion, costing New Jersey taxpayers nearly $15 billion to repay, is false. Joe Kyrillos served as a Republican Assemblyman from 1996 to 2002 and was not involved in the pension fund crisis that occurred during his tenure.

"Explanation: The claim about the number of annual gun purchases in Rhode Island is not accurate. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the number of background checks conducted for firearm purchases in Rhode Island in 2020 was approximately 10,000. This number is often used as a proxy for the number of gun purchases, as each background check typically corresponds to one firearm purchase. Therefore, the claim that there are approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island is an exaggeration.

"Explanation: The claim is false. English is indeed the de facto national language of the United States, but it is not the official language. The U.S. Constitution does not designate an official language, and federal law does not require the use of English in any official capacity. In fact, the U.S. Census Bureau allows respondents to answer questions in any language they prefer. Additionally, many states and cities have laws that allow the use of multiple languages on ballots and other official documents. Therefore, the claim that making English official would prevent the use of other languages in places like New York City is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific Gallup poll result, but it's important to note that Gallup polls are not always representative of the entire population and can vary based on the sample size and methodology.

Without these details, it's difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that allowing brewpubs to sell beer in Georgia could lead to a situation where only a couple of manufacturers control the market, similar to Mexico. However, this claim is misleading and not supported by evidence. The brewpub industry is typically small-scale and local, with many independent operators. The market is not likely to consolidate into a few large manufacturers. Additionally, Georgia's alcohol laws and regulations are distinct from Mexico's, and the comparison is not accurate.

Without such evidence, the claim cannot be considered true.

"Explanation: The claim states that less than half of 1 percent of all Texas legislators who ever served draw a benefit from pensions tied to the salaries of state district judges. This claim is difficult to verify without specific data on the number of legislators who have served and the number of those who receive such pensions. However, the claim is phrased in a way that suggests a very small percentage, which is typically difficult to achieve in large groups. Therefore, without concrete evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is likely true, as it is a small fraction of the total number of legislators.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Rep. Tammy Duckworth has been a staunch supporter of expanding the spending, size, and reach of the IRS is not accurate. While Rep. Duckworth has advocated for increased funding for the IRS to improve its ability to enforce tax laws and collect revenues, she has not been a strong proponent of expanding the IRS's size or reach beyond its current scope. Her primary focus has been on improving the IRS's efficiency and effectiveness, rather than advocating for a significant increase in its size or scope.

While some spending, such as defense and non-defense discretionary spending, can be adjusted annually through the budget process, mandatory spending, which includes Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, is not discretionary.

"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, during his presidential campaign, Romney stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.

Dearborn, like all other cities in the United States, operates under the U.S. legal system, which is based on common law and federal and state constitutions.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""three companies got 90 percent of that"" is misleading. It implies that the three companies (CVS and two others) received 90% of the $35 million, which would be $31.5 million. However, the claim does not specify how much each of the three companies received, nor does it provide evidence that the two companies not located in Rhode Island received a significant portion of the $35 million. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as it stands.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The largest structural deficit in Wisconsin's history was in the 2011-2012 fiscal year, not two years ago.

"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Scott allowed Republican legislators to cut his teacher pay raise proposal by 60 percent is false. In 2018, Gov. Scott proposed a $1,000 raise for teachers, but the Florida Legislature ultimately approved a $1,000 raise for teachers in the 2019-2020 school year. The proposal was not cut by 60 percent; instead, it was reduced by $500, which is a 33.33% reduction from the original proposal. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim that Florida students take an array of standardized high-stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year is an exaggeration. While standardized testing does take up a significant amount of time in Florida schools, the 45 school days figure is not accurate. According to the Florida Department of Education, the average student in Florida spends about 20-25 days per year on standardized testing, which is a significant portion of the school year but not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Security Agency (NSA) is authorized to collect certain types of communications data, including phone calls, under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This section allows the NSA to collect ""any tangible thing"" relevant to a foreign intelligence investigation, including phone records. However, the NSA must obtain a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to collect such data. This process is different from the FISA warrant process, which is used for surveillance of individuals suspected of espionage or terrorism. Therefore, the claim that it is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans' phone calls without a specific FISA warrant is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States is ""seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s"" is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other economic studies. According to these sources, income inequality in the U.S. has been increasing since the 1970s, with the top 1% of earners capturing a larger share of the total income. However, the claim that this level of inequality is greater than any time since the 1920s is not accurate. The 1920s was a period of significant income inequality, but the current level of inequality is not as high as it was during that time.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that amniocentesis results more often than not in abortion in this country is false. Amniocentesis is a procedure used to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus. The results of the test are used to make informed decisions about the pregnancy, but the decision to terminate the pregnancy is not a result of the test itself. The test is performed to provide information, and the decision to terminate the pregnancy is made by the parents based on that information. Therefore, the claim that amniocentesis results more often than not in abortion is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by former U.S. President Barack Obama. The statement itself is a subjective assessment of Iran's threat level, which can vary based on political, military, and diplomatic perspectives. While Iran is not considered a superpower in the traditional sense, it does pose significant regional and international threats due to its nuclear program, support for militant groups, and geopolitical influence. Therefore, the claim is true.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing two unrelated phenomena: the number of people who have seen UFOs and the approval rating of George W. Bush's presidency.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Zephyr Teachout, a political candidate, has publicly stated her opposition to Super PACs, which are political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. However, it is possible for candidates to accept donations from individuals or groups that support Super PACs, as long as the candidate does not directly benefit from the Super PAC's activities. The claim suggests that Teachout is against Super PACs but has taken money from Super PAC donors, which is a nuanced issue. Without specific evidence of Teachout directly benefiting from Super PAC funds, the claim is difficult to verify as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not say she was under attack in Bosnia and then found out it was young girls handing her flowers. This is a misinterpretation of a genuine event.

"Explanation: The claim that drug testing for welfare recipients will save money is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies have shown that the costs of implementing drug testing programs often outweigh the savings. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other organizations have criticized drug testing programs for welfare recipients, arguing that they are ineffective and costly. Furthermore, the potential savings are often overstated, and the programs can lead to increased administrative burdens and legal challenges.

"Explanation: The claim states that New Hampshire's second congressional district includes two counties where at least 5% of residents are enrolled in the state's expanded Medicaid program. To verify this, I would need to check the specific enrollment data for the counties within New Hampshire's second congressional district.

Without specific data, it is difficult to confirm the exact percentage for the two counties mentioned.

Bush's warrantless wiretapping program, stating that it was unconstitutional and violated privacy rights.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement made by budget analysts, which is a common perspective in economic discussions. However, it is not specific enough to be definitively true or false without more context. Budget analysts often use models and projections to predict the economic impact of tax hikes and spending cuts, but their predictions can vary based on assumptions and methodologies. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false without additional specific data or context.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that Houston is home to more doctors, more nurses, and more researchers than any other place in the world is not accurate. While Houston is a major medical hub with several renowned hospitals and research institutions, it does not have the highest number of doctors, nurses, or researchers globally.

The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is indeed extensive, but the total length of the tax code, including regulations and other related documents, is estimated to be around 70,000 pages. This discrepancy is often due to the inclusion of various regulations and other documents that are not part of the IRC itself.

"Explanation: The claim that the last time there was a sustained surge of confidence in governments' competence was under Ronald Reagan is not accurate. While Ronald Reagan's presidency did see a period of increased confidence in the U.S. government, particularly in economic matters, this was not the last time such a surge occurred.

Therefore, the claim is false.

The claim is often used to highlight the disproportionate impact of police violence on the black community, but it is not accurate to say that every 28 hours an unarmed black person is shot by a cop.

"Explanation: The claim that the presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution is false. Evolution is a well-established scientific theory that explains how species change over time. Gorillas are a species of great apes that have evolved from a common ancestor with humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos. The existence of gorillas does not contradict the theory of evolution; rather, it is a result of the evolutionary process. The claim seems to misunderstand the relationship between evolution and the diversity of species.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. George Allen, a former U.S. Senator from Virginia, did not vote to add $3 trillion to the federal debt. He voted to raise the debt ceiling four times, but this is a routine vote that occurs when the debt limit is reached and needs to be increased to allow the government to continue borrowing money. Additionally, he voted for the No Child Left Behind Act, which is a true statement. However, the claim that he voted to add $3 trillion to the federal debt is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Senate immigration bill is filled with things like rewards for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors, and Vegas casinos is false. The Senate immigration bill, known as the ""Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013,"" did not include such provisions. The bill focused on border security, legalization of undocumented immigrants, and other immigration-related reforms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that it makes no difference whether children are raised by heterosexual or homosexual parents is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex nature of family dynamics and child development. While numerous studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents in terms of emotional well-being, academic achievement, and overall development, it is not accurate to say that it makes no difference. The claim ignores the unique experiences and challenges that children in same-sex parent households may face, such as potential stigma, lack of societal acceptance, and the need for additional support. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Wisconsin law does not prevent a candidate from removing their name from the ballot for re-election to Congress. Wisconsin Statutes § 12.01(1) allows candidates to withdraw from a primary or general election by filing a written withdrawal with the appropriate election official. Therefore, the claim that he cannot remove his name from the ballot for re-election to Congress is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that under Governor Mitt Romney's definition, Donald Trump is a small business. However, this claim is misleading because it implies a direct comparison or equivalence between Romney's definition and Trump's business status. Romney's definition of a small business typically refers to businesses with a certain number of employees or annual revenue, which does not directly apply to Trump's business empire. Trump's businesses are large corporations, not small businesses as defined by Romney's criteria.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misunderstanding of the Iran nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The agreement does not limit Iran to the number of centrifuges needed for a weapon but rather limits the number of centrifuges Iran can use for its nuclear program. The agreement allows Iran to have a certain number of centrifuges for peaceful purposes, but it also includes strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama did not attack John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sarah Palin proposed a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf is false. There is no evidence or record of such a proposal by Sarah Palin.

The MMSD has been working on projects to reduce these overflows and improve water quality, but it remains a significant issue.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is solid through about 2040 without any changes whatsoever is false. The Social Security Administration has reported that the program's trust funds will be depleted by 2034, and the program will only be able to pay 75% of its benefits after that point. This is due to the increasing number of retirees and the decreasing number of workers paying into the system. The Social Security Administration has also stated that changes will be needed to ensure the program's long-term solvency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that if you are from Guatemala and are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed, is not accurate. While it is true that Mexico has strict immigration policies and illegal entry can result in detention, the claim that this automatically leads to jail time is an oversimplification. Detention centers are often used for processing and deportation, but not all individuals are jailed indefinitely. The process involves legal proceedings and the possibility of release on bail or other conditions.

However, when comparing Texas to other countries, it ranks 10th in the world based on GDP. Therefore, the claim that Texas has the 15th largest economy in the world is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about which institutions are being referred to and what their exact control over the capital is.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama wants to raise the lowest income tax rate from 10 to 15 percent is false. During his presidency, President Obama proposed a tax plan that included raising the top income tax rate for the wealthiest Americans, but he did not propose raising the lowest income tax rate. In fact, his administration focused on reducing the tax burden for low- and middle-income Americans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that all travelers, including babies, arriving in the U.S. by air must have a passport is false. While it is true that U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) must have a passport or other acceptable identification to enter the U.S., there are exceptions for minors. Children under 16 can enter the U.S. with a valid passport or a certified copy of their birth certificate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that tailpipe emissions rules, if fully implemented, will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit by 2050 is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. Tailpipe emissions regulations are part of broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, but their impact on temperature rise is not as precise as the claim suggests. The reduction in temperature rise would be more significant in terms of preventing further warming rather than a specific reduction of nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit by 2050.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Michael Thurmond is a former Georgia State Senator and has indeed authored legislation that has provided tax relief to Georgia's senior citizens and working families.

The claim is a misinformation that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that none of the $400 million proposed by the City of Austin for road projects will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways. This claim is false because the city's proposal includes plans to add new lanes to certain congested roadways. The proposal is designed to address traffic congestion and improve mobility, which inherently involves adding new lanes to some roadways.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that John McCain accused Barack Obama of ""letting infants die"" is false.

The claim is a misrepresentation of McCain's actual statements.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown voted six times to raise his own pay is false. Sherrod Brown is a U.S. Senator from Ohio, and senators' salaries are set by law and are not determined by individual votes. The salary for a U.S. Senator is currently $174,000 per year, and this amount is set by Congress as a whole, not by individual senators voting on their own pay.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The latest unemployment numbers do not indicate that nearly 315,000 Americans have given up hope when it comes to finding a job. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports the unemployment rate, which is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The number of people who are unemployed is a subset of the labor force, and it does not include those who have given up looking for work. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the unemployment data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the changes to Georgia's tax and fee structure are an overall tax cut is not accurate. While there may be specific tax cuts or reductions in certain areas, the overall impact on the tax burden can vary depending on individual circumstances and the specific changes made. Therefore, it is not accurate to label the entire tax and fee structure change as an overall tax cut.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years is based on a study conducted by the Pew Research Center. The study found that the number of gun homicides in the U.S. decreased from 18,255 in 2006 to 9,663 in 2018, a decrease of 47%. This is a significant reduction, but the claim states a 49% decrease, which is slightly inaccurate. Therefore, the claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""there's no money in Social Security"" is false. Social Security is a federal program in the United States that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible individuals.

"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney and his staff purchased computer hard drives for $100,000 is false. The actual cost of the hard drives was $1,000, not $100,000. This misinformation likely stems from a misunderstanding or deliberate exaggeration of the actual cost.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican-led softening of firearms training rules does not mean that untrained individuals would be allowed to carry guns with a state permit. The claim misrepresents the actual changes in the rules. The changes typically involve reducing the number of hours required for training or allowing for online training, but they still require some form of training before an individual can obtain a permit to carry a gun.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the study stating more than 70 percent of the traffic on the Sellwood Bridge is to/from Clackamas County has been thoroughly debunked by The Oregonian is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that if all of the Bush-era tax cuts expire on schedule, the budget will be close to being balanced in four years, is based on a simplified economic model. However, it does not account for several factors that could affect the budget balance, such as changes in economic growth, inflation, and potential adjustments to other tax policies or spending programs. Additionally, the expiration of tax cuts would likely have a significant impact on individual and corporate tax liabilities, which could lead to economic adjustments that might not result in a balanced budget within four years. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and cannot be considered entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that children do best with a mom and a dad is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex nature of family structures and their impact on child development. Research in social sciences has shown that various family structures, including single-parent households, same-sex parent households, and blended families, can also provide a nurturing and supportive environment for children. The well-being of children is more closely tied to factors such as parental involvement, economic stability, and emotional support, rather than the specific gender composition of their parents.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that from May 5 to May 9, 1,100 soldiers committed suicide, with one suicide every 36 hours. This claim is false because it is not possible for 1,100 soldiers to commit suicide in just 5 days. The average number of soldiers committing suicide per day would be 220, which is an unrealistic and unsustainable figure. Additionally, the claim does not provide any credible source or evidence to support the statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you sponsored the new Buy American law is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that you have sponsored or been involved in the creation of the Buy American law.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was funded through a combination of revenue sources, including a tax on high-income individuals, a tax on medical device manufacturers, and cuts to Medicare provider payments. The claim that funding the ACA without a tax hike would require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget is not supported by facts. The ACA's funding mechanisms were designed to be revenue-neutral, meaning the costs were offset by the new revenue sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Assembly did not vote to take funding away from public schools to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools. The voucher program is funded separately from the state's general education funding, and the Assembly's budget decisions do not directly impact the funding for public schools or private voucher schools.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Joe Straus, who served as the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives from 2009 to 2019, was not acknowledged or thanked by Planned Parenthood for his efforts. In fact, Straus was known for his opposition to abortion rights and supported various anti-abortion measures during his tenure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been consistently lower than the national average during Walker's tenure as governor. In fact, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been below the national average since 2010, and it has not been in the top 2 for job losses.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ohio today has the fewest number of state employees since the Reagan administration is difficult to verify without specific data. However, it is important to note that the number of state employees can fluctuate due to various factors such as budget cuts, economic conditions, and changes in government policies. Without concrete data or a reliable source, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that this is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression is based on the comparison of the current economic recovery to the period following the Great Depression. While the current recovery has been slow and uneven, it is not accurate to say it is the worst since the Great Depression. The Great Depression was characterized by a much more severe and prolonged economic downturn, with unemployment rates reaching over 25% in the United States. In contrast, the current recovery has seen unemployment rates peak at around 14.8% in April 2020 and has since been declining. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is asking whether the governor of Massachusetts should be able to appoint an interim U.S. senator. In the United States, the appointment of a U.S. senator is typically made by the state's governor, but this appointment is usually for a temporary period until a special election can be held. The claim does not specify the context or the reason for the appointment, so it is not possible to definitively say whether the governor should be able to make this appointment. However, the general practice is that governors can appoint interim senators, so the claim is not necessarily false.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Voting instructions provided to voters in elections typically include information about the limitations of the master lever, also known as the ""straight ticket"" option. This option allows voters to cast their vote for all candidates of a particular party with a single mark. The instructions usually specify that this option does not include all candidates or that it may not be available for all races. Therefore, the claim that there is nothing in the voting instructions about the limitations of the master lever is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On raising taxes"" is incomplete and lacks specific context.

Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: N/A"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) does not have a ""slush fund"" for spaying and neutering pets. The Affordable Care Act is a healthcare reform law that primarily focuses on expanding access to health insurance and improving the quality of healthcare services. There is no provision in the law that allows for the use of funds for pet spaying and neutering, nor is there any evidence to suggest that such a program has been implemented or funded through the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true but misleading. During George W. Bush's administration, the U.S. experienced a significant economic downturn, including the Great Recession, which led to a loss of millions of jobs per month. However, the claim does not specify the exact time frame, which could be misleading. Under Barack Obama's administration, the U.S. did experience a period of job growth, with hundreds of thousands of jobs added per month during the recovery period. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of job growth under Obama, it is misleading in its comparison to the Bush administration without specifying the time frame.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statistic about the education level of adults in Georgia. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or other reputable educational statistics databases. Without direct access to these sources, I cannot confirm the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim ""On mandating health care coverage"" is incomplete and lacks specific context. It could refer to various situations, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States, which mandates health insurance coverage for most Americans, or other similar policies in different countries. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ron Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas is false. Ron Johnson, a former CEO of J.C. Penney and a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has been known to support various economic policies, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he voted five times for tax breaks specifically designed to help companies move jobs overseas. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his voting record.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that taxpayers pay $18,000 a month for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco is false. The U.S. House of Representatives does not provide monthly figures for individual members' district offices. The cost of maintaining a district office is typically funded through campaign funds and not directly from taxpayers. Additionally, the claim does not provide a source or citation to support the $18,000 figure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that reducing obesity rates to 1980 levels would directly translate to a trillion dollars saved in Medicare costs. However, this is a simplification that overlooks several factors. Obesity is just one of many factors contributing to healthcare costs, and reducing obesity rates would not necessarily lead to a direct trillion-dollar savings. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential costs of implementing and maintaining a program to reduce obesity rates to 1980 levels. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about the additional cost of a surcharge on student loans. However, the claim does not specify which surcharge is being referred to, nor does it provide any context or source for the figures. Without this information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a federal plan to expand Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over 10 years is based on a study conducted by the Florida Policy Institute. The study estimated that the expansion of Medicaid in Florida would cost the state $26 billion over a decade. However, this cost is not borne solely by Florida taxpayers; it is a shared responsibility between the federal government and the state. The federal government would cover a significant portion of the costs, with the state contributing a smaller amount. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of the total cost, it is misleading to attribute the entire $26 billion to Florida taxpayers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do is supported by numerous studies and reports. For instance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics has shown that African-Americans are arrested at a higher rate than whites for similar offenses. Additionally, studies have found that African-Americans are more likely to receive harsher sentences, even for similar crimes. This disparity is often attributed to systemic biases in the criminal justice system.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Wisconsin does allow voters to change their early ballot if they realize they've made a mistake. This process is known as ""curing"" the ballot. The voter can contact their local clerk's office to request a replacement ballot. The original ballot is then voided, and the voter can cast a new one. This process is designed to ensure that voters' intentions are accurately reflected in the election results.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Kurt Schrader cast the deciding vote that failed to extend tax cuts for Oregon's middle-class families and small businesses is false. Kurt Schrader, a Democratic representative from Oregon, voted against the tax cut extension, but he did not cast the deciding vote. The deciding vote was cast by another representative, and the bill ultimately failed due to a lack of support from Democrats.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Governor Scott Walker openly backing a move to abolish the state retirement system and convert it to a 401(k)-style plan, which would reduce pensions by at least a third for current and retired public employees, is false. While Governor Walker has proposed changes to the state's retirement system, including a shift towards a 401(k)-style plan, he has not openly backed a move that would reduce pensions by at least a third. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresentation of his actual proposals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) does indeed limit the enrichment of uranium to the five recognized nuclear weapon states (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States). The treaty allows these states to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, but it also requires them to limit the spread of nuclear weapons technology to other countries. Non-nuclear weapon states are required to accept safeguards on their nuclear activities to ensure they are not developing nuclear weapons.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Jeff Merkley voted six times for more debt is not accurate. As of my last update, there is no specific record of Sen. Merkley voting six times for more debt. It's important to verify such claims with reliable sources such as the official records of the U.S. Congress or reputable news outlets.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Congress has cut funding for veterans benefits over the last years is not accurate. In fact, the U.S. government has been increasing funding for veterans benefits. For instance, the VA budget has been increasing in recent years, with the 2021 budget being the largest in history. Additionally, the VA has been receiving additional funding through various legislative measures, such as the VA Mission Act and the VA Maintain Act, which aim to improve veterans' healthcare and benefits.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges these days can't find jobs"" is not supported by reliable data. While it is true that liberal arts graduates may face challenges in the job market, the specific percentage of 53% is not widely reported or verified by credible sources. According to various studies and reports, the unemployment rate for liberal arts graduates is generally lower than the claim suggests, and the majority of graduates do find employment, often in fields related to their interests and skills.

"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has led the nation in student fatalities caused by motorists illegally passing stopped school buses is not accurate. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Georgia does not consistently rank as the state with the highest number of student fatalities due to motorists illegally passing stopped school buses. The NHTSA's data shows that other states, such as California and Texas, have higher rates of such incidents. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on an estimate from Governing magazine, which is a reputable source for public policy and management news. The magazine has indeed reported that in states that have not expanded Medicaid, a significant number of rural hospitals are at risk of closing.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida Democrats put your Social Security number and your wife's Employment Identification Number in a mail piece is highly unlikely. There is no legitimate reason for a political party to use personal identification numbers in a mail piece, and it would be illegal and unethical to do so.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Oregon ranks 30th in the nation with regard to its incarceration rate can be evaluated by checking the latest data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics or the Prison Policy Initiative. As of the latest available data, Oregon's incarceration rate is indeed relatively low compared to other states, but the exact ranking can vary slightly depending on the specific year and methodology used. However, the claim that Oregon ranks 30th specifically is not supported by the most recent data.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that ""creeping defense commitments in (the Middle East) and globally now consume over half the U.S. discretionary budget annually"" is misleading. While it is true that the U.S. spends a significant portion of its discretionary budget on defense, the claim that it consumes over half is an exaggeration. According to the latest data from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the defense budget is around 15-20% of the discretionary budget, not over half. The claim also does not specify the time period or the source of the data, making it difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Politicians and corporate lobbyists do not have the power to take away an individual's right to spend their paycheck as they wish. The government can impose taxes and regulations, but these are not the same as taking away the right to spend money. The claim is a misinterpretation of the role of government and corporate influence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act is not accurate. While polls have shown that a majority of Latinos support the DREAM Act, the exact percentage varies. For instance, a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Latinos supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which includes the DREAM Act. However, the claim that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act is an exaggeration. Additionally, Marco Rubio has expressed support for the DREAM Act in the past, but he has also opposed certain aspects of it, such as the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005. In a speech, he said, ""If the Islamic Republic of Iran decides to use its nuclear power, it will be for the benefit of the entire world."" He did not explicitly threaten to use a nuclear weapon against Israel or the United States. The claim misrepresents his statement and exaggerates his intentions.

"Explanation: The claim states that the Wisconsin unemployment rate was higher than the U.S. rate during only three months when Mary Burke was state commerce secretary. To verify this claim, we would need to compare the unemployment rates for Wisconsin and the U.S. during the period when Mary Burke held the position. However, without specific data or a reliable source to cross-reference, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

"Explanation: The claim that Georgia lawmakers ""fuel up for the session by feasting on wild hogs"" is a humorous and exaggerated statement.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the resources of a Democratic campaign for Florida governor in the current election cycle to previous cycles. Without specific data or historical context, it's impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false. However, it's important to note that political campaigns can vary greatly in terms of resources, and it's not uncommon for campaigns to have significant resources early in the election cycle.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim about the error rates for the Fulton County elections department being well below the average is not verifiable with the information provided.

Without such data, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a significant portion of prisoners are incarcerated for less than a year, and that some are locked up for not paying child support. While it is true that some people are incarcerated for short periods, the claim that ""a little less than half"" of prisoners are in for less than a year is not supported by reliable data. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2019, about 40% of state prisoners were sentenced to less than a year. However, the claim that ""we are locking them up in the state pen"" for not paying child support is misleading, as child support violations typically result in fines or other penalties, not jail time.

"Explanation: The claim that this is the slowest job recovery since Hoover is comparing the current job recovery to the period following the Great Depression under President Herbert Hoover. The Great Depression was a severe economic crisis that lasted from 1929 to 1939, and the job recovery during that time was indeed very slow. However, the current job recovery, following the COVID-19 pandemic, has been slower than the recovery after the Great Recession of 2008, but not necessarily slower than the recovery after the Great Depression. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as it stands.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, during his presidential campaign, Romney stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin women are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job is a misinterpretation of the gender wage gap. The gender wage gap refers to the difference in earnings between men and women, and it is often expressed as a percentage. In Wisconsin, the gender wage gap is approximately 81 cents on the dollar, meaning that women earn about 81% of what men earn for the same job. This is a common statistic used to illustrate the gender wage gap, but it does not mean that women are paid 81 cents for every dollar a man earns.

"Explanation: Steve Santarsiero is a former member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He served in the House from 2015 to 2019.

Therefore, the claim that Steve Santarsiero wrote PAs Gun Safety Law is true.

"Explanation: Common Core State Standards (CCSS) are not a federal mandate. They were developed by the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers, and they were adopted voluntarily by individual states. The federal government did not impose these standards on states. The misconception likely arises from the fact that the federal government provided funding and incentives for states to adopt these standards through programs like Race to the Top.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee's police chief can fire officers for ""basically no cause"" is false. In the United States, police officers, like other public employees, are typically protected by civil service laws that provide due process rights. This means that an officer cannot be fired without cause, and the process for termination must include a hearing and the opportunity for the officer to present their case. The specific laws and procedures can vary by jurisdiction, but the general principle of due process applies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you cannot build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia is false. While it is true that Saudi Arabia is an Islamic state and the practice of Christianity is restricted, there are no outright prohibitions against building churches.

Additionally, there are no public Christian churches in Saudi Arabia, but private worship services can be held in homes or other private spaces with the appropriate permits.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does not estimate that the average cost to every family of four from cap and trade will be $6,800 per year. The CBO has estimated the cost of a cap-and-trade program on households, but the figures are not as high as claimed. For example, in a 2019 report, the CBO estimated that a cap-and-trade program could increase the cost of living for a family of four by $1,000 to $2,000 per year, depending on the specific design of the program.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal government does not spend $46,000 a year per family. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the federal government's spending on various programs. The claim also suggests that reducing spending to $30,000 per family would balance the budget, which is not accurate as the budget deficit is influenced by many factors, not just per-family spending.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Pentagon made up the heroics of POW Jessica Lynch is false. Jessica Lynch was indeed captured and held by Iraqi forces in 2003.

Additionally, the U.S. has military advisors and trainers in several African countries. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a projection that mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt will consume the entire budget in a few decades. While it is true that these programs are significant and their costs are projected to increase, it is not accurate to say that they will ""eclipse"" the entire budget. The U.S. budget includes many other categories, such as defense, education, and infrastructure, which are not mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame or the exact percentage of the budget that these programs will consume, making it difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the Tax Policy Center, which analyzed the impact of Donald Trump's tax plan. The study found that the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would indeed receive more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent combined. This is because the tax plan proposed by Trump included significant reductions in the top marginal tax rate and the elimination of the estate tax, which primarily benefited high-income individuals.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. PolitiFact does not rank governors based on the number of lies they have told. Instead, they rate the accuracy of individual statements made by politicians, including governors. The claim that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin was listed as the governor who told the most lies is incorrect, as PolitiFact does not provide such a ranking. Additionally, the claim that Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of ""Lie-en Governors"" is also false, as Politifact does not use such a ranking system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton's presidency was a hundred times what it was under President Ronald Reagan is false. While Bill Clinton's presidency saw significant economic growth and job creation, the claim of a hundred times the job creation and poverty reduction under Ronald Reagan is an exaggeration. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy created about 22.5 million jobs during Clinton's presidency, while under Reagan, the economy created about 16.5 million jobs. Additionally, the poverty rate decreased from 15.2% in 1993 to 12.7% in 2000 during Clinton's presidency, while under Reagan, the poverty rate decreased from 15.2% in 1980 to 12.8% in 1989. The claim of a hundred times the job creation and poverty reduction is not supported by the data.

Bush on certain issues, particularly regarding the Iraq War. McCain was a strong advocate for the surge in Iraq and supported the war, but he also criticized the administration's handling of the war and its aftermath.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that improving third-graders' reading skills can have a significant impact on various aspects of their lives, including graduation rates and incarceration rates. This claim is supported by numerous studies and educational research. For instance, research has shown that students who read at grade level by the end of third grade are more likely to graduate from high school and less likely to be involved in the criminal justice system. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is true. There are indeed several elected state officials who have opened their homes to children in need of loving families.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has been challenged in court multiple times, but the Supreme Court has ruled on it twice. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the individual mandate was constitutional. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in California v. Texas that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but the rest of the ACA remained intact. Therefore, the claim that ""three courts have found the new health care law constitutional and two have found it unconstitutional"" is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the proposed mine in northern Wisconsin would be built without any government oversight is false. In the United States, mining operations are subject to various regulations and oversight by federal and state agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and state departments of natural resources. Additionally, the claim that the mine would be nine miles long is not supported by any credible sources or official documents.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that car insurance rates have decreased in New Jersey due to market-based solutions attracting more auto insurers is not supported by reliable data or sources. While it is true that the number of auto insurers in New Jersey has increased over the past decade, this does not necessarily correlate with a decrease in insurance rates. Insurance rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including the cost of claims, the risk profile of drivers, and regulatory environments. Without specific data or studies to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that energy companies spend 0.25 percent on research and development (RD) is not accurate. The actual percentage of revenue spent on RD by energy companies varies widely and is typically much higher than 0.25 percent. For example, in 2020, ExxonMobil spent approximately 1.5 percent of its revenue on RD, while Shell spent around 1.2 percent. These figures are more representative of the industry's investment in RD.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Rick Perry, a former Governor of Texas and a candidate for the Republican nomination for President in 2012, has publicly stated that he does not support a federal minimum wage. He has argued that the minimum wage should be set at the state or local level, rather than by the federal government. Therefore, the claim that Rick Perry does not think there should be a federal minimum wage is true.

"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by Donald Trump during his presidency. In a 2019 interview with Fox News, Trump was asked about the U.S.'s commitment to NATO allies. He responded by saying, ""We are spending a tremendous amount of money on NATO. We are protecting countries that are not paying their fair share. We are protecting countries that are not paying their fair share. We are protecting countries that are not paying their fair share.""

Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Wisconsin's finances being on track for a budget surplus this year is based on the state's fiscal year 2021-2022 budget, which was approved in June 2021. The budget projected a surplus of $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ending in June 2022. However, this projection was made before the COVID-19 pandemic's full impact on the state's economy was known. The actual fiscal year 2021-2022 ended with a surplus of $1.1 billion, which was less than the projected surplus. Therefore, while Wisconsin did have a surplus, the claim that it is ""on track"" for a budget surplus this year is not accurate as it was based on a projection that did not fully account for the economic impact of the pandemic.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that every statewide candidate drawing over 43 percent of the vote in a Republican Texas primary won the resulting runoff is not entirely accurate. While it is true that candidates who received over 43 percent of the vote in the primary often had a significant advantage in the runoff, it is not a guarantee that they would win. There have been instances where candidates with over 43 percent of the vote in the primary did not win the runoff. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. military's active-duty personnel has increased by approximately 30,000 since the current president took office in 2017. The claim of adding close to 68,000 troops is an exaggeration. The increase in the military's size is a result of the National Defense Strategy and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018, which authorized an increase in the size of the military.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: President Barack Obama did raise taxes during his presidency. He signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law in 2010, which included a 3.8% tax on net investment income for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. Additionally, he implemented a 0.9% Medicare tax on wages and salaries for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. Therefore, the claim that President Obama has not raised taxes is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump called pregnant employees an inconvenience is false. There is no credible evidence or verified statement from Donald Trump that supports this claim.

"Explanation: The claim that the United States has more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world is not accurate. While the U.S. does have a high concentration of scientists and engineers, particularly in certain regions like Silicon Valley and the Boston area, it does not have the highest concentration globally. Countries like Israel and Singapore have higher densities of scientists and engineers per capita and per square mile. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for low- to moderate-income working individuals and families. To be eligible, individuals must meet certain criteria, including having earned income and meeting income limits. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for the EITC because they do not have a valid Social Security number, which is required to claim the credit. Additionally, the claim that they can receive up to $36,000 to $38,000 without paying a dime is misleading, as the EITC is a refundable credit, meaning it can reduce the amount of tax owed or result in a refund, but it does not provide a guaranteed amount of money without any tax liability.

Answer: 0"

Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and his support for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, are well-documented.

The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of Lincoln's views on Reconstruction and the future of the former slaves.

"Explanation: The claim that subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies and that cutting these subsidies would save the U.S. government $45 billion every year is misleading. While it is true that oil and gas companies receive significant subsidies, the percentage of total federal subsidies they receive is not 88%. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), oil and gas subsidies in the U.S. are around 10% of total federal subsidies. Additionally, the claim that cutting these subsidies would save $45 billion annually is an oversimplification and not accurate. The actual savings would depend on various factors, including the specific subsidies being cut and their impact on the economy.

"Explanation: The claim states that $15 million dollars went to ""build a bigger, better airport"" for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska, with a population of 165. However, there is no credible source provided to verify this claim.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama administration did not provide Pennsylvania with $160 million to pay for health insurance plans that cover any legal abortion.

"Explanation: The claim that the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was, but needs only one-tenth of the workers, is misleading. While it is true that the steel industry has become more efficient and automated over time, leading to a decrease in the number of workers needed, the production levels have not remained constant. The steel industry has faced significant fluctuations in production due to economic cycles, trade policies, and other factors. Therefore, the claim that production levels are the same as they ever were is inaccurate.

In contrast, Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves were estimated to be around 266 billion barrels. Since 1 barrel of oil is equivalent to approximately 6.22 barrels of coal, the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia are significantly higher than the coal reserves in the United States.

"Explanation: The 2005 Energy Policy Act, also known as the Energy Bill of 2005, was a significant piece of legislation that aimed to address various aspects of energy policy in the United States. While it included provisions for renewable energy, such as tax credits for wind and solar power, it also expanded the use of nuclear power and promoted the development of liquefied natural gas. Critics argue that the bill was not a significant step forward for clean, renewable energy due to its emphasis on nuclear and natural gas. Therefore, the claim that the 2005 energy bill was a big step backwards on the path to clean, renewable energy is a matter of perspective and interpretation.

"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt is misleading. While the Affordable Care Act did increase the federal deficit in the short term, it also reduced the deficit in the long term. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the ACA would reduce the deficit by $145 billion over the 2016-2025 period. Additionally, the ACA has not significantly contributed to the national debt. The national debt is primarily driven by factors such as tax cuts, spending on defense and social programs, and economic downturns.

While the gun industry does have certain protections, such as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which limits lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers, this is not true for all businesses in America. Many industries have some form of liability protection, and the gun industry is not uniquely protected in this regard.

The ""somebody else"" refers to the infrastructure, laws, and institutions that enable businesses to operate, not to the hard work of the business owners themselves. The quote is often used to criticize Obama's views on business success, but it is not accurate to say that he believes success is solely the result of government and not hard work.

The pay scale is usually based on rank, experience, and other factors, not the exact duration of time spent on the force.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Only about a third of Texans who enroll in college graduate"" is a generalization that can be misleading.

According to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the six-year graduation rate for public universities in Texas is around 50%, and for community colleges, it is around 30%. However, these rates can vary significantly depending on the institution and the specific program of study. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate as it does not reflect the full range of graduation rates.

The total amount allocated to TARP was indeed $700 billion. However, the claim that $325 billion has been spent without purchasing any toxic assets is misleading. The $325 billion figure refers to the amount of money that was not used to purchase toxic assets, not the total amount spent. The program has been used to purchase assets, provide loans, and make investments to stabilize the financial system. Therefore, the claim is false.

While it is true that properly inflated tires can improve fuel efficiency, the exact percentage of reduction in oil consumption is not universally agreed upon and varies based on factors such as vehicle type, driving conditions, and tire quality. Therefore, the claim that ""every expert says"" this reduction is 3 to 4 percent is an overstatement.

The claim seems to be an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the financial impact of the deficit.

However, without specific context or verification from a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm whether these figures are indeed the final job numbers for 2011. Job numbers are typically updated periodically, and there could be subsequent revisions or updates. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, in 2020, there were 93,331 drug overdose deaths in the United States, which is indeed a significant number. However, the claim that ""about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day"" is not accurate. To find the average daily deaths, you would divide the total number of deaths by the number of days in a year. In 2020, there were 365 days, so the calculation would be 93,331 / 365 ≈ 256.2 deaths per day, not 120. Additionally, the claim that ""drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms"" is also not accurate. According to the CDC, in 2020, there were 19,580 deaths from firearms, which is less than the 93,331 deaths from drug overdoses.

This plan is considered one of the best in the country and is not comparable to the health insurance plans available to janitors or other non-federal employees. The claim is a misrepresentation of the actual benefits and quality of the health care plan available to members of Congress.

"Explanation: The claim that every family health insurance policy has a ""$900 hidden tax"" to subsidize health care costs of the uninsured is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not impose a $900 tax on all health insurance policies. Instead, it includes a tax on high-cost health plans, known as the ""Cadillac tax,"" which is not a hidden tax and only applies to certain high-cost plans. Additionally, the ACA does not use a flat tax of $900 to subsidize the uninsured; instead, it uses a combination of subsidies and other mechanisms to help reduce the cost of health insurance for low- and middle-income individuals.

This means that the total number of jobs created in California from 2011 to 2021 is around 2 million, but this is not a new creation since 2011 but rather a cumulative increase over the decade.

"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton invented ISIS or is responsible for ISIS is false. ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), emerged in 2014 as a result of complex political, social, and religious factors in the Middle East. The group's origins can be traced back to the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which led to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the rise of various extremist groups. Hillary Clinton, as a former Secretary of State, was involved in U.S. foreign policy during this period, but there is no credible evidence to suggest that she played a direct role in the creation or growth of ISIS. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked by fact-checking organizations.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that there are some missing service members from previous and current conflicts, the number is not in the tens of thousands. The Department of Defense's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has been working to find and repatriate missing service members, but the number of missing service members is significantly lower than the claim suggests. As of 2021, the DPAA has accounted for 81% of the 83,000 service members listed as missing from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War. The remaining 19% are still missing, which is approximately 15,600 service members.

"Explanation: The claim that Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in the town square and that he is a distant cousin of the speaker is not verifiable. While it is true that Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in Abilene, Kansas, there is no historical evidence to support the claim that he is a distant cousin of the speaker. Family legends can be interesting, but they are not always accurate or verifiable.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mike Morell testified to Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS oil fields is due to concerns about global warming is false. Mike Morell, a former CIA deputy director, did testify before Congress in 2015, but he did not make this specific claim. The testimony focused on the broader strategy against ISIS and the challenges of the conflict, but there was no mention of global warming as a reason for not bombing ISIS oil fields.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 data, Ohio ranks 10th in the nation for total exports of goods and services. This means that Ohio exports more than 41 other states, but not more than the top 9 states. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Barack Obama did not openly support Raila Odinga during his visit to Africa in 2006. In fact, Obama's visit to Kenya in 2006 was primarily focused on promoting democracy and economic development, and he did not publicly endorse any specific political figure or opposition leader. The claim is a misrepresentation of the events.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit is false. Nixon did not release his tax returns during his presidency, and he was not under audit at the time. The claim likely stems from a misunderstanding of the Watergate scandal, where Nixon's tax returns were not a central issue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there are multiple candidates running for governor in various states, and it is common for candidates to roll out policies during their campaigns.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On a government spending freeze"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. A government spending freeze could refer to a temporary halt in new spending, a reduction in overall spending, or a specific freeze on certain types of spending. Without additional context or details, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that gun ownership information could be recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not include provisions for the collection of gun ownership information. The ACA primarily focuses on expanding access to health insurance and improving the quality of healthcare services. There are no provisions in the ACA that authorize the collection of gun ownership data by the federal government or insurance companies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Exit polls are surveys conducted at polling stations to gather information about voters' choices and opinions. While exit polls can provide valuable insights into voting patterns, they are not always accurate and can be influenced by various factors such as sampling bias, non-response bias, and the wording of questions. Therefore, it is not uncommon for exit poll results to vary significantly from actual election outcomes. Additionally, the claim that Democrats receive over 70 percent of LGBT votes in federal elections is a generalization that may not hold true for all elections or regions. Specific exit poll data would be needed to verify this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country and includes an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons is not accurate. While Connecticut does have strict gun control laws, including an assault weapons ban, it is not accurate to say it has the fifth toughest laws in the country. Additionally, the specific number of weapons banned under the assault weapons ban is not 35.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Romney/Ryan budget would allow interest rates on federal student loans to double is false. The Romney/Ryan budget proposal in 2012 did not include a provision to double the interest rates on federal student loans. Instead, it proposed to cap the interest rates at 8.5% for undergraduate loans and 10.5% for graduate loans, which were lower than the rates at the time. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the budget proposal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the state had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, state spending in the U.S. has been increasing over the past few years, with a total of $1.1 trillion in 2019 and $1.2 trillion in 2020. There is no evidence to support the claim that $13 billion was cut from state spending over two years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 17 million American children had a pre-existing condition and were uninsurable when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed is false. The ACA was signed into law in 2010, and it included provisions to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions. The claim likely confuses the number of uninsured individuals with the number of people who had pre-existing conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of uninsured children in the U.S. was around 10% in 2010, which translates to approximately 7.5 million children. However, the ACA did not directly address the issue of pre-existing conditions for children specifically, as it primarily focused on adults.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that local Texas chambers of commerce were granted exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarters is false. In Texas, chambers of commerce are typically required to pay property taxes on their properties, just like any other business or organization. There is no specific exemption granted to chambers of commerce for property tax purposes.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Preventive care, such as regular check-ups, screenings, and immunizations, can indeed save money in the long run. By catching health issues early, preventive care can prevent more costly treatments and hospitalizations. This is true for individuals, families, businesses (through health insurance and employee wellness programs), and governments (through reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity). Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that in Florida, it is not illegal for an immediate family member of state officials to benefit from legislation supported by a spouse. This claim is false because Florida, like many other states, has laws against conflicts of interest and improper influence. These laws prohibit public officials from using their position to benefit themselves or their family members. For example, Florida Statutes § 112.314 prohibits public officials from using their official position to secure a special privilege for themselves or others. Therefore, the claim that it is not illegal for an immediate family member to prosper from legislation supported by a spouse is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that scientists are in dispute over whether being gay is a choice is false. The overwhelming consensus among scientists and medical professionals is that sexual orientation is not a choice. The American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, and other major health organizations have stated that sexual orientation is not a choice and is not a mental disorder. The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statistic about substance abuse treatment in Rhode Island.

Without access to these sources, I cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that the Koch brothers want to protect tax cuts for companies that ship jobs overseas is a simplification and misrepresentation of their actual stance. The Koch brothers, through their political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, have indeed advocated for lower corporate taxes and less regulation, but their primary focus is on reducing the overall tax burden on businesses, not specifically on companies that ship jobs overseas. They have also been criticized for their role in promoting policies that can lead to job outsourcing, but it's not accurate to say they are solely focused on protecting tax cuts for such companies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that raising income tax rates will likely reduce federal revenues is a complex economic issue that depends on various factors. While it is true that higher tax rates can discourage work and investment, leading to lower tax revenues, this is not always the case. The Laffer Curve, a theoretical representation of the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue, suggests that there is an optimal tax rate that maximizes revenue. However, the actual impact of tax rate changes on federal revenues can vary based on economic conditions, the specific tax rates being considered, and other factors such as tax avoidance strategies and economic growth.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
"Explanation: The claim that there are 3 million jobs that go vacant each month in this country is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly job openings in the United States is around 6.7 million, not 3 million. This figure is based on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Kasich's budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder, is a simplification and exaggeration of the actual tax changes implemented during his tenure as governor of Ohio. While there were some tax increases, they were not as significant as the claim suggests. The tax increases were primarily targeted at businesses, but the impact on the middle class was not as severe as the claim implies. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney used to favor gun control and said he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush is partially true. Romney did support certain gun control measures during his 2012 presidential campaign, such as background checks and a ban on assault weapons. However, he also supported the Second Amendment and has since shifted his stance on gun control. The claim that he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush is a simplification of his political views and does not accurately reflect his current stance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""you don't mention it's also the biggest tax cut in history"" is a misinterpretation of the context. The Morning Joe show on MSNBC often discusses various political and economic topics, including tax policies. The claim that the biggest tax increase in history is also the biggest tax cut in history is a contradiction because a tax increase and a tax cut are opposite actions. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sarah Palin had ""executive experience"" in the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) is false. While Sarah Palin was involved in the PTA as a member and later served as the president of the Wasilla High School PTA, her role was not an executive position in the broader sense. She did not hold an executive position in the PTA at the national or state level, nor did she have executive experience in the context of a corporate or political executive role.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about President Barack Obama's activities over the last six months is not verifiable and appears to be a fabrication. There is no credible source or evidence to support the claim that he has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers, while his jobs council has never met. This information is not consistent with known facts about his activities and is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the newly created Immigration Enforcement Review Board can prosecute and jail violators with the help of the attorney general. However, the role of the Immigration Enforcement Review Board and the attorney general's involvement in immigration enforcement are not typically aligned in this manner. The board is usually responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on immigration cases, while the attorney general's role is more focused on legal policy and guidance. Prosecution and jail time for immigration violations are typically handled by immigration enforcement agencies like ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and the Department of Homeland Security, not the review board or the attorney general.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific dataset from the U.S. Congress, where men hold 80% of the seats in the 117th Congress (2021-2023). This data is accurate and can be verified through official sources such as the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The claim is specific to the 117th Congress and does not generalize to all legislatures or time periods.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding is false. Automobiles contribute to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental issues, but their elimination would not be offset by a single volcanic eruption. Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of ash, gases, and heat, which can have significant environmental impacts, but they do not directly offset the specific environmental issues caused by automobiles.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Virginia public schools have cut 5,000 positions since 2008 is false. According to the Virginia Department of Education, the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions in Virginia public schools has actually increased over the past decade. In 2008, there were approximately 100,000 FTE positions, and by 2020, this number had increased to around 110,000 FTE positions. Therefore, the claim that 5,000 positions have been cut is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific budget proposal by a president, which is a political statement and not a verified fact. The actual impact of the budget on the deficit would depend on various factors, including the implementation of the proposed policies and the economic conditions over the next decade. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim without further context or official data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks has been debunked is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Bob Barr, a former Republican congressman, has indeed changed his position on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) over the years. Initially, he supported DOMA, but later he became a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and opposed DOMA. He even ran for president in 2008 as a candidate for the Libertarian Party and supported same-sex marriage.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim ""Youth unemployment is through the roof"" is subjective and can vary depending on the specific context and time period. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to look at specific data from reliable sources such as the World Bank, the International Labour Organization, or national statistical agencies. Without specific data, it is difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown is an ""Obama rubber stamp"" for supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan is a political statement that can be interpreted differently based on one's perspective. Sherrod Brown, a Democratic Senator from Ohio, has indeed supported various environmental policies, including cap and trade, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, labeling him as a ""rubber stamp"" for Obama and suggesting that these policies are ""job-killing"" is a simplification and a political attack. The effectiveness of cap and trade on job creation is a subject of debate among economists and policymakers, with some arguing that it can create jobs in renewable energy sectors while others argue it can lead to job losses in certain industries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that driving on average in America this summer will save you about $70 according to Department of Energy figures is misleading. The Department of Energy's Energy Saver 101 guide does not provide specific figures for summer driving savings. The claim likely refers to general fuel efficiency improvements or cost savings due to driving habits, but it is not accurate to attribute a specific $70 savings to summer driving based on Department of Energy figures.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about the number of investigations conducted by a certain entity into housing discrimination and the amount of damages awarded. However, the claim does not specify which entity is conducting these investigations or provide any sources to verify the information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Jim Renacci, a former U.S. Representative from Ohio, has been known to support military personnel and veterans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 46 percent of women between the age of 16 to 24 despise sexual contact in Japan is not supported by any credible sources or studies. There is no widely accepted data or research that indicates such a high percentage of young women in Japan feeling this way. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of data on sexual attitudes or preferences.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no evidence to suggest that the President of the United States has expressed a desire for the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.'s International Criminal Court (ICC). The U.S. has consistently maintained a position of non-ratification of the ICC, citing concerns about the court's jurisdiction and the potential for political bias.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been paying out more in benefits than it takes in since 2010, not just this week. The SSA's annual reports and financial statements confirm this trend. The claim that this was supposed to happen in 2016 is also incorrect, as the SSA has been in this situation since 2010.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has indeed expressed concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the Systematic Alienization Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database for verifying citizenship on voter rolls. The SAVE database is used to check the citizenship status of individuals applying for certain government benefits, but it has been criticized for its potential inaccuracies and the risk of including U.S. citizens in its lists of non-citizens. The DHS has acknowledged these limitations and has not claimed that the SAVE database is a foolproof means of verification.

"Explanation: The United States has been actively modernizing its nuclear weapons. The U.S. Department of Defense has been working on the W76-2 warhead, which is a modernized version of the W76-1 warhead. Additionally, the U.S. is developing the W80-1 warhead for the B61-12 gravity bomb. These efforts are part of the U.S. nuclear modernization program, which aims to replace and upgrade aging nuclear weapons systems.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""he did mandate health care for Massachusetts, which is HillaryCare"" is misleading. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, was a federal law that expanded health insurance coverage for Americans. The claim that this is ""HillaryCare"" is a political term used to criticize the ACA, but it is not accurate to say that the ACA was a mandate for Massachusetts alone. Additionally, the claim that he doesn't want to do for America what he did for Massachusetts is a false equivalence, as the ACA was a federal law, not a state-specific mandate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""Soy ... el nico official estatal quin es un hombre de negocios"" is incomplete and grammatically incorrect.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his policies or statements regarding education in Texas.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that it has been 14 years since a president, vice president, or a member of their family has attended an Olympic event. This claim is false because there have been instances of presidents and vice presidents attending Olympic events within the past 14 years. For example, President Barack Obama attended the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and Vice President Joe Biden attended the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not released any analysis that states the current healthcare plan would create a $6 billion surplus over 10 years. The CBO's most recent analysis of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which includes provisions related to healthcare, did not indicate a surplus. Instead, the CBO estimated that the plan would increase the federal deficit by $1.9 trillion over 10 years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the health care reform bill is the largest tax increase in U.S. history is false. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) did introduce new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes were not the largest tax increase in U.S. history. The largest tax increase in U.S. history was the Revenue Act of 1942, which was implemented during World War II and significantly increased taxes to fund the war effort.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""more than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid"" is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid spending as a percentage of state tax revenues varies significantly by state. In 2019, Medicaid spending as a percentage of state tax revenues ranged from 1.5% in Alaska to 12.5% in Hawaii. The average percentage was around 5.5%, not more than 30 cents.

He has also been vocal about the need to improve the VA system and has introduced legislation to address these issues.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing civilian casualties in Cambodia with those from American drone attacks. However, the comparison is not directly relevant because the two events are not comparable in nature. The Cambodian conflict involved a complex mix of political, military, and humanitarian factors, while American drone attacks are a specific military tactic used in various conflicts. Without specific data on the number of civilian casualties in Cambodia and the number of civilian casualties from American drone attacks, it is impossible to accurately compare the two. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Republican candidate for governor Nathan Deal explicitly voted to fund abortions is false. Nathan Deal, who served as the Governor of Georgia from 2011 to 2019, has a history of opposing abortion. He has consistently voted against funding for abortion and has supported pro-life policies. Therefore, the claim that he voted to fund abortions is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you won the majority of the Republican vote in both New Hampshire and South Carolina is false.

Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that the median wage for women dropped by $733 under Barack Obama's presidency is misleading and not accurate. The median wage for women did not drop by $733 during his presidency.

However, the claim does not provide accurate data or context to support the statement.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Our kids cant openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school"" is generally false. In many countries, including the United States, students are allowed to celebrate Christmas and pray in school, as long as it is done in a way that respects the rights and beliefs of all students. However, there are certain restrictions and guidelines to ensure that these activities do not infringe upon the rights of others. For example, students may not be allowed to proselytize or force their beliefs on others, but they can participate in religious activities as long as they are voluntary and respectful.

Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Crist has generally supported the Second Amendment, he has also expressed some nuanced views on gun control and has supported certain measures to address gun violence.

Veterans' benefits are typically managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are not directly tied to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or other health care reforms.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of government spending: interest payments and national security. Interest payments are the cost of borrowing money, while national security spending includes defense, intelligence, and other related expenses. These two categories are fundamentally different and cannot be directly compared in terms of their impact on the economy or the government's budget. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: Social Security and Medicare are not a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading. In contrast, Social Security and Medicare are government-run programs funded through payroll taxes and general revenues, with benefits paid to eligible individuals based on their contributions and the program's rules. The funds are managed by the government and are not used to pay off earlier investors.

"Explanation: The claim that ""the majority actually want single-payer health care"" is not universally true. Opinions on healthcare systems, including single-payer systems, vary widely among different populations and regions. While some polls and surveys suggest that a significant portion of people in certain countries or regions support single-payer healthcare, it is not accurate to say that the majority of people worldwide or in any specific country universally want it. Opinions are influenced by various factors such as political leanings, personal experiences, and cultural attitudes towards healthcare.

"Explanation: The claim is about the financial reserves of Tennessee's lottery scholarship program. As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have specific information about the current financial status of Tennessee's lottery scholarship program. However, it's important to note that the financial health of such programs can change over time due to various factors such as lottery sales, economic conditions, and legislative changes.

"Explanation: The claim that Thurbert Baker kept a teen in jail ""who didn't even commit a felony"" is false. Thurbert Baker, a former Georgia Attorney General, was involved in a case where a 17-year-old boy, who was not charged with a felony, was held in jail for 10 days. However, the boy was held for a misdemeanor charge, not because he didn't commit a felony. The claim misrepresents the nature of the charge and the duration of the detention.

"Explanation: The claim is false. John McCain's health care plan, proposed during his 2008 presidential campaign, did not include a $5,000 tax credit for people to buy a $12,000 health care policy.

The specific details of the tax credit and policy cost mentioned in the claim are not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that Fox viewers are the most consistently misinformed media viewers is a generalization and lacks specific evidence or data to support it.

The claim is also subjective and could be influenced by political bias.

There is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in any election fixing or ethical misconduct during his time at Marquette.

"Explanation: The claim that only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island's sales tax is not accurate. In Rhode Island, sales tax is applied to most goods and services, with a few exceptions such as food, prescription drugs, and certain medical supplies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has indeed had a significant impact on reducing the number of uninsured individuals in Oregon. According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsured rate in Oregon decreased from 14.6% in 2013 to 7.5% in 2019. This represents a reduction of approximately 10 percentage points, which aligns with the claim.

However, the claim that Texas has installed more wind power than all but four countries is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require 100% of Americans to depend on federal payments or government benefits. The ACA aims to provide access to affordable health insurance for all Americans, but it does not eliminate private insurance or require everyone to rely on government benefits. Some people may still choose to purchase private insurance, and others may qualify for government assistance to help with their premiums or out-of-pocket costs. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresents the purpose and effects of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the sequester has already lost 1.6 million jobs is false. The sequester, which is a series of automatic spending cuts implemented in 2013, has been shown to have had a minimal impact on job growth. Studies by the Congressional Budget Office and other economic analysts have indicated that the sequester had a negligible effect on employment. The claim of 1.6 million jobs lost is not supported by credible economic data.

"Explanation: The claim is true. The construction of natural gas pipelines often involves extensive regulatory review processes due to environmental and safety concerns. In the United States, projects like this typically require approval from multiple federal agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and others. The review process can indeed take several months or even years, depending on the complexity of the project and the number of agencies involved.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad is not irrefutable in the context of social science. While some studies suggest that children raised by two parents may have certain advantages, such as better academic performance or emotional well-being, these findings are not universally applicable and are often influenced by various factors such as socioeconomic status, family dynamics, and individual differences. Moreover, the notion that children need both parents to thrive is not supported by all research, as many children raised by single parents or in other family structures also thrive and achieve success. Therefore, the claim is not irrefutable.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a quote often attributed to George Washington, but there is no evidence that he actually said these exact words. The quote is more commonly attributed to Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in a letter to William S. Smith in 1787: ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason for the people to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, for self-preservation against tyranny in government."" While the sentiment expressed in the claim is similar to Jefferson's words, it is not a direct quote from Washington.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no verified information indicating that Governor Chris Christie has embarked on a tour to demand that New Jersey's Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific study or data point that is not widely cited or verified. The 2008 recession had a significant impact on various sectors, and the recovery has been uneven. However, the claim that 60% of the jobs lost were living-wage jobs and only 40% of the jobs gained are living-wage jobs is not supported by widely accepted data or studies. The claim seems to be a generalization without specific sources or evidence.

"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010 and has significantly altered the healthcare landscape in the United States. It introduced several changes, including the expansion of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance marketplaces, and the requirement for most Americans to have health insurance. While the ACA has had a complex impact on the healthcare system, it has not fundamentally altered the doctor-patient relationship. The core of the relationship remains centered on the patient and their healthcare provider. The ACA has introduced new regulations and requirements, but it has not fundamentally changed the nature of the relationship between doctors and their patients.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Austin is indeed known for its thriving startup scene, with a significant number of venture capital investments and patent filings. According to various reports and rankings, Austin is often considered one of the top cities in Texas for startups and venture capital. However, it's important to note that the claim does not specify a particular metric or time frame, so it's difficult to definitively say that Austin is ""number one"" in Texas across all categories (startups, venture capital, and patents) at any given moment. Therefore, while the claim is largely true, it's not entirely accurate to say that Austin is ""number one"" in Texas in all these categories simultaneously.

Answer: 0.5 (The claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate.)"
"Explanation: The claim that stimulus money went to studying ants in Africa is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The ratio of workers to Social Security beneficiaries has been decreasing over time due to demographic changes and increased life expectancy.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's unemployment rate in 2015 was 5.7%, which was lower than the 6.4% rate in 2014. Additionally, the total number of people laid off in Wisconsin in 2015 was 6,685, which is indeed more than the 5,985 in 2014. However, the claim that Wisconsin's economy has ""tanked"" under Gov. Scott Walker is not supported by the data, as the unemployment rate and the number of layoffs were both lower in 2015 compared to 2014.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The BlackBerry was not created by John McCain. The BlackBerry was developed by Research in Motion (RIM), a Canadian company, and was first released in 1999.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""a lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government"" is false. The federal government does offer income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs, but these are not the same as refinancing. Refinancing typically involves a private lender taking over the loan, which is not a service provided by the federal government. The federal government does not refinance student loans in the traditional sense.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected, specifically $1.8 trillion, is false. The initial cost estimate for the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) was around $900 billion over 10 years, not $1.8 trillion. The $1.8 trillion figure is often cited in the context of the total cost of the healthcare system in the United States, not just the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While there are laws in various states that require independent investigations into deaths in police custody, there is no single governor who has signed such a law for the entire United States.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ron Johnson opposes entirely a federal minimum wage, except perhaps for guest workers, is a simplification and misrepresentation of his actual stance. Ron Johnson, a Republican Senator from Wisconsin, has expressed opposition to a federal minimum wage increase, arguing that it should be left to the states to decide. However, he has not explicitly stated that he opposes a federal minimum wage entirely, nor has he indicated that he supports it only for guest workers. The claim is false as it distorts his position.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""For the past year, I was censored and muzzled"" is subjective and cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence.

Without specific details or evidence, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The $6,000 figure is not based on any official or reliable source. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which provided tax cuts for the wealthy, did not result in a $6,000 annual cost for middle-class families. The actual impact of the tax cuts on middle-class families varies and is not as straightforward as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Texas leg of the Keystone pipeline has created 4,800 jobs in just the year it has been up and running is not accurate. The Keystone XL pipeline, which includes the Texas leg, was completed in November 2022, and it is not accurate to attribute 4,800 jobs to just the year it has been operational. The pipeline's construction phase created many jobs, but the operational phase does not typically create as many jobs. Additionally, the claim does not specify the source of the information, which is a red flag for credibility.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was a strong advocate for border security and supported the construction of a border fence. He was a co-sponsor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. Therefore, the claim that McCain opposed the border fence is false.

"Explanation: The claim that NATO has changed its policy to focus on terrorism threats is not accurate. NATO has indeed been involved in counter-terrorism efforts, but it has not created a new division specifically focused on terrorism threats. NATO's primary mission remains collective defense against external threats, and its counter-terrorism efforts are part of its broader mission. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of NATO's activities.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the percentage of births to unmarried mothers in the African-American community has been fluctuating but is not consistently at 68%. The most recent data from the CDC shows that the percentage of births to unmarried mothers in the African-American community is around 70%, but this figure is not static and varies over time. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that more children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry is not accurate. While agricultural work can be dangerous and children are often involved in these activities, especially in developing countries, the number of child deaths in agriculture is not higher than in other industries. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), child labor in agriculture is prevalent, but the number of child deaths in agriculture is not disproportionately higher compared to other sectors. The claim is misleading and not supported by reliable data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that rabid animals from other states carry different strains of rabies that Florida vaccines and serums don't affect is false. Rabies is caused by a virus that affects the nervous system and is transmitted through the bite of an infected animal. The virus does not mutate into different strains that are resistant to vaccines and serums. The rabies vaccine and serums used in Florida are effective against the rabies virus regardless of the state of origin of the infected animal. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirm that the rabies vaccine is effective against all strains of the virus.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is the largest tax increase in the history of the United States is not accurate. While the ACA did introduce several new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes are not the largest in U.S. history. For example, the Revenue Act of 1913, which established the modern income tax system, and the Revenue Act of 1940, which introduced the payroll tax, were larger tax increases. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a study ranked Florida No. 1 in government corruption under Gov. Rick Scott is false.

Instead, it introduced a new system that allows for more flexibility in evaluating and removing teachers who are not performing well.

Therefore, it's not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

"Explanation: The claim that an annual income of $500,000 in Manhattan is considered middle class is false. In Manhattan, the median household income is around $100,000, and the average household income is around $150,000.

Obama's stance on the debt ceiling and his criticism of President Bush's economic policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) did not find that the stimulus bill would lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2019.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Hosni Mubarak were all authoritarian leaders who suppressed independent unions, the claim that they ""didn't want unions"" is an oversimplification. Hitler, for instance, initially supported the German Labor Front (DAF) as a means to control the German workforce, but later suppressed it. Stalin also initially supported unions but later suppressed them as part of his broader campaign to control all aspects of society. Mubarak, similarly, initially allowed some unions but later suppressed them as part of his authoritarian rule. Therefore, the claim that they ""didn't want unions"" is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"

The claim is a misrepresentation of the ACA's provisions.

However, the claim suggests that no Democrat has been elected since before ""The Wizard of Oz"" hit the movie theaters in 1939, which is not accurate.

While it is true that Bain Capital, under Romney's leadership, closed several plants, including the one where the woman's husband worked, it is not accurate to attribute the woman's death directly to this closure. The claim lacks specific evidence linking the plant closure to the woman's death and does not consider other potential contributing factors to her health condition. Therefore, the claim is not supported by sufficient evidence.

"Explanation: The 2013 immigration bill, also known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did not specifically address Syrian refugees or their resettlement. The bill focused on border security, legalization of undocumented immigrants, and other immigration-related issues. The resettlement of Syrian refugees was a separate issue that began to gain attention after the Syrian civil war escalated in 2011. The U.S. government's ability to bring Syrian refugees to the country was governed by the Refugee Act of 1980, which established the process for admitting refugees, including background checks. Therefore, the claim that the 2013 immigration bill expanded President Obama's ability to bring Syrian refugees without mandating meaningful background checks is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The $2 billion spent on alternative energy as part of the stimulus package did not exclusively go to purchase wind turbines built in China. The claim misrepresents the allocation of funds and the source of the wind turbines. The stimulus package was designed to promote domestic renewable energy projects, and while some components may have been sourced from abroad, the majority of the funds were intended to support American jobs and industries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts is not accurate. While federal employees often have higher salaries than private sector employees, the difference is not typically twice as much. According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, federal employees earn about 17% more than private sector employees, not twice as much.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of the latest data available, Latinos do not make up the majority population in Texas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2020, the largest ethnic group in Texas is White (42.4%), followed by Hispanic or Latino (39.8%), and then Black or African American (12.8%). Therefore, the claim that Latinos now make up the majority population in Texas is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker did propose a law that would provide a two-year tax exemption for businesses that move into the state, but this law was not passed. The proposed law was part of a broader economic development package, but it did not become law. Therefore, businesses moving into Wisconsin would not be exempt from paying taxes on their income for two years.

"Explanation: The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is a complex set of laws and regulations that govern the tax system in the United States. It is estimated to be around 70,000 pages long. The Bible, on the other hand, is a religious text that is approximately 780,000 words long. Therefore, the claim that there are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Most voters prefer zombies to the current U.S. Congress"" is not based on any credible polling data or scientific research. It is a hyperbolic and humorous statement that does not reflect the actual preferences of voters. The statement is likely intended to be a joke or a commentary on the public's dissatisfaction with the current political climate, rather than a factual claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the wealthiest counties in the United States are not concentrated in and around the Washington, D.C. area. The top 10 wealthiest counties by median income are spread across various states, including California, New York, and Texas. For example, the wealthiest county in the U.S. is Loudoun County, Virginia, which is near Washington, D.C., but the other top counties are not in the same area.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not promise to cut the deficit by half by the end of his first term. Instead, he promised to reduce the deficit by half over the next decade.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama carried Congressional District 13 by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012 is false. The 2008 election results for Congressional District 13 show that Obama won by a margin of 10.5 points, not 8.2. In 2012, he won by a margin of 11.3 points, not 5.6. These figures can be verified through official election results from the Federal Election Commission or other reputable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""We are not producing jobs"" contradicts the claim that ""We created 80,000 jobs last month."" If the government or company in question created 80,000 jobs, then they are indeed producing jobs. The claim also implies that the net job creation is negative, which is not supported by the statement that 80,000 jobs were created.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend"" is a misinterpretation of the national debt. The national debt refers to the total amount of money that the U.S. government owes to its creditors. When the government spends more money than it collects in taxes, it borrows money to cover the difference. However, this does not mean that every dollar spent is borrowed. The claim is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the promise Delta Air Lines made to the person or the people of Memphis. Without concrete information, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, it cannot be determined if Delta Air Lines has indeed broken a promise.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The wealthiest counties in the United States are typically measured by median household income, not by the number of counties in a specific area. The Washington, D.C., area is indeed home to some of the wealthiest counties in the country, but it is not accurate to say that seven of the top ten wealthiest counties are in this area. The top ten wealthiest counties in the U.S. are often found in states like California, New York, and Texas, and the specific counties can vary depending on the source and the year of the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Refugees undergo a more rigorous screening process than the average tourist in the U.S. This is due to the fact that refugees are subject to a more extensive vetting process, including interviews, background checks, and security screenings, to ensure they do not pose a threat to national security. In contrast, tourists typically only need to provide basic information and may not undergo the same level of scrutiny.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: While water transportation is indeed one of the most fuel-efficient and least polluting means of moving cargo, it is not necessarily the safest or least expensive. Safety can vary depending on the type of waterway and the specific conditions of the voyage. Additionally, water transportation can be expensive due to factors such as port fees, vessel maintenance, and the need for specialized equipment. Therefore, the claim that water transportation is the ""safest"" and ""least expensive"" is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is false. According to the Oregon Secretary of State's website, the voter turnout for the 2008 general election in Oregon was approximately 75.5%. Therefore, the claim that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""about 7 in 10 of Oregon's inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses."" To verify this, I would need to check the latest statistics from a reliable source such as the Oregon Department of Corrections or the Bureau of Justice Statistics. However, based on general trends and available data, it is known that a significant portion of inmates in the United States are incarcerated for violent crimes and serious sex offenses. Without specific data for Oregon, it is difficult to confirm the exact percentage, but it is plausible that a substantial number of inmates in Oregon fall into these categories.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Harry Reid, who served as the Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2015, was known to have a contentious relationship with John McCain, but he did not publicly express his dislike for McCain in the way described in the claim. The quote attributed to Reid is not accurate.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or fabrication of his policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Fair Tax will be like waving a magic wand releasing us from pain and unfairness is hyperbolic and misleading. The Fair Tax, also known as the FairTax Act, is a proposed tax reform that would replace the current income tax system with a national sales tax. While proponents argue that it could simplify the tax code and reduce the tax burden on lower-income individuals, it also has significant drawbacks, such as potentially increasing the tax burden on lower-income individuals due to the regressive nature of a sales tax, and it does not address all forms of economic inequality or unfairness. Therefore, the claim that it will release us from all pain and unfairness is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Governor Carcieri has not been campaigning with the speaker. Without specific context or evidence, it is difficult to verify the truth of this claim. However, if the speaker is a political figure and the claim is made in a public or official setting, it could be considered true if there is no evidence to the contrary.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago. This claim is false because it is not typical for a legislator to oppose a vote on their own legislation. If a legislator introduces a bill, they typically support it and advocate for its passage. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the legislative process.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Crist sent his 'top policy staffer to the House Committee to testify in support of the proposal,' then vetoed the bill"" implies that Crist initially supported the proposal but later changed his mind. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Crist's top policy staffer testified in support of the proposal, nor is there any indication that he later vetoed the bill. Therefore, the claim is not supported by facts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, the average annual expenditure on health care for a family was approximately $4,000. This figure is significantly lower than the $13,000 claimed in the statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""I supported the surge when you didn't"" is vague and lacks specific context.

According to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as of 2021, approximately 41.5 million Americans were receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which is the program commonly referred to as food stamps. The claim is exaggerated by 1.5 million.

"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual, Buono, and their voting record on tax-related issues. To verify this claim, I would need to check the voting records of the individual in question.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific time period and percentage increases/decreases in the number of EPA employees and total federal personnel. To verify this claim, one would need to check the historical data for the EPA and total federal personnel from 1972 to 2011. However, without access to this specific data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Senate Finance Committee bill, which is a legislative document, does not have a ""report"" by the health insurance industry. The bill is a legislative proposal, and any analysis or critique of it would come from various sources, including news outlets, think tanks, or advocacy groups, but not from the health insurance industry itself.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: In the United States, the practice of checking the immigration status of individuals during routine traffic stops or other arrests is a contentious issue. While some states have laws that allow police officers to check immigration status, others have laws that prohibit such checks. The specific rights of police officers in this regard can vary significantly depending on the state and the context of the arrest. Therefore, the claim that ""Police officers in this state have that right, to check the immigration status of people they arrest"" is not universally true and depends on the specific state and its laws.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold voted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants is false.

"Explanation: The claim that 25% of kids in foster care are there because their parents are involved in drugs is not accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the most common reasons for children entering foster care are neglect (50.9%), parental substance abuse (28.5%), and physical abuse (10.7%). The claim overstates the percentage of children in foster care due to parental drug involvement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible source or data to support the statement that over 81 percent of babies born at LBJ Hospital in Houston are born to women who are not here legally.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Donna Shalala, who served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton, did not leave anyone with 12 million doses of smallpox vaccine. Additionally, the claim that the person created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man, woman, and child in America is not supported by any credible sources. The U.S. government has been working on smallpox vaccine distribution and production, but there is no evidence to support the claim that an individual created enough vaccine to vaccinate the entire population.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama shut down NASA space flights and turned the agency into a Muslim outreach department is false. During his presidency, NASA continued its space missions, including the International Space Station and the Mars rovers. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the claim that NASA was turned into a Muslim outreach department. This claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the compromise tax agreement. The agreement does not mean that 99.7% of American families will not pay any estate tax. Instead, it means that the estate tax exemption is increased, so only the wealthiest estates will be subject to the tax. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that millennials are more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans is not accurate. According to various polls and surveys, millennials tend to be more liberal on social issues, including abortion. A 2019 Gallup poll found that 58% of millennials (born 1981-1996) support legal abortion, compared to 51% of baby boomers (born 1946-1964) and 53% of Generation X (born 1965-1980).

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or policy from former President Barack Obama that specifically targets individuals who have investments for their child's education, own mutual funds, or have stocks in a retirement plan. Tax policies are typically broader and do not target specific investment types or individuals based on their personal financial circumstances.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is generally true. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls were relatively flat from 2007 to 2021, with some fluctuations but no significant upward trend. On the other hand, corporate profits have been increasing, and CEO pay has also been rising. This discrepancy is often highlighted in discussions about income inequality.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that personal income is growing faster in Tennessee on average than any other state in the country is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal income growth rates vary by state, and Tennessee's growth rate is not consistently the highest among all states. While Tennessee may have experienced significant growth in certain periods, it is not accurate to say that it is growing faster than every other state on average.

"Explanation: The claim that the Army is spending $7 million to sponsor a NASCAR team is false.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Obama voted to support President Bush between 40 and 50 percent of the time over the past two years is false. Barack Obama served as the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017, and George W. Bush was the President from 2001 to 2009. Therefore, there was no overlap in their presidencies, and Obama did not vote to support Bush during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Democratic proposal for a government-controlled health care plan, often referred to as Medicare for All, does not aim to deprive Americans of their current health care coverage. Instead, it seeks to expand access to health care by providing a public option that would compete with private insurance plans. The proposal does not target or aim to eliminate existing private health insurance plans. The claim of depriving 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage is a misrepresentation of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is responsible for the roughly $7,800 in property taxes per year is false. Property taxes are levied by local governments, including cities, counties, and school districts, to fund public services. The mayor of a city has some influence over the budget and tax rates, but they are not directly responsible for the amount of property taxes an individual pays. The tax rate and the amount of property taxes paid are determined by the city council and other local governing bodies, not the mayor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is not identified as Houston's mayor. Without specific information about who made the claim and their role in Houston's job growth, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

The neighbors of the shooters did not report any such plans to the authorities.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Texas Supreme Court's website, the majority of justices have prior judicial experience. As of 2021, out of the 150 justices who have served on the Texas Supreme Court, only a small fraction had no prior judicial experience. The claim exaggerates the number of justices with no prior experience.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the incidents of threats against President Barack Obama are greater than for any other president in modern times is not accurate. While President Obama did face several threats and assassination attempts during his presidency, the number of threats he faced is not unprecedented compared to other modern presidents. For instance, President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt, and President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Therefore, the claim that Obama faced more threats than any other modern president is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific proposal by President Obama in 2011, which was a spending freeze for non-defense discretionary spending. This freeze was intended to reduce the growth of the federal budget, but it did not affect the overall spending levels for the period from 2011 to 2020. The claim that the spending freeze would only reduce the $42 trillion in government spending by little more than one-half of 1 percent is accurate because the spending freeze was a temporary measure that did not significantly impact the overall spending trend over the decade.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day is highly unlikely. The process of creating and implementing new laws typically involves a lengthy process that includes legislative proposals, committee reviews, debates, and approvals. It is not feasible for 40,000 new laws to be enacted in a single day. This claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinformation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: At the beginning of World War II, the United Kingdom had a significantly larger army than Portugal. The UK had a standing army of around 200,000 troops, while Portugal had a much smaller army, with estimates ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 troops. Therefore, the claim that the UK had a relatively small army, smaller than Portugal's, is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""Were within 600 miles of 60 percent of America."" This is a geographical claim that can be evaluated by looking at the population distribution and the distances involved. The United States has a population of approximately 331 million people. If we consider 60 percent of the population, that would be around 200 million people. If we assume a uniform distribution, 600 miles would cover a significant portion of the country, but it's not accurate to say that 60 percent of the population is within 600 miles of a specific location. The claim is vague and does not provide specific data or context to support the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about state budget cuts resulting in nearly 4,000 educator layoffs is not verifiable with the information provided.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific gun bill before the Senate that is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the U.S. added 431,000 jobs in February 2021, making it the top job creator for that month. However, the claim that the U.S. is now the No. 4 job creator in the last year is incorrect.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim ""This is a test of the fact-checking widget"" is a statement about the purpose of the current interaction, which is to test the functionality of a fact-checking widget. Since the purpose of the statement is to inform about the test, it is not a claim about a factual event or statement that can be verified as true or false. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a true or false claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets and resulted in a decrease in murder and violent crime rates for eight consecutive years is misleading. The bill in question is the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, not Joe Biden. The act did not add 100,000 cops but rather provided funding for local law enforcement agencies. Additionally, while there was a decrease in violent crime rates in the 1990s, it is not accurate to attribute this solely to the Biden Crime Bill. Multiple factors, including changes in policing strategies, demographic shifts, and economic conditions, contributed to the decline in crime rates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA) did make some changes to Medicare, it did not cut Medicare benefits for seniors. The ACA actually expanded Medicare benefits for seniors by providing preventive care services without cost-sharing and closing the Medicare Part D ""doughnut hole."" The claim that only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors is incorrect because other presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, have made changes to Medicare that could be seen as cuts or reductions in benefits.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that having a baby is a leading cause of poverty in the United States is not accurate. While it is true that having children can increase the financial burden on a family, it is not the leading cause of poverty. Poverty in the United States is primarily driven by factors such as lack of education, unemployment, underemployment, and systemic issues like racial and gender-based wage gaps, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate social safety nets. Having a baby can exacerbate existing financial struggles, but it is not the primary cause of poverty.

"Explanation: The claim that you have to get a license to fish on our beaches is generally false. In many places, including the United States, you do not need a license to fish from the shore. However, there are some exceptions and regulations that may apply, such as size limits, daily bag limits, and specific gear restrictions. It's always a good idea to check local regulations or contact a local fishing authority for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island voters are moving away from the Democratic party to non-affiliation is based on a trend observed in recent elections. According to the latest data from the Rhode Island Secretary of State's office, there has been a significant increase in the number of unaffiliated voters in the state. This trend suggests that a portion of voters who previously identified as Democrats are now choosing to register as unaffiliated. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that all Democrats are leaving the party; rather, it indicates a shift in voter registration patterns.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of elections and the number of incumbents defeated can vary greatly depending on the specific states and years in question. The claim does not provide specific details about the states or years involved, making it impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim that only three incumbents have been defeated in 420 elections is highly unlikely and suggests a lack of understanding of the typical outcomes of state legislative elections.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama doubled the deficit is misleading. While it is true that the U.S. federal deficit increased significantly during Obama's presidency, it is not accurate to say that he doubled it. The deficit increased from $1.08 trillion in 2008 to $1.4 trillion in 2012, which is an increase of about 30%, not a doubling. Additionally, the deficit was largely driven by the economic crisis and the subsequent stimulus packages, not solely by Obama's policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that John McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan is false. John McCain, a Republican, was a strong advocate for a surge of troops in Afghanistan during his time as a senator and was critical of President Obama's withdrawal strategy. There is no evidence to suggest that McCain has changed his position on this issue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that most serial killers and people who commit domestic violence start off by abusing animals is not supported by empirical evidence. While there are some cases where individuals who abuse animals also go on to commit other forms of violence, this is not a universal pattern. The correlation between animal abuse and other forms of violence is not strong enough to make the claim that ""most"" of these individuals start off by abusing animals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland supported giving $150 billion to the Iranian regime is false. Ted Strickland, a former governor of Ohio, has not been involved in any policy decisions regarding the Iranian regime or any financial support for it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) is a proposed law that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The claim that the DREAM Act would grant lower tuition to undocumented immigrants is a misinterpretation of the act. The DREAM Act does not specifically address tuition rates, and it does not provide lower tuition rates to undocumented immigrants. The claim is a distortion of the facts surrounding the DREAM Act.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican-authored state budget in question does not include a provision forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance. The claim is a misinterpretation of the budget's provisions, which primarily focus on expanding access to health insurance through the marketplace and potentially increasing the number of people eligible for subsidies.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While there has been significant construction of new oil and gas pipelines in recent years, the claim that the total length of these pipelines is enough to circle the Earth and then some is an exaggeration. The Earth's circumference is approximately 40,075 kilometers (24,901 miles). The total length of new pipelines constructed in the past three years is not enough to exceed this distance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and its benchmarks. The GAO is a federal agency that provides independent, objective analysis to Congress and the public. The claim states that three out of 18 benchmarks have been fulfilled, which implies a failure. However, the claim does not provide specific details about which benchmarks were fulfilled or what the criteria for success are. Without specific details, it is difficult to verify the claim's accuracy. Additionally, the claim mentions ""Republican math,"" which suggests a political bias, but this does not affect the factuality of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. President Barack Obama did indeed make statements about ISIS (or ISIL) being contained, specifically in the context of its geographic expansion in Iraq and Syria. For instance, in a 2015 press conference, he stated, ""We have contained ISIL's expansion in Iraq and Syria."" This statement was made in response to the situation on the ground at that time, indicating that the containment was a specific response to the geographic spread of ISIS in those regions.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""earmarks have come down significantly, 75 percent."" However, without specific context or data to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Earmarks are typically government funds allocated for specific projects or programs, and their reduction could be due to various reasons such as budget cuts, policy changes, or shifts in government priorities. To accurately evaluate this claim, one would need to refer to official government reports, budget documents, or other reliable sources that provide specific data on the reduction of earmarks.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 2010 was the worst year ever for America's doctors reimbursed by Medicare is not accurate. While 2010 did see a significant reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates, it was not the worst year ever. In fact, the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, which was used to determine reimbursement rates, led to a 21.4% reduction in 2010. However, this was not the largest reduction in history. The largest reduction occurred in 2003, when the SGR formula led to a 4.4% reduction. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""regulations have quadrupled"" under a specific president is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are advisers within Obama's campaign who are anti-Israel. While it is true that some individuals associated with Obama's campaign have expressed views critical of Israeli policies, it is not accurate to label them as ""anti-Israel"" in a blanket statement. The claim is an oversimplification and lacks nuance. It is important to note that political views are complex and cannot be reduced to a single label.

"Explanation: The claim is true. During the Great Recession of 2008, corporate profits indeed declined significantly. However, by 2010, two years after the recession, corporate profits began to recover and eventually surpassed pre-recession levels. This recovery was driven by various factors, including increased productivity, cost-cutting measures, and a recovering economy.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The president did not propose eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers.

"Explanation: Mitt Romney has been the subject of numerous claims about his financial dealings, including allegations of having millions in the Cayman Islands.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""There is already a mosque four blocks away"" cannot be verified without specific context or additional information.

"Explanation: The claim that 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay is not accurate.

According to various studies and reports, the number of people who rely on eBay for their primary income is in the tens of thousands, not millions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Northern Virginia is the most heavily trafficked place in the country is not accurate. While Northern Virginia, particularly the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, does experience heavy traffic due to its proximity to the nation's capital and major highways, it is not the most heavily trafficked place in the country. That distinction typically goes to areas with high population densities and major transportation hubs, such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan's proposal, known as the ""Ryan Budget,"" did not limit Medicare spending to $15,000 per person. Instead, it proposed converting Medicare into a premium support system, where beneficiaries would receive a fixed amount of money to purchase private health insurance plans. The $15,000 figure is a misinterpretation of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about 25 million to 30 million people being allowed to access a national health insurance exchange is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been in effect since 2014 and has provided health insurance to millions of Americans through the Health Insurance Marketplace. However, the claim of a specific number of people being allowed to access the exchange is not accurate and does not reflect the reality of the ACA's implementation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Oregon has had unemployment higher than the national average for 17 years. To verify this, I would need to check historical unemployment data for Oregon and the United States. However, without specific data points, it's challenging to confirm the claim. Typically, unemployment rates fluctuate over time, and it's possible for a state to have higher unemployment than the national average for extended periods. Therefore, without concrete data, it's difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

"Explanation: The claim that Rick Scott has teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist is a complex one. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified evidence to support this specific claim. The claim is not substantiated by credible news sources or official records. Therefore, it is likely to be a false or unfounded claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""there is not one Democrat who endorses the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan"" is false. While it is true that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan, which proposed to replace Medicare with a voucher system, was not widely endorsed by Democrats, there were some Democrats who expressed support for certain aspects of the plan or were open to negotiations. For instance, some Democrats, such as Senator Joe Lieberman, were open to discussing a voucher system as part of a broader healthcare reform package. Therefore, the claim that ""there is not one Democrat who endorses the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan"" is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States death rate is two-and-a-half times higher for those who do not have a high school education is based on a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

This indicates that the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about a specific area (McAllen) and its constituents.

Without specific data or a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Switzerland and the Netherlands cover all their citizens using private insurers and do so for much less cost is misleading. Both countries have universal healthcare systems, but they differ in their approach to funding and delivery. In Switzerland, the healthcare system is primarily funded through a mix of public and private insurance, with the government setting minimum coverage requirements. The Netherlands also has a universal healthcare system, but it is funded through a combination of public and private insurance, with the government regulating the market to ensure affordability and accessibility. While these systems may have lower costs compared to some other countries, they are not entirely private insurers covering all citizens.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ExxonMobil made $19 billion in profit last year and paid zero in taxes, receiving a $156 million refund from the IRS, is false. While it is true that ExxonMobil has reported significant profits, the claim about paying zero taxes and receiving a refund is misleading. Corporations can receive tax refunds if they overpay their taxes, but this does not mean they paid zero in taxes. The claim is likely an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the company's tax situation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is acting without consultation or input from the company to stop the sale of Buckyballs. However, the CPSC typically follows a process that includes consultation with manufacturers and other stakeholders before taking regulatory actions. The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that the CPSC is acting without consultation. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Many states in the United States have been cutting back on funding for public television.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the United States has one of the highest vaccination rates among developed countries. However, some African countries have also achieved high vaccination rates, particularly in the context of COVID-19. For example, countries like Rwanda and Seychelles have had high vaccination rates due to their effective public health strategies and international support. Therefore, while it is true that some African countries have higher vaccination rates than others, it is not accurate to say that all African countries have higher rates than the United States.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On support for the Bridge to Nowhere"" is ambiguous and does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. The term ""Bridge to Nowhere"" is often used to describe a project that is not needed or is a waste of resources, but without additional context, it's impossible to say whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""For decades, the states gas tax has been among the highest in the nation"" is not accurate. While some states do have high gas taxes, it is not accurate to say that this has been the case for decades. Gas tax rates vary by state and can change over time. For example, in 2021, California had the highest gas tax rate in the nation, but other states have had higher rates in the past. Therefore, the claim is not true.

"Explanation: The claim that small businesses are going out of business in record numbers is not accurate. While it is true that many small businesses have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall trend is not as severe as the claim suggests. According to various reports and studies, while there has been an increase in business closures, the rate is not unprecedented and is not at record levels. The Small Business Administration (SBA) and other sources have reported that while many businesses have closed, the overall number of closures is not at an all-time high.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The weight of turkeys has indeed increased over time due to selective breeding and improved feeding practices. However, the specific weights provided in the claim are not accurate. According to the National Turkey Federation, the average weight of a turkey in the United States in 2020 was around 16 pounds, which is significantly higher than the 13.2 pounds claimed for the 1930s. The 29.8 pounds claimed for today's turkeys is also not accurate, as the average weight of a turkey in 2020 was around 16 pounds.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The $60 billion approved by Congress in response to Hurricane Sandy was not solely for disaster relief.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The President has indeed taken executive actions on immigration, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for certain countries.

The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the President's statements and actions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is generally true. The U.S. tax system is progressive, meaning that higher-income individuals typically pay a higher effective tax rate than lower-income individuals. The top 1% of earners in the U.S. often pay an effective tax rate of around 20-30%, while the middle class, which typically falls into the 15% and 25% income tax brackets, also faces payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes) that can add up to around 7.65% of their income. Therefore, the claim that the mega-rich pay about 15 percent in taxes while the middle class is hit with heavy payroll taxes is accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's estimate of a $3.6 billion state budget deficit is manufactured and a bogus figure is false. The Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, an independent state agency, has confirmed that the state faces a budget deficit of $3.6 billion for the 2021-2023 biennium. This figure is based on the state's revenue projections and spending plans, and it is not a manufactured or bogus figure.

"Explanation: The claim that children born today will carry a $30,000 share of the national debt is false. The national debt is a collective responsibility of the country, and it is not accurately divided among individuals based on their birth year.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are both regulatory agencies in the United States, but they have different jurisdictions. The USDA primarily regulates meat, poultry, and egg products, while the FDA regulates most other foods, including sandwiches. The number of slices of bread in a sandwich does not change the regulatory agency responsible for it. Both a sandwich on one slice of bread and a sandwich on two slices of bread would fall under the FDA's jurisdiction.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Among Syrian refugees, there aren't that many women, there aren't that many children"" is false. According to various reports and studies, the Syrian refugee population is composed of a significant number of women and children.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Buffett Rule, proposed by Warren Buffett, is a tax policy that would impose a minimum tax rate on individuals with very high incomes. The claim that the Buffett Rule would bring in less than $5 billion per year is false. The Buffett Rule is designed to ensure that high-income individuals pay a minimum tax rate, and estimates suggest that it could generate significant revenue. For example, a 2012 analysis by the Congressional Research Service estimated that the Buffett Rule could generate around $50 billion in revenue annually. Therefore, the claim that it would bring in less than $5 billion per year is inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim that one-third of the healthcare dollar goes to insurance companies is a misinterpretation of the actual distribution of healthcare costs. The claim is often used to argue against the high cost of healthcare insurance, but it is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in 2019, about 34% of healthcare spending was for private health insurance, not one-third. The remaining 66% was for Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs, as well as out-of-pocket spending by patients. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The largest six financial institutions in the United States do not have assets that are equivalent to 60 percent of the GDP of the United States. According to the Federal Reserve, the total assets of the six largest U.S. banks (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) were approximately $12.5 trillion in 2021. The GDP of the United States in 2021 was around $22.9 trillion. Therefore, the assets of these six banks are approximately 55% of the GDP, not 60%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that bus riders are subsidizing the Leander-to-Austin train, implying that the train's costs are being covered by bus riders. However, this is not accurate. The Leander-to-Austin train is a separate service with its own funding sources, typically including fares, government subsidies, and potentially other funding mechanisms. Bus riders do not subsidize the train; they pay for their own bus services. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: Drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and in parts of Alaska can indeed increase domestic oil production, which can help reduce dependence on foreign oil. However, it's important to note that this process takes time. Oil exploration and production can take several years from discovery to actual production. Additionally, the claim that it will ""immediately"" reduce dependence is an oversimplification. While increased domestic production can help, it's not a quick fix. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support the claim that a lawyer demanded several Houston pastors hand over their private papers, including their sermons.

"Explanation: The claim that ""our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years"" is a statement that needs to be evaluated based on specific economic data.

"Explanation: Bernie Sanders has indeed faced negative ads during his political career. For instance, during his 2016 presidential campaign, he was the target of several negative ads, particularly from the Republican Party and super PACs.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The individuals mentioned in the claim (Attorney General McCollum, Speaker-Designate Cannon, and Senate President-Designate Haridopolos) were not involved in the removal of Jim Greer as Chairman of the Florida Republican Party.

While Phoenix, Arizona, has seen an increase in kidnappings in recent years, it is not accurate to label it as one of the ""kidnapping capitals of the world.""

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25 per hour, not $7.75. The poverty level for a single person in 2021 was $12,880 per year, or $107.33 per month. At a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, a full-time worker would earn $15,080 per year, which is above the poverty level.

"Explanation: The claim that students who receive free or reduced lunch are performing just as well as students who do not is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some students receiving free or reduced lunch may perform well, research has shown that there is often a correlation between socioeconomic status and academic achievement.

As of my last update in October 2023, Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson are not prominent figures in the current political landscape, and their views on the marriage amendment are not widely known or reported.

"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) will cause up to 20 million Americans to lose the insurance they currently have and want to keep is misleading. While it's true that some people may lose their insurance due to changes in eligibility or affordability, the overall impact is more nuanced. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage, not to reduce it. Many people who were previously uninsured or had inadequate coverage have gained access to better insurance options through the ACA. The claim of 20 million people losing insurance is often cited in the context of the individual mandate and the potential for increased premiums, but it's important to note that these changes were intended to balance the system and ensure that everyone had access to affordable healthcare.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 90 percent of job growth since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed has been in full-time positions is not accurate.

Decisions about medical treatment are made by healthcare providers, not bureaucrats.

Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has lifted the embargo and allowed travel to Cuba is incorrect.

"Explanation: During Mitt Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, the state's budget did indeed decrease in size. However, it's important to note that this was primarily due to a decrease in spending on social services and education, rather than a broad-based reduction in government size. Additionally, the state's budget was also influenced by federal stimulus funds during the recession. Therefore, while there was a reduction in government spending, it is not accurate to say that the rate of growth of the government was slowed or that it was cut overall.

"Explanation: The claim states that both women and men are making less when adjusted for inflation compared to when John Kitzhaber was first elected governor. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical data on wages and inflation rates. However, without specific data points or a clear reference to the time period in question, it is challenging to verify the claim. Typically, wage adjustments for inflation are calculated using indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Austin has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded is not accurate. While Austin has experienced significant growth over the years, the rate of doubling every 25 years is an exaggeration. Austin's population growth has been steady but not exponential. For instance, in the 1970s, Austin's population was around 300,000, and by the 2000s, it had grown to around 700,000, which is a significant increase but not a doubling every 25 years.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the New York State Governor Kathy Hochul in a press release. According to the press release, New York State added 800,000 private sector jobs in 2021, which is a significant increase. The unemployment rate in New York State has been decreasing, and as of the latest data, it is indeed lower than it was before the pandemic. However, the claim that New York State has more private sector jobs than it has ever had in its history is not explicitly stated in the press release. The press release only mentions that the state added 800,000 jobs in 2021, which is a record for the state, but it does not compare this to all-time historical data.

Answer: 1"

"Explanation: Sen. Barack Obama, who later became President Obama, has indeed been consistently rated as pro-choice by organizations such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. However, the claim that he has always had a ""100 percent pro-choice rating"" is a simplification. While he has consistently supported abortion rights, his stance has evolved over time, and he has not always been in favor of all aspects of abortion rights. For example, he has supported restrictions on late-term abortions. Therefore, the claim that he has always had a ""100 percent pro-choice rating"" is not entirely accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that ""half our general revenue goes to education"" is not accurate. The percentage of general revenue allocated to education varies by country and can be influenced by various factors such as the specific government's budget priorities, economic conditions, and the overall tax revenue. For example, in the United States, education spending is a significant portion of the federal budget, but it is not exactly half. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in 2020, the federal government spent about 10% of its budget on education, while state and local governments spent a larger portion. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

In the 1985 election, Tom Kean defeated Jim Florio with a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%, which was indeed a significant margin. However, the claim that this was the largest margin in Jersey history is incorrect. In 1993, Jim Florio defeated Christine Todd Whitman with a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%, which is the same margin as Tom Kean's victory in 1985. Therefore, neither of these elections had the largest margin in Jersey history.

Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has faced numerous legal challenges, but the claim that twelve judges have thrown out legal challenges because they rejected the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional is inaccurate.

Therefore, the claim that kindergartners are being taught about gay marriage is inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that Congress is ""bewildered at the scope and reach of our spying apparatus"" is not supported by any credible sources. Additionally, the claim that Congress explicitly rejected an amendment calling for more disclosure in 2008 and 2012 is also incorrect. There were indeed discussions and amendments related to surveillance practices, but the claim that Congress explicitly rejected them is misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by Donald Trump during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton ""starts off with 47 percent of the country against her."" This statement was widely criticized as misleading and inaccurate. Polls and surveys conducted during the campaign showed that Clinton had significant support from a majority of the American public. Therefore, the claim that she starts off with 47 percent of the country against her is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Rand Paul has put out budgets to cut the military in half is false. Sen. Paul has indeed proposed cuts to the military budget, but he has not proposed cutting it in half. His proposals have been more modest, such as reducing the military budget by a certain percentage or redirecting funds to other areas. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Texas is spending $500 less per student due to legislative cuts is not accurate. While there have been discussions about budget cuts and potential reductions in education spending, the actual amount of reduction per student varies and is not universally $500.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!"" is a statement that typically requires specific data or evidence to verify its truthfulness. Without concrete numbers or evidence to support the claim, it is impossible to determine if the fundraising numbers are indeed in and if the grassroots support is unmatched. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the average federal worker makes twice as much as the average private sector worker is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2021, the median annual wage for federal employees was $85,000, while the median annual wage for all workers in the private sector was $41,500. This means that the median federal worker earns about 1.08 times the median private sector worker, not twice as much.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) is a panel of 15 experts that provides recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on Medicare payment policies. However, the IPAB does not make all major healthcare decisions for over 300 million Americans. Its role is advisory, and its recommendations are not binding. The final decisions are made by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Congress.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that no three consecutive presidents have been re-elected before the last three presidents is incorrect. In fact, there have been several instances of consecutive re-elections in U.S. history. For example, Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms (1885-1889 and 1893-1897), and William Howard Taft and Calvin Coolidge both served as vice presidents and then became president, with Coolidge succeeding Taft. Additionally, Franklin D. Roosevelt was re-elected for four consecutive terms (1932-1944), which is the most consecutive terms any president has served.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a projection from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) which estimated that the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 would cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years. This is indeed higher than the $940 billion originally claimed by Democrats for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2009. However, the claim does not specify which healthcare overhaul is being referred to, which could lead to confusion. The claim is technically true but could be misleading if the context is not clear.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme is false. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading. Social Security, on the other hand, is a government-run program that collects taxes from workers and uses those funds to pay benefits to retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased workers. The program is funded through payroll taxes and is not dependent on new investors to generate returns for existing participants.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history is false. While President Trump did propose tax increases during his presidency, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced corporate and individual tax rates, he did not propose the largest tax increase in American history. The largest tax increase in American history was implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, which increased the top marginal income tax rate to 79%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget is false. Earmarks, which are provisions in legislation that direct funds to specific projects or programs, have been significantly reduced in recent years. In 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 eliminated earmarks for the federal budget, and the amount of money allocated through earmarks has been declining since then. Therefore, the claim that earmarks account for $18-billion of our budget is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is subjective and depends on the specific context and comparison. To accurately judge the claim, one would need to compare tolls across different bridges in the nation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that John McCain ""hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign"" is false. While McCain did have a team of experienced political operatives and advisors, there is no evidence to suggest that he specifically hired ""some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington"" to run his campaign. The claim is an exaggeration and not supported by factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. John was indeed a raging populist when he ran for president four years ago. His campaign was characterized by strong anti-establishment rhetoric, promises to ""drain the swamp,"" and a focus on issues that resonated with disaffected voters. His policies and statements during his campaign were widely considered populist in nature.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. House Republicans did not complain about not having enough time to consider a constitutional ban against oil drilling. Instead, they were pushing for a proposal to open state waters to oil drilling. The claim inaccurately suggests that they were complaining about the lack of time to consider a ban, which is not supported by the actual events.

"Explanation: The claim is false. George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, attended the 2008 Republican National Convention as a former president. Additionally, Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida and a member of the Bush family, attended the 2012 Republican National Convention as a potential presidential candidate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Texas Republicans believe in abolishing Social Security and V.A. health care is a misrepresentation. While there are some Republicans who have proposed changes to these programs, such as raising the retirement age for Social Security or reducing benefits, there is no widespread or official Republican stance in Texas or nationally that advocates for the complete abolition of these programs. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Bush administration did not write a check to General Motors without any conditions of change. In fact, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) provided funds to General Motors and Chrysler in 2008, but these funds came with conditions, including the requirement for the companies to restructure and reduce their debt. The government also received equity in both companies as part of the deal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama's campaign did not refuse to disclose donors.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Oregon is the only state in the USA that continues to pay 100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Rand Paul has not been seen as much in recent times due to various reasons, including his focus on his Senate campaign and his health issues. However, he has not been ""shopping for a billionaire"" to fund his super PAC. Super PACs are independent political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose political candidates. They are not required to have a billionaire as a donor. The claim is a mischaracterization of the political process and Rand Paul's activities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the Mitchell Park Domes losing about $1 million-plus every year and the number of people going to the Domes has been going down is based on a general statement and does not provide specific sources or data to support it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used is not entirely accurate. While some studies have suggested that red light cameras may not significantly reduce accidents, other studies have shown that they can lead to a decrease in accidents and violations. The effectiveness of red light cameras can vary depending on the specific intersection and the implementation of the system. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 29,000 Oregonians, which is approximately 5% of all homeowners, are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage. This claim is based on a specific statistic from a reliable source, such as a government report or a reputable news outlet. Without additional context or verification, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Hate Crimes bill, also known as the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, does not target religious leaders for their sermons about sexual practices. The bill is designed to enhance penalties for hate crimes, which are crimes motivated by bias against a person's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. It does not criminalize religious teachings or moral traditions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that state school funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation. To verify this claim, we would need to look at specific data on state school funding per pupil from 2009 and the present year, adjusted for inflation. Without access to this data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on reliable sources and accurate data, it would be true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: In 2013, the number of people receiving welfare benefits in the United States was indeed higher than the number of people working. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2013, there were approximately 47.7 million people receiving some form of government assistance, while the number of people employed was around 155.5 million. Therefore, the claim that there were more people on welfare than working in 2013 is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that State Rep. Kristi Thibaut was an ACORN lobbyist is false. ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) was a community organizing group that was active in the United States from 1970 to 2010.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that any legislative action taken now could be nullified by a decision of the Supreme Court expected this June. This is a speculative statement and does not provide specific details about the legislative actions or the Supreme Court's expected decision.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the current administration and Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control is not accurate. In fact, the Trump administration, which was in power from 2017 to 2021, requested and received significant funding for border security, including the construction of the border wall. The Biden administration has also requested and received funding for border security, although the specifics of how that funding is allocated and used have been a subject of debate and criticism. Therefore, the claim that funding has been systematically cut is misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Mitt Romney released his tax returns during his 2012 presidential campaign. He released two years of tax returns in 2012, and in 2016, he released his tax returns for the previous two years. Therefore, the claim that he is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns is false.

"Explanation: The claim that Obama's tax plan cuts taxes ""for 95 percent of all working families"" is a simplification and an exaggeration. While the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Obama, did include tax cuts for many Americans, it is not accurate to say that 95 percent of all working families benefited from these cuts. The tax cuts were targeted at lower- and middle-income individuals and families, but the percentage of beneficiaries was not as high as 95 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 59 percent of Americans believe Barack Obama is still a Muslim is false. According to various polls and surveys, the majority of Americans do not believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim.

Therefore, the claim that 59 percent of Americans hold this belief is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Carol Shea-Porter wants to increase taxes on small businesses and job creators is a political statement that can be interpreted differently based on the context and specific policies she has proposed. Without specific details or a clear source, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim. However, if the claim is based on general political rhetoric or specific policy proposals, it would need to be evaluated within that context.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific context or source.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. A bill delaying the start of classes until Labor Day would not necessarily shave 5 full weeks off the school year. The actual number of weeks shaved would depend on the specific dates of Labor Day and the current start date of the school year. Additionally, the claim assumes that the school year would end on the same date as it would have without the delay, which is not necessarily the case.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about whether the United States should intervene in Libya is a political and strategic question that does not have a definitive true or false answer. It depends on the perspective and the criteria used to evaluate the intervention. For instance, some might argue that intervention is necessary to prevent humanitarian crises or to support democratic movements, while others might argue that it is not in the U.S.'s best interest to intervene due to potential risks, costs, and the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false in an absolute sense.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Gallup does not conduct polls in Egypt, and there is no evidence to support the claim that 70 percent of Egyptians do not want U.S. money.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: Scott Maddox has indeed run for several political offices in Florida, including for the Florida Senate and the Florida House of Representatives. However, the claim that he has run ""losing campaigns for 3 of Florida's 4 available cabinet positions"" is misleading. Cabinet positions in Florida are not elected positions but are appointed by the Governor. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Scott Maddox has run for these positions.

"Explanation: The claim that the United States is now energy independent for the first time ever is not accurate. While the U.S. has made significant strides in reducing its dependence on foreign energy sources, it is not entirely energy independent. The U.S. still imports and exports energy, and its energy independence is more about reducing dependence on specific sources rather than being completely self-sufficient. The term ""energy independence"" is often used to describe a situation where a country produces enough energy to meet its own needs without relying on imports from other countries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour last year is false. This figure is not accurate and does not reflect the company's actual earnings. Exxon's annual earnings are significantly lower than the claimed hourly figure. For instance, in 2021, Exxon's net income was approximately $19.4 billion, which translates to about $53 million per day or $2.2 million per hour, not $4.7 million per hour.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Republican Sen. John McCain won more votes in Cuyahoga County in the 2008 general election than he did in seven states.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of African American men currently in the U.S. criminal justice system (prison, jail, probation, or parole) to the number of enslaved African Americans in 1850. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, as of 2019, there were approximately 2.2 million African American men in the U.S. criminal justice system. In 1850, the U.S. Census reported approximately 3.9 million enslaved African Americans. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that limiting labor negotiations to only wages is how it is for the most part in the private sector is not entirely accurate.

These negotiations can be quite comprehensive and are not limited solely to wages.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Del Valle, a neighborhood in Austin, Texas, has several grocery stores within its vicinity. The closest grocery stores to Del Valle are located in the area itself, such as H-E-B and Walmart, which are both within a short driving distance. Therefore, residents of Del Valle do not need to drive to Bastrop to access the closest grocery store.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mark Warner voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt is false. Mark Warner has been a consistent advocate for fiscal responsibility and has voted against many of the tax increases and debt increases proposed by the Democratic Party. He has also been critical of excessive government spending and has voted against many of the spending bills proposed by the Democratic Party. Therefore, the claim that he voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt is inaccurate and misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a United Nations arms treaty would almost certainly force the U.S. to create an international gun registry and set the stage for full-scale gun confiscation is false. The United Nations has no authority to force the U.S. to create an international gun registry or confiscate guns. The U.S. is not a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), and the treaty does not require any country to create a gun registry or confiscate guns. The ATT is a voluntary agreement that aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, and it does not impose any obligations on non-signatory countries like the U.S.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there was ""virtually no international pressure on Iran"" when a certain administration took office is a subjective statement and can be difficult to verify without specific context.

"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is dead last in income growth among midwestern states during Gov. Scott Walker's term is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Wisconsin's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was higher than several other midwestern states during Walker's tenure as governor. For example, in 2015, Wisconsin's GDP growth rate was 2.5%, which was higher than states like Illinois (1.8%) and Michigan (1.6%). Therefore, the claim that Wisconsin is dead last in income growth is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about a three-cents-per-ounce soda tax in Philadelphia resulting in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry is based on a study conducted by the Center for Local Government Finance and Policy. The study estimated that a soda tax could lead to job losses in the beverage industry, including those held by Teamsters. However, the specific number of 2,000 jobs is not universally accepted and is subject to debate. The impact of a soda tax on jobs can vary depending on factors such as the size of the tax, the economic conditions in the region, and the response of the beverage industry.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or not definitively true based on the available information.)"

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that 51 percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax is based on a misinterpretation of data. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reports that about 44% of tax filers do not owe any federal income tax because they have no taxable income or their tax credits and deductions exceed their tax liability. However, this does not mean that 51% of filers paid zero tax; it means that 51% of tax filers had no taxable income or their tax credits and deductions covered their tax liability.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin has been losing jobs at rates not seen in decades since Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took office is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been relatively stable and has not shown a significant increase since Walker took office in 2011. In fact, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been lower than the national average for much of Walker's tenure. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that unions take away hard-earned money from teachers, firefighters, and police officers to play politics is a generalization and often a misrepresentation of the role of unions. Unions primarily exist to negotiate better wages, benefits, and working conditions for their members. The dues collected from members are used to fund these negotiations, legal battles, and other services provided to the members. The idea that these funds are used solely for political purposes is a common misconception. While unions may contribute to political campaigns, this is typically done through separate political action committees (PACs) and is not a primary use of member dues.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: President George W. Bush did indeed conduct interviews with the New York Times during his presidency. For instance, he granted an interview to the New York Times in 2004, which was published on October 10, 2004.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 2,000 high schools, which is approximately 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States, produce about half of the nation's dropouts. This claim is false because it is not possible for a specific number of schools to produce half of the nation's dropouts. The number of dropouts is distributed across a much larger number of schools, and the claim does not provide any evidence or data to support this specific percentage.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Atlanta Housing Authority, which found that approximately 40% of Atlanta households spend more than 30% of their income on rent. This study was published in 2019 and is a reliable source of information. Therefore, the claim is true.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the debt accumulated under the current president to the debt accumulated under all previous presidents combined. This is a complex comparison that requires specific data and context. Without specific data points or a clear definition of ""all those other presidents,"" it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. However, if we consider the total debt accumulated under the current president and compare it to the total debt accumulated under all previous presidents, the claim could be true or false depending on the specific data.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim that annual precipitation has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century is not accurate. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average annual precipitation in Rhode Island has increased by about 4 inches over the last century.

"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV (Bureau of Motor Vehicles) is false. Ohio has a process in place to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV.

This process ensures that voter registrations are kept up-to-date with the most current address information.

"Explanation: The claim that the most likely triggering cause of microcephaly is the DTaP shot is false. The most widely accepted cause of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015-2016 was the Zika virus, which was transmitted by mosquitoes. The Zika virus infection during pregnancy has been linked to microcephaly in newborns. The DTaP vaccine is a different vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, and it is not associated with microcephaly. The Brazilian government's mandate for the DTaP vaccine was unrelated to the Zika virus outbreak.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening)"" is a simplification and an exaggeration of the current job market situation. While it is true that the unemployment rate has been fluctuating and there are periods where the number of job seekers exceeds the number of job openings, the claim that there are three people looking for every job is not accurate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that as of the latest data, the ratio of job seekers to job openings is not as high as three to one. Therefore, the claim is an overstatement and is not entirely true.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton's ""baby bond"" proposal, as outlined in her 2019 book ""What Happened,"" is a plan to provide a $5,000 trust fund for every child born in the United States. The claim incorrectly states that this would total $20 billion per year and then multiplies it by four years to reach $80 billion. The correct calculation would be $5,000 per child per year, which would indeed total $20 billion per year for 4 million births. However, the claim incorrectly multiplies this annual total by four years, which is not part of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island would be the first state in the nation to implement a hybrid retirement plan is not accurate. Hybrid retirement plans, which combine elements of defined benefit and defined contribution plans, have been implemented in various states and organizations across the United States.

"Explanation: The claim that the State Department reduced security in Libya before the Benghazi attacks is a matter of ongoing debate and has been the subject of multiple investigations and reports. The Accountability Review Board (ARB) report on the Benghazi attacks found that the State Department had requested additional security for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, but the requests were not always granted in a timely manner. However, the report also noted that the security situation in Libya was complex and that the U.S. government was working to improve security measures. The claim that security was actually reduced is not supported by the ARB report or other credible sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Failure to raise the debt limit does not directly force a U.S. default on debt payments. However, it can lead to a default if the government is unable to pay its bills, including interest on its debt. This is because the debt limit is the legal limit on how much debt the U.S. government can accumulate. If the debt limit is not raised, the government may not have enough money to pay its bills, including interest on its debt, which could lead to a default.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Democrats in the Legislature in 2009 voted for various pork projects including a $5 million scoreboard for the Milwaukee Bucks is false.

The arena project was part of a broader agreement that included public funding, but the specific details of the scoreboard's funding were not part of the 2009 legislative session.

In fact, the Department of Education was established under the administration of Republican President Richard Nixon in 1979.

The size of the Department of Education has fluctuated over time, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it was doubled under any specific administration.

"Explanation: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has indeed called for an immediate federal monitor for the Newark Police Department. This was done in response to concerns about the department's use of force and racial profiling.

Therefore, the claim that the ACLU did not call for an investigation but instead called for an immediate federal monitor is true.

Additionally, he supported comprehensive immigration reform that included measures to improve border security and streamline the immigration process.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work is a simplification of a complex issue. While job creation and economic recovery are indeed significant concerns for many Americans, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not accurate to say that this is the only or the most pressing issue for all Americans. Other important issues include healthcare, education, racial justice, climate change, and political polarization, among others. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that in 1944 we were in debt more than twice as much as we are now is false. In 1944, the U.S. national debt was approximately $280 billion, which was about 120% of the GDP. In 2021, the U.S. national debt was around $28 trillion, which was about 120% of the GDP. Therefore, the debt in 1944 was not more than twice as much as it is now.

"Explanation: The claim is about economic indicators and forecasts from private forecasters.

"Explanation: The claim that veterans disability claims backlog doubled in Obama's first term is false. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the backlog of disability claims was approximately 260,000 in 2009 when Obama took office. By 2012, the backlog had decreased to around 200,000.

"Explanation: The claim about abortion is a complex issue that involves legal, ethical, and medical aspects. The truthfulness of the claim depends on the specific statement being made. For example, if the claim is ""Abortion is illegal in all 50 states,"" this would be false because abortion laws vary by state in the United States. If the claim is ""Abortion is a safe medical procedure,"" this would be true as it is a common and safe procedure when performed by trained medical professionals. Without a specific claim to evaluate, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Answer: N/A (The claim is too vague to evaluate as true or false.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of infant deaths following attempted abortions is not accurate. The Guttmacher Institute, a leading research and policy organization, reports that in 2010, there were 1,270 infant deaths due to complications from attempted abortions.

However, if we consider the general trend of tax policy changes over time, it is possible that tax rates have changed, but this would require detailed analysis of tax policies and their impacts on the average middle-class family.

"Explanation: The claim that veterans are being treated worse than illegal immigrants is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that veterans often face challenges in accessing healthcare and other services, it is not accurate to say that they are being treated worse than illegal immigrants.

The claim is misleading and oversimplifies the issues faced by both groups.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health organizations, the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but it is not twice as much as any other nation.

"Explanation: The claim that we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance annually is not accurate. According to the IRS, the total amount of money collected from taxes in the United States in 2020 was approximately $3.5 trillion. The cost of tax compliance, which includes the cost of tax preparation, tax collection, and tax enforcement, is a fraction of the total tax revenue. The military budget for the United States in 2020 was approximately $722 billion. Therefore, the claim that tax compliance costs are equal to the entire military budget is false.

While the U.S. has seen significant job growth in recent years, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not accurate to say that this is the fastest pace in the country's history. The fastest rate of job growth in the U.S. occurred in the late 1990s, with a peak of 3.2% in 1999.

"Explanation: The claim is based on the observation that Georgia voters are increasingly taking advantage of early voting opportunities. This statement is generally true as early voting has been on the rise in many states, including Georgia, due to various factors such as convenience, safety concerns, and increased awareness of the importance of voting. However, without specific data or statistics to support the claim, it is difficult to quantify the extent of the increase.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Ocean Spray is moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania largely because of costs associated with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is false. The RGGI is a cap-and-trade program that requires power plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it does not directly affect the costs of manufacturing facilities like Ocean Spray's. The company has cited other reasons for the move, such as the need for a larger facility to accommodate growth and the desire to be closer to its customers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not run for the presidency in 2012; he ran in 2012. The year ""2012"" is already mentioned in the claim, so it should be ""in 2012"" instead of ""On running for the presidency in 2012.""

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific comparison of prison time for first-degree murderers among Northeastern states. To verify this claim, one would need to compare the parole eligibility periods for first-degree murderers in each Northeastern state. However, without specific data or a reliable source, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be accurately judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Social Security was indeed signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, but it had bipartisan support in Congress. The bill passed the House of Representatives with 371 votes in favor and 36 votes against, with 13 Republicans voting in favor and 33 against. Medicare, on the other hand, was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, but it also had bipartisan support in Congress. The bill passed the House of Representatives with 307 votes in favor and 109 votes against, with 100 Republicans voting in favor and 99 against. The claim that Medicare was done without Republican support until the last vote is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Diane Black, a former U.S. Representative from Tennessee, voted against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) multiple times during her tenure in Congress. She was a vocal opponent of the healthcare reform law and voted against its passage in 2010. Therefore, the claim that she voted to fund Obamacare is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Congress has placed limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to use military force in the past. For example, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops abroad, and Congress can vote to end the deployment. Additionally, the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed after the 9/11 attacks has been used to justify military action against various groups, including the Islamic State. Therefore, the current debate over authorizing military action against the Islamic State is not the first time Congress has placed limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to use military force.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Marijuana has been cultivated and processed differently over time, leading to variations in potency and composition. The marijuana smoked today is often more potent due to advancements in cultivation techniques and the use of different strains. Additionally, the legal status and availability of marijuana have changed significantly over the past 40 years, which can also affect the type of marijuana available to users.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama voted against born alive legislation in Illinois is false. In 2002, when Barack Obama was a state senator in Illinois, he voted in favor of a bill that would have required medical professionals to provide care to infants born alive. This bill was similar to the federal Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2005. The claim that Obama voted against such legislation is a misrepresentation of his voting record.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: During his presidency, Barack Obama did indeed open up several new trade relationships. Some notable examples include the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was a trade agreement involving 12 countries, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which was a proposed trade agreement between the United States and the European Union. Therefore, the claim that President Obama opened up no new trade relationships is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that job growth always lags behind economic growth is not universally true. While it is often the case that job growth may not immediately match economic growth due to various factors such as structural changes in the economy, technological advancements, and shifts in industry, it is not accurate to say that job growth always lags behind economic growth. Economic growth can sometimes lead to job growth, especially in sectors that are expanding or experiencing technological advancements. Therefore, the claim is not universally applicable.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former U.S. President Barack Obama described Iran as a ""tiny"" country and said it doesn't pose a serious threat is false.

According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's historical data, in 2020, the U.S. spent approximately $1.07 trillion on entitlements and $1.02 trillion on debt services, while spending $722 billion on defense. This means that the U.S. spent about 1.5 times more on entitlements and debt services combined than on defense, not three times more.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""the American people overwhelmingly said we dont want Obamacare and we dont want amnesty"" in the 2014 elections is false. While there was significant opposition to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and immigration reform (amnesty) among some segments of the population, it is not accurate to say that the American people overwhelmingly rejected these policies. The 2014 midterm elections saw a mix of support and opposition to these issues, and the results were not a clear mandate against either policy. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that the American people overwhelmingly rejected these policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The approval ratings of Congress are not directly related to the re-election rates of incumbent lawmakers. Approval ratings reflect the public's opinion of Congress as a whole, while re-election rates are a measure of individual lawmakers' success in their campaigns. The approval ratings of Congress can be low due to various reasons, such as public dissatisfaction with specific policies or events, but this does not necessarily impact the re-election rates of individual members.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0/1 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
"Explanation: The claim that Ohio has lost more population than every other state in the country except for two is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Ohio's population has been declining since 2010, but it is not the state with the highest population loss. As of 2021, the states with the highest population losses are West Virginia, Illinois, and Michigan, with Ohio ranking 10th in terms of population loss.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about ""On support for the auto bailouts"" is vague and does not provide specific details or context.

Without this context, it is impossible to determine if the claim is true or false.

"Explanation: The claim that income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent is false. The highest marginal income tax rate during Eisenhower's presidency was 92% in 1953, but it was reduced to 91% in 1954 and 90% in 1955. However, these rates applied to the highest income brackets and were not representative of the overall tax rates for most Americans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the staffing ratio of officers to residents in Seattle to the current staffing ratio in the department in question. To verify this claim, we would need to know the specific staffing ratio in Seattle and the current staffing ratio in the department.

"Explanation: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has specific policies regarding the use of medical marijuana. While VA doctors are not prohibited from discussing medical marijuana with veterans, they are not allowed to recommend or prescribe it. The VA's policy states that veterans should not use medical marijuana, and VA doctors are not authorized to recommend it. Therefore, the claim that VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana is true.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Marquette University does not have a process for ""unsealing"" records.

The U.S. does provide foreign aid to other countries, but not to Cuba or Venezuela.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), does not provide Mexican citizens with stronger claims to Social Security benefits or protection against cuts compared to U.S. citizens. The agreement primarily focuses on trade and economic issues, not social security benefits. Mexican citizens would still be subject to the same rules and regulations regarding Social Security benefits as they are now, and there is no indication that they would have stronger claims or protection against cuts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in Florida refused to carry out the effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls"" is false. While there have been efforts to remove noncitizens from voter rolls in Florida, it is not accurate to say that all 67 supervisors of elections refused to participate. Some supervisors have cooperated with these efforts, while others have expressed concerns or refused to carry out certain aspects of the process. Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing votes in two different states, Wisconsin and New York, for two different candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The claim is not comparing votes within the same state or for the same candidate. Therefore, it is not possible to directly compare the votes earned by Biden in Wisconsin with the votes earned by Trump in New York.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Crist's veto clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in Florida is false. In 2021, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that prohibited the use of state funds for abortion services, including abortions performed in public hospitals. This bill was not affected by any veto from Governor Crist, who was not in office at the time. Therefore, the claim is misleading and incorrect.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Ohio House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, has not voted to change the process for drawing legislative boundaries to create objective criteria and modify the Constitution. The redistricting process in Ohio is currently controlled by the Republican-led legislature, and there is no evidence to suggest that they have voted to change the process to make it more objective or to take politics out of it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is responsible for over $14 trillion in debt is false. Debt accumulation is a result of the actions of the entire government, including the executive branch and Congress, and is not attributable to a single individual. Sen. Brown has been a member of Congress since 1993 and has served in various capacities, but the debt level is a cumulative figure that reflects the policies and actions of multiple administrations and Congresses over many years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that consumers save an average of $500 per car sold through franchised dealer model compared to direct sales by manufacturers is not universally accurate. The savings can vary greatly depending on the specific manufacturer, the model of the car, the location, and the individual dealership's pricing strategies. Additionally, direct sales by manufacturers often come with additional perks like lower overhead costs, which can sometimes offset the savings. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance both before and after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is misleading. While it is true that Wisconsin had a high rate of insurance coverage before Obamacare, the claim that the rate remained unchanged after the implementation is inaccurate. The Affordable Care Act expanded access to health insurance, particularly for low-income individuals and families, which led to an increase in the number of people with health insurance coverage. Therefore, the claim that Obamacare had no impact on insurance coverage rates is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the Atlanta Streetcar creating 1,399 jobs is based on a study conducted by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) in 2014.

Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is one of the bluest states and that under Scott Walker its unemployment rate is around 3.5% is partially true. Wisconsin is indeed considered a ""blue"" state, meaning it tends to vote Democratic. However, the unemployment rate under Scott Walker, who served as governor from 2011 to 2019, was not around 3.5%. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin during his tenure varied, but it was generally higher than 3.5%. For example, in 2015, the unemployment rate was around 5.5%, and in 2019, it was around 3.2%.

"Explanation: The claim ""I don't have lobbyists running my campaign"" is a statement made by a candidate or political figure. The truthfulness of this claim depends on the specific context and the definition of ""lobbyists."" In political campaigns, ""lobbyists"" can refer to individuals or groups who advocate for or against specific policies or candidates. If the candidate is referring to professional lobbyists who are actively working on their behalf, then the claim would be false if such individuals are indeed involved. However, if the candidate is referring to informal supporters or volunteers, the claim could be true. Without specific information about the context and the definition of ""lobbyists,"" it is not possible to definitively judge the truthfulness of the claim.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that alcohol is illegal for individuals under 21 in many jurisdictions, this does not mean that underage alcohol use has increased.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to improve access to healthcare and reduce administrative burdens.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

"Explanation: The claim that Tammy Baldwin supports a law in which the government will take over your decisions on medicine, doctors, and hospitals is false. Tammy Baldwin, a Democratic Senator from Wisconsin, has been a strong advocate for healthcare reform, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare for All proposals. However, these proposals do not involve the government taking over individual decisions about medicine, doctors, and hospitals. Instead, they aim to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of her positions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) will cause Medicare to ""go away in less than 10 years"" is a misrepresentation of the facts. The Affordable Care Act was designed to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by reducing waste, fraud, and abuse, and by encouraging preventive care and wellness programs. The claim that Medicare will ""fall apart at the seams"" due to Obamacare is not supported by evidence or expert analysis. The Medicare Trustees' Report for 2021 projects that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted by 2026, but this is due to long-term trends in healthcare costs and demographics, not specifically due to the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Sen. John McCain did not spend the July 4 weekend in Islamabad, Pakistan, selling F-16s and advanced weapons. McCain was a prominent figure in U.S. politics and was known for his involvement in foreign policy, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he was in Pakistan during that time or that he was involved in selling weapons to the Pakistani government. Additionally, the claim that Pakistan ""harbored Osama bin Laden"" is also false, as bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in 2011, and the U.S. military operation that led to his death was conducted in Abbottabad, Pakistan, not Islamabad.

"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama's plan calls for ""mandates and fines for small businesses"" is false. During his presidency, Obama's administration implemented the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which included provisions for small businesses to provide health insurance to their employees. However, the ACA did not mandate that all small businesses provide health insurance, nor did it impose fines specifically for small businesses that did not comply with the law. The fines were primarily targeted at larger businesses that did not offer health insurance to their employees.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the area near the proposed northern Wisconsin iron ore mine is 15 hours away from where the public hearing on mining was held. This claim is false because the distance between two locations is typically measured in miles or kilometers, not hours. The time it takes to travel between two locations depends on the mode of transportation and the speed at which it travels. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine the distance between two locations using hours as the unit of measurement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Our credit rating went up since I've been in office"" is a subjective statement that depends on the specific context and the time frame in question. Credit ratings are influenced by various economic factors and policies, and it's not always clear whether a specific leader's actions directly led to an improvement in the credit rating. Therefore, without specific data or evidence, it's difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that African-American children are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids is an exaggeration. While it is true that African-American children are disproportionately affected by asthma, the mortality rate is not 500 percent higher. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), African-American children are about 2.5 times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma and 2.5 times more likely to die from asthma than white children. This is a significant disparity, but it is not 500 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of people killed by U.S. police in a single month to the number killed by U.K. police over a century. This is a misleading comparison because it does not account for the population size, the time period, or the context of each country's law enforcement practices. The U.S. has a much larger population and a higher rate of police interactions, which would naturally lead to a higher number of deaths. The U.K., on the other hand, has a smaller population and a different legal and cultural context. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios is false.

"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies, specifically corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns and got $570 million in job-development incentives, is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that Scott Walker's administration provided job-development incentives to various businesses, including those that had contributed to his campaigns, the claim that $570 million was specifically given to his cronies is not supported by verifiable evidence. The amount of $570 million is not explicitly tied to his cronies or campaign contributors in any publicly available records or reports.

"Explanation: The claim that Burger King is pulling its franchises from military bases due to actions by President Barack Obama is false.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about surveys conducted with Wisconsin employers. While it is possible that some employers have cited the anti-business litigation climate as a factor affecting their expansion decisions, it is not specific enough to be verified as true or false without additional context or data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there were no government benefits for immigrants when the grandfather arrived in the United States is false. While it is true that the current system of government benefits for immigrants is more extensive than it was in the past, there were indeed some forms of assistance available to immigrants in the early 20th century. For example, the Dillingham Commission, established in 1907, recommended that immigrants be provided with assistance in finding jobs and housing. Additionally, some states and cities offered assistance to immigrants through public works programs and other initiatives. Therefore, the claim that there were no government benefits for immigrants is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal aid for Medicaid expansion is not a tax that can be redirected to other states. Medicaid is a federal program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals and families. When a state chooses not to expand Medicaid, it does not send federal funds to other states. Instead, the federal funds remain with the state that chose not to expand Medicaid. The claim is a misinterpretation of how Medicaid funding works.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""a third of all the young people in America are not in America today because of abortion"" is misleading and inaccurate. While it is true that one in three pregnancies in the United States end in abortion, this does not mean that one in three young people are not in America today due to abortion. The claim confuses the number of pregnancies that end in abortion with the number of young people who are not in America. The number of young people in America is not directly affected by the number of abortions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Same-sex marriage is a legal recognition of a marriage between two people of the same sex. This practice has been legalized in many countries and is widely accepted in many societies. Therefore, the claim that same-sex marriage is a true statement.

"Explanation: The federal gas tax in the United States has indeed been raised since 1993. The current federal gas tax rate is 18.4 cents per gallon for regular gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel fuel, which was last increased in 1993. However, the claim that the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993 is false because it has been raised multiple times since then, including in 1993 itself.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker's budget includes ""No weekend for workers"" is a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual policy. Scott Walker, a former governor of Wisconsin, implemented a policy that required state employees to work on Saturdays and Sundays, but this was not a complete elimination of weekends for workers. The policy was aimed at reducing the state's budget deficit and did not mean that all workers would have no weekend at all. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did not give control of Medicare patients' healthcare decisions to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats. The ACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was intended to make recommendations to Congress on how to reduce Medicare spending. However, the IPAB was never activated, and its powers were repealed in 2019. The claim misrepresents the role and existence of the IPAB.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that under Hillary Clinton, State Department officials were sending official thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation is false. The Clinton Foundation is a private organization, and it is not appropriate for government officials to send official thank-yous to individuals for donations to a private foundation. This practice would be a violation of government ethics rules and could be seen as a conflict of interest.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States is not the only nation that affords citizenship to anyone born within its borders, regardless of the legal status of their parents. Many countries, including Canada, Mexico, and several European nations, have similar policies. For example, Canada's Citizenship Act grants citizenship to anyone born in Canada, regardless of their parents' immigration status. Similarly, Mexico's constitution grants citizenship to anyone born in Mexico, regardless of their parents' immigration status.

"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood provides about 140 visits for prenatal care in each state is false. Planned Parenthood does provide prenatal care services, but the number of visits per state is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that in 41 states, government workers are better paid than the taxpayers who support them is not accurate. While it is true that government workers often have higher salaries and benefits compared to private sector workers, the claim that this is true in 41 states is an oversimplification and not supported by comprehensive data. The claim does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement, making it difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that John McCain said last year he didn't know of a solution to the mortgage crisis is false. John McCain, a former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate, has publicly discussed and proposed solutions to the mortgage crisis. He has advocated for various measures, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and other financial reforms. Therefore, the claim that he didn't know of a solution is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney said ""'No' to in-state tuition"" for illegal immigrants is false. Mitt Romney, during his 2012 presidential campaign, did propose a plan to deny in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, but he did not explicitly say ""'No' to in-state tuition"" in the way the claim suggests. The claim is a misrepresentation of Romney's stance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, it is illegal to perform an abortion without the consent of the pregnant person. Additionally, administering medication to a child without permission is also illegal and unethical. The claim also suggests that it is acceptable to secretly take a child off for an abortion, which is not only illegal but also highly unethical and harmful.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about a specific demographic group (single adults, ages 21 to 25 with no kids) and does not provide any specific data or source to support the claim. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time period or the geographical location, which could affect the validity of the statement.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama plans to impose a tax of at least 23 percent on the Medicare prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries is false. There is no evidence or official statement from President Obama or his administration indicating such a plan. Medicare prescription drug benefits are funded through a combination of premiums, taxes, and government contributions, and any changes to these benefits would typically be announced and discussed in the context of broader healthcare reform initiatives.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario and does not provide any specific source or data to support it. President Obama's policies were in effect during the 2008-2016 period, and the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 4.7%. The claim does not provide any evidence or data to suggest that continuing with his policies would lead to a 9% unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the following year.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is asking for an opinion on how the federal government should spend Florida's rejected high-speed rail money. This is a subjective and political question that does not have a definitive true or false answer. It is a matter of policy and personal belief rather than a factual statement that can be verified as true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Barack Obama has enacted a law that requires healthcare professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government for the purpose of gun confiscation. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law by President Obama, does not include such provisions. Additionally, the ACA does not give the government the authority to confiscate guns based on medical data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of the latest data, the population of Florida is indeed approximately 19 million people. The combined population of the earlier primary and caucus states (such as Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada) is significantly less than 19 million. Therefore, the claim that the population of Florida is larger than all the earlier primary and caucus states combined is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct and arbitrary comparison between the cost of an ESD superintendent position and the cost of three speech pathologists, three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers. This comparison is not valid because the roles, responsibilities, and qualifications required for these positions are vastly different. The cost of each position is determined by various factors such as education, experience, and the specific needs of the role, not by a simple numerical ratio. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama Administration did not close 75 percent of the air traffic control towers in Republican Congressional Districts. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) closed 143 towers between 2013 and 2018, and only 40 of these were in Republican districts. This represents approximately 28 percent, not 75 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954 is false. Crimea has a complex history, but it was not part of Ukraine until 1954. Before that, it was part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union. In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev, then the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, transferred Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR as part of a territorial reorganization within the Soviet Union. This transfer was not a gift or a gesture but a formal administrative decision.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. A fiduciary responsibility is a legal and ethical obligation to act in the best interests of another party. In the context of a business, this means that the individual has a duty to act in the best interests of the business, its employees, and its shareholders. Paying no more tax than legally required is a way to maximize the value of the business, which aligns with the fiduciary responsibility.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Rick Scott was not forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud. In fact, Rick Scott was the Governor of Florida from 2011 to 2019 and has not been involved in any such fraud case. The company you are referring to is likely HCA Healthcare, which was involved in a fraud case, but Rick Scott was not the CEO or involved in the company's operations during that time.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government restricts how much salt we can put on our food is false. While the U.S. government does recommend limiting salt intake to reduce health risks, it does not impose specific restrictions on the amount of salt individuals can use in their food. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day, but this is a recommendation, not a regulation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The NClaw (North Carolina Law) for body camera footage does not give police broad authority to keep video footage secret from individuals who are filmed. In fact, North Carolina law requires that body camera footage be made available to individuals who are the subject of the footage, with certain exceptions for privacy and safety concerns. The law also provides for public access to body camera footage, subject to certain restrictions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a specific incident involving a 42-inch redfish and fishing rules. Without additional context or verification, it's difficult to determine the authenticity of this claim. However, the claim itself is not inherently impossible; it's plausible that someone could catch a 42-inch redfish and be unable to keep it due to fishing regulations.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim about the accuracy of state job numbers is complex and depends on the specific context and data source. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, for example, regularly releases data on employment and unemployment rates, which are considered reliable and accurate. However, the accuracy of state-specific job numbers can vary depending on the methodology used by individual states and the reliability of their data collection processes. Therefore, without specific details about the source and methodology of the claim, it is difficult to definitively judge its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Right now we are at 90 percent health insurance covered. That's the highest we've ever been in our country"" is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, the percentage of people without health insurance in the United States was around 8.9%, not 90%. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the No. 1 cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34 is murder is not accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading causes of death for African-American males in this age group are homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries. However, homicide is not the No. 1 cause of death overall. The CDC's data shows that unintentional injuries, such as motor vehicle accidents, are the leading cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Ron Johnson, a former CEO of J.C. Penney and a current U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has been actively involved in addressing opioid abuse and heroin addiction. He has introduced legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis, such as the ""Opioid Crisis Response Act"" and the ""Opioid Addiction Prevention Act."" Additionally, he has been vocal about the issue and has participated in various discussions and hearings on the topic. Therefore, the claim that he has done nothing to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While Virginia has been recognized for its business-friendly environment and has been ranked high in various surveys, it has not been named ""best managed state"" or ""best state to raise a child"" during the tenure of any specific governor. These rankings are typically based on comprehensive surveys and studies conducted by independent organizations, and they do not specifically attribute these rankings to any particular governor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. House candidate Carlos Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates is false. Carlos Curbelo has been a vocal opponent of raising flood insurance rates. He has advocated for reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that would make it more sustainable and affordable, but he has not supported raising rates for policyholders.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit is false. This claim originated from a series of videos released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress in 2015. However, multiple investigations, including those by the FBI and the Department of Justice, found no evidence to support the claim. The videos were later found to have been heavily edited and misrepresented the context of the conversations. Planned Parenthood has consistently denied the allegations and has stated that it does not sell fetal tissue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the new 21st State Senate district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard and was drawn within half a block of his house is a political allegation that lacks specific evidence or official confirmation. The creation of legislative districts is typically a public process involving input from various stakeholders and is subject to legal and political scrutiny. Without concrete evidence or official statements supporting this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island's voter identification law was pushed by a black Democrat in the House and a black Democrat in the Senate is false. The Rhode Island voter identification law was actually passed in 2011 by a Republican-controlled legislature. The law was not pushed by any black Democrats in the House or Senate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Jeff Greene only moved from California to Florida in the last two years and that he would not legally be allowed to run for any other statewide office because he has not lived here long enough to meet the residency requirement. This claim is false because Jeff Greene has been a resident of Florida for more than two years. He has been a resident of Florida since 2018, which means he has met the residency requirement for running for statewide office.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The individual in question, George W. Bush, was the President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 and was a strong supporter of the war in Iraq. He authorized the invasion in 2003, which was based on the premise that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The invasion was later criticized for its lack of evidence supporting the initial claims.

"Explanation: The claim states that manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three years, which contradicts the earlier statement that manufacturers have been shedding jobs for more than 10 years. These two statements are mutually exclusive and cannot both be true. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Fifty-one percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009"" is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, in 2009, approximately 46.4% of tax returns did not report any taxable income, which means they did not owe any income tax. However, this does not mean that 51% of households paid no income tax, as some households may have had taxable income but did not owe any tax due to credits or deductions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Majority Leader Eric Cantor called for abolishing Social Security and Medicare is false. While Cantor has been critical of the Social Security system and has proposed reforms, he has never advocated for its complete abolition. This claim is a misrepresentation of his actual stance.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Donald Trump, during his presidential campaign and presidency, made several statements that suggested Muslims would be subject to profiling and other forms of surveillance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards was forced to concede that 86 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenue is from abortion is false. While it is true that abortion services are a significant part of Planned Parenthood's work, the claim that 86 percent of their revenue comes from abortion is an exaggeration. According to Planned Parenthood's own financial reports, abortion services account for about 32 percent of their total revenue. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual figures.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Georgia spends more on tourism advertising than many other states in the South. For example, in 2019, Georgia spent $15.5 million on tourism advertising, while states like Alabama and South Carolina spent less. Therefore, the claim that Georgia spends fewer tourism advertising dollars than any other state in the South is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unionization rate for all private industry workers in the United States is around 6.5%, while the rate for foreign-owned companies is around 5.5%. This indicates that foreign-owned companies have a slightly lower unionization rate than the overall private industry rate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Federal grant funds for the Milwaukee streetcar project are subject to specific conditions and restrictions, but they are not exclusively tied to the streetcar project. The funds can be redirected to other modes of public transportation or to public schools if the project is canceled or if the funds are not used as intended. The claim suggests a rigid restriction that does not align with typical grant fund usage policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's deal allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon is false. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The deal included strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure Iran's compliance. It did not allow Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything"" when the United States first created the federal income tax is false. The federal income tax was implemented in 1913 with the 16th Amendment, and it initially applied to a broad range of incomes. The first tax brackets were set at 1% for incomes up to $3,000, 2% for incomes up to $5,000, and 6% for incomes above $5,000. Therefore, individuals with incomes below $3,000 did not pay any federal income tax, but those with incomes above $3,000 did pay a tax.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that there are over 300 state agencies, and 45 of those are related to healthcare.

The exact number of state agencies can vary, but the claim is generally accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Abraham Lincoln did visit Ohio during his presidency, but there is no historical evidence to support the claim that he danced in the Ohio Senate chamber. The claim is likely a myth or misinterpretation of his visit.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the premiums on Medicare's prescription drug program have fallen almost every year since it began is not accurate. Medicare Part D, the prescription drug program, has seen fluctuations in premiums over the years, but it has not consistently fallen. Premiums can vary based on factors such as the specific plan chosen, the region, and the year. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not make the statement ""This plant kills"" while pointing at a coal plant during his time as governor of Massachusetts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""No other Northeastern state has passed a photo ID law"" is false. Several Northeastern states have implemented photo ID laws. For example, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Connecticut have all passed laws requiring photo ID for voting. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""government is a barrier to innovation and development"" is not universally true. While it is true that excessive regulation, bureaucracy, or lack of support can hinder innovation, governments also play a crucial role in fostering innovation through policies, funding, and infrastructure. For instance, many governments provide funding for research and development, create regulatory environments that encourage innovation, and invest in education and infrastructure. Therefore, the claim is not accurate in its entirety.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in inner-city schools is not accurate. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the overall dropout rate for public schools in the United States was around 5% in 2019. While dropout rates can vary significantly by location and demographic, the claim of a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that individuals should unconditionally follow police orders and then deal with any potential issues later. This advice is not accurate and can be dangerous. When a police officer stops you, it is important to remain calm and cooperative, but you also have rights. You should not feel compelled to follow orders that you believe are illegal or unjust. If you feel that your rights are being violated, you should document the incident and seek legal advice.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Ohio does not have a law that explicitly allows employers or landlords to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation. In fact, Ohio's Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. Therefore, it is not legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: In Georgia, ride-sharing companies like Uber are required to carry auto insurance. However, the specifics of the insurance coverage can vary depending on the status of the driver (e.g., whether they are currently driving for the company or are off-duty). When a driver is logged into the app and waiting for a ride request, the company's insurance coverage typically applies. When the driver is off-duty, the driver's personal insurance may cover them. Therefore, the claim that Uber and other ride-share firms are not required to carry auto insurance under Georgia law is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has publicly stated her support for abortion rights, including late-term abortions, but she has also emphasized the importance of reducing the number of abortions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the conversations or the context in which they occurred.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey has the lowest corruption risk of any state due to the #jerseycomeback is not verifiable with the information provided. The #jerseycomeback is a hashtag used to promote a return to normalcy and economic recovery in New Jersey, but it does not directly correlate to a reduction in corruption risk. Corruption risk is typically measured by indices such as Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which is based on various factors including public sector corruption, political corruption, and business corruption. Without specific data or sources to support the claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a referendum on an aquarium for Clearwater will directly impact future funding for neighborhoods. However, there is no direct correlation between a local referendum on an aquarium and the funding for neighborhoods. The funding for neighborhoods is typically managed by separate budgetary processes and is not directly tied to the outcome of a local referendum on a specific project like an aquarium.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Gov. McAuliffe has vetoed more bills in two years than the previous three governors did in each of their four-year terms. To verify this claim, we would need to compare the number of bills vetoed by Gov. McAuliffe in his first two years in office with the total number of bills vetoed by the previous three governors in their four-year terms. Without specific data on the number of bills vetoed by each governor, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Everything I have said (on the campaign trail) has been factually accurate"" is a subjective statement that cannot be universally verified as true or false without specific examples and context. Political candidates often make statements that are later disputed or proven inaccurate. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false without further evidence.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that 10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes is false. The Clinton Foundation has been criticized for its spending practices, with some reports suggesting that a significant portion of its funds are used for administrative costs and salaries rather than direct charitable work. The foundation has also faced scrutiny over its donations and the influence of its donors.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security system was established in the United States in 1935, during the Great Depression. The average life expectancy at that time was around 61 years for men and 62 years for women. However, the Social Security system was designed to provide benefits to workers who had contributed to the system through payroll taxes. The age at which people could start receiving benefits was initially set at 65, which was higher than the average life expectancy at the time. Therefore, the claim that people died before they were old enough to get Social Security is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate was in 1972, as stated in the claim. However, the claim also states that ""We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate,"" which implies that the 40th anniversary is approaching. Since 1972 was 40 years ago, the claim is false because it suggests that the anniversary is still approaching, which is not the case.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Rob Cornilles has been endorsed by 20 local mayors, including Independent, Democratic, and Republican.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Attorney General Eric Holder was involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation is false. In 2009, the Department of Justice under Holder's leadership did not dismiss the charges against the New Black Panther Party. Instead, the case was dismissed due to a lack of evidence and the government's failure to prove its case. Holder himself was not directly involved in the dismissal of the charges.

Answer: 0"

The newspaper has consistently reported on the topic and has expressed concerns about the practice.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a person can drive the length of a football field (approximately 100 yards or 91.44 meters) in five seconds. This is highly unlikely because the average speed required to cover this distance in five seconds would be approximately 182.88 meters per second, which is far beyond the capabilities of any vehicle, including a car or a motorcycle. Even the fastest cars in the world cannot achieve such speeds.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the water sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 was equivalent to three years' worth of Austin's water use. This claim is misleading because it does not specify the total amount of water used by Austin in a year. Without knowing the total annual water usage of Austin, it is impossible to accurately compare the water sent to downstream rice farmers to three years' worth of Austin's water use. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Wisconsin does not require a photographic identification to vote. The state allows voters to present a variety of identification documents, including non-photographic ones, such as utility bills, bank statements, or pay stubs. This policy is in line with the state's voter ID law, which was implemented in 2011 but has since been modified to allow for a broader range of acceptable identification documents.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that learning about Donald Trump's financial dealings can be better understood by examining his financial disclosure form rather than his tax returns. This is false because financial disclosure forms and tax returns serve different purposes and provide different types of information. Financial disclosure forms provide details about assets, liabilities, and income sources, while tax returns provide information about income, deductions, and taxes paid. Both are important for understanding a person's financial situation, but they are not interchangeable. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident is true. The U.S. Navy has been operating nuclear-powered ships since the 1950s, and while there have been incidents and accidents involving nuclear reactors, none have resulted in a significant release of radioactive material. The most notable incident was the 1968 nuclear accident on the USS Thresher, which resulted in the loss of the ship and its crew, but this was not a result of a nuclear accident but rather a mechanical failure. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Therefore, the claim is false.

While it is true that Mitch McConnell has received significant donations from individuals and organizations associated with the coal industry, it is not accurate to say that he is the only candidate receiving such donations. Many other political figures, including those from both major parties, have received donations from various industries, including coal. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The national debt of the United States is approximately $16 trillion, and if we were to convert this into $1 bills, it would not cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times. The area of Ohio is approximately 44,829 square miles. If we assume each $1 bill has a thickness of 0.0043 inches (the thickness of a typical U.S. banknote), the volume of $1 bills needed to cover Ohio would be far greater than the volume of the state itself. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a study of private bail bond systems, which suggests that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states. However, without specific details about the study, its methodology, and the data used, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. Additionally, no-show rates can be influenced by various factors such as the severity of the crime, the defendant's personal circumstances, and the effectiveness of the bail bond system itself. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false without further information.

Texas, California, and New York have a combined total of 55 electoral votes, which is more than half of the 538 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. However, it is not mathematically impossible for Republicans to elect a president because the remaining states could still vote for a Republican candidate, and the candidate could win the majority of electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Texas grew by approximately 10.5 million people between 2010 and 2020. While it is true that a significant portion of this growth is due to immigration, the claim that 90 percent of this growth was non-Anglo is an overstatement. The actual percentage of non-Anglo population growth is likely to be higher than the Anglo population growth, but it is not accurate to say that 90 percent of the total growth was non-Anglo.

"Explanation: The claim that ""nobody in higher education believes Gov. Rick Perry's proposal to serve up $10,000 college degrees is possible"" is a generalization that is not supported by evidence. While there may be some critics or skeptics of the proposal, it is not accurate to say that ""nobody"" in higher education believes it is possible. The proposal has been discussed and debated by various stakeholders in higher education, including educators, administrators, and policymakers. Some may support the idea, while others may have concerns or criticisms. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the total number of violent crimes in Arizona decreased from 2019 to 2020. However, property crimes increased slightly.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: To evaluate the claim, I would need to compare the salaries of faculty members across different universities in New England. However, without specific data or a reliable source, it is challenging to verify the claim. Typically, salary comparisons are based on data from sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or specific university reports. If the claim is based on a reliable source, it would be true; otherwise, it would be false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: Preventive care, such as regular check-ups, vaccinations, and health education, can indeed save the government money in the long run. By identifying and treating health issues early, preventive care can reduce the need for more expensive treatments and hospitalizations. Additionally, preventive care can help manage chronic diseases, which can lead to lower healthcare costs. Therefore, the claim that preventive care does not save the government money is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Abraham Lincoln tried to buy slaves' freedom in border states and that the states all rejected it is false. Lincoln did propose a plan to compensate slave owners for freeing their slaves, but this was not a direct attempt to buy slaves' freedom. The plan was part of his Emancipation Proclamation, which was not accepted by all border states. However, the claim that all states rejected it is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: A 5-cent charge on paper bags is not a tax. A tax is a compulsory financial charge or levy imposed by a government authority on a person or organization for the purpose of raising revenue. A charge on paper bags is typically a fee or surcharge imposed by a retailer or a local government to encourage the use of reusable bags and reduce waste. It is not a tax because it is not imposed by a government authority for the purpose of raising revenue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the U.N. arms treaty will mandate a new international gun registry is false. The United Nations has been working on an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) since 2012, but it does not include provisions for a global gun registry. The ATT aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, but it does not require countries to establish a global registry of firearms. The treaty focuses on transparency and record-keeping in the arms trade, not on individual gun ownership.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that Rick Scott did not attend his own education summit but attended a Tea Party convention instead. This claim is false because it is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. There is no information provided to verify that Rick Scott did not attend his own education summit, and it is not accurate to imply that he attended a Tea Party convention instead without any evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The 9-9-9 plan, proposed by Andrew Yang, is a tax reform plan that includes a universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 per month for every American adult. The plan also includes a 10% value-added tax (VAT) on goods and services, and a 10% tax on corporate income. While the UBI component does not raise taxes on those making the least, the VAT and corporate tax increases would indeed raise taxes on many Americans. Therefore, the claim that the 9-9-9 plan does not raise taxes on those making the least is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""I did not support the sequester"" is a statement made by a person, and without additional context or verification, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness. The sequester refers to a budgetary process in the United States where non-discretionary spending is reduced to meet budgetary targets. The claim could be true or false depending on the specific context and the person making the statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government borrows almost $60 billion per week is false. The U.S. federal government's borrowing is typically measured in terms of the debt ceiling and the deficit, not weekly borrowing. The U.S. Treasury Department reports the federal debt on a daily basis, and the weekly borrowing figures are not a standard measure. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the federal debt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Clayton County's millage rate is indeed one of the lowest in Metro Atlanta. As of 2021, Clayton County's millage rate was 1.50, which is lower than many other counties in the region.

"Explanation: The claim is based on data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. According to the FBI's 2020 Crime in the United States report, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States decreased by 24.5% from 2000 to 2019. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm also decreased, but the percentage is not specified in the FBI report. Therefore, the claim that the number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has declined by nearly 70% is not supported by the data.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the United States spends more on its military than the next 10, 11, or 12 countries combined. However, the claim suggests that the U.S. spends more than the next 10, 11, or 12 countries combined, which is not accurate. The U.S. spends more than the next 10 countries combined, but not the next 11 or 12.

"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or credible source that supports the statement that a federal judge has sanctioned a Tennessee birther lawyer for bringing a frivolous lawsuit. The term ""birther"" is often used to describe individuals who question the citizenship of U.S. President Barack Obama, but there is no record of a federal judge taking such action against a lawyer in this context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that property taxes in 2009 were $3 billion below those in 2007 due to tax cuts and lower property values. However, without specific data or sources to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Property tax rates and values can be influenced by various factors, and a decrease of $3 billion over two years is a significant change that would typically require detailed economic analysis and data to substantiate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that food stamp spending doubled under President Bush and doubled again under President Obama is not accurate. While it is true that food stamp spending increased significantly during both administrations, the claim of doubling is an oversimplification. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food stamp spending increased from $30 billion in 2001 to $78 billion in 2009 under President Bush, and then to $80 billion in 2013 under President Obama. This represents a significant increase, but not a doubling in each case.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the cost of a college education increased by 439 percent between 1982 and 2007 is based on a study by the College Board, which reported that the cost of tuition and fees at public institutions increased by 439 percent over that period. However, this figure includes only tuition and fees, not room and board, which are also significant components of the total cost of attendance. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of tuition and fees, it is misleading because it does not account for the full cost of attendance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""most tips left at Dunkin Donuts don't go to employees"" is false. In the United States, tips are typically distributed to employees, including baristas, through a system called ""tip pooling."" This means that tips are collected and then divided among all employees who work in the establishment. The exact distribution can vary by location and company policy, but the general practice is that tips are shared among the staff.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On banning assault weapons"" is incomplete and lacks specific context. To evaluate its truthfulness, we need to know the specific context or the statement that is being made about banning assault weapons. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine if the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. loses more on tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes is not accurate. According to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the total amount of tax breaks (or tax expenditures) in the U.S. is significantly less than the total amount of personal income taxes collected. For example, in 2019, the IRS reported that the total amount of tax expenditures was approximately $1.6 trillion, while the total amount of personal income taxes collected was around $1.4 trillion. Therefore, the U.S. does not lose more on tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals in California are ""a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare"" is misleading. While it is true that some undocumented immigrants may receive certain benefits, such as emergency medical care, it is not accurate to say that these benefits are a ""skyrocketing cost under Obamacare."" Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not provide benefits to undocumented immigrants. The ACA primarily provides benefits to U.S. citizens and legal residents. Additionally, the cost of benefits for undocumented immigrants is not funded by taxpayers but rather by the undocumented immigrants themselves through their own contributions to the healthcare system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""every income tax bracket will increase on Jan. 1, 2011"" is not accurate. The 2010 Tax Relief Act, which was signed into law by President Obama, extended the Bush-era tax cuts for two years, but it did not increase all income tax brackets. The tax cuts were extended for most taxpayers, but some high-income individuals saw their tax rates increase. Therefore, the claim that ""every income tax bracket will increase"" is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Jeanne Shaheen was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama's political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election is false. The IRS scandal, also known as the ""IRS targeting scandal,"" involved the IRS's practice of scrutinizing conservative and liberal nonprofit groups differently. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Jeanne Shaheen was involved in this plot. The investigation into the IRS targeting scandal did not implicate Jeanne Shaheen.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The King Street Patriots is a group that promotes conservative and libertarian views, and they have held fundraisers featuring various speakers. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they have ever featured an author who believes that registering the poor to vote is un-American. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of the group's activities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Bridge to Nowhere"" was a project that was proposed by Alaska Senator Ted Stevens in 2005. The project was intended to build a bridge to the remote island of Gravina in the Aleutian Islands. However, the project was highly controversial and was eventually canceled. The claim that the senator was one of a dozen who voted against the project is incorrect because the project was never voted on by the Senate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is asking about a hypothetical situation where someone is considering running for the U.S. Senate as an independent. This is a general statement about a potential action and does not provide specific information about a particular person or event.

"Explanation: The claim that there is a Republican plan to end Medicare is false. While there have been discussions and proposals within the Republican Party to modify or reform Medicare, there is no current plan or proposal to completely end the program. Medicare is a significant part of the U.S. healthcare system, and any changes to it would likely be incremental and subject to extensive debate and political process.

Additionally, the amendment was not included in the final version of the crime bill.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While Texas has been increasing funding for women's health services, the statement that they just increased their level by another $50 million for the next two years is not accurate. The Texas Department of State Health Services has been receiving increased funding for women's health services, but the specific amount of $50 million for the next two years is not supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Tennessee's higher education funding model is 100 percent outcomes-based and that this model is already changing the way postsecondary institutions do business is not entirely accurate. While Tennessee has implemented a performance-based funding model, it is not exclusively outcomes-based. The model includes factors such as student retention, graduation rates, and other performance metrics, but it also considers other factors like institutional size and student demographics. Therefore, the claim that it is 100 percent outcomes-based is an overstatement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Islanders pay among the highest auto repair bills in the nation is not supported by reliable data. While Rhode Island may have higher costs for certain services, it is not accurate to say that it consistently ranks among the highest in the nation. Costs for auto repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific service, the location within the state, and the type of vehicle. Therefore, the claim is not true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that a particular U.S. Senator is running for re-election. However, it is a common practice for U.S. Senators to run for re-election, and many do so regularly. Therefore, the claim is not specific enough to be false, and it is a plausible scenario.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that overdosing is now the number one accidental killer in the Commonwealth is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading cause of accidental death in the United States is unintentional injuries, which include motor vehicle accidents, falls, and drowning.

"Explanation: The claim that the Ryan budget gets rid of Medicare in 10 years and turns it into a voucher program is false. The Ryan budget, proposed by then-Rep. Paul Ryan in 2011, did propose changes to Medicare, including a shift to a voucher system for future beneficiaries. However, it did not eliminate Medicare entirely. The voucher system would have provided beneficiaries with a set amount to purchase private insurance, but Medicare would have continued to exist for current beneficiaries. The claim that Medicare would be eliminated in 10 years is a misrepresentation of the Ryan budget's proposals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the increase in the garbage tax imposed by Mayor Allan Fung in Cranston being as much as $200 is not supported by any reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA does not require Americans to give up their current health plans. Instead, it provides options for those who may not have access to affordable coverage or want to change their plans. The prediction that 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan is a misrepresentation of the ACA's impact. The ACA aims to expand coverage, not to force people to change their plans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a specific action taken by the individual in their role as a State Legislator. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting records of the legislator for any tax increase bills they voted on. Without access to this specific data, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be accurately judged as true or false.

Answer: N/A"
"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. is spending millions for each individual held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is not accurate. The cost of detaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay is not primarily based on the number of detainees but rather on the overall operational costs of the facility. The U.S. government has not publicly disclosed the exact cost per detainee, but it is known that the total cost of the detention facility and operations is significant. However, the claim that spending is directly proportional to the number of detainees is misleading.

"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama won't use the term ""war on terrorism"" is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama frequently used the term ""war on terrorism"" in his speeches and policy statements. For example, in his 2009 speech at the National Defense University, he stated, ""We must also recognize that our military efforts alone will not be enough to defeat the terrorists."" This statement, among others, demonstrates that he did indeed use the term.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Senate opponent Tammy Baldwin supported a federal budget that spent trillions more money than the Obama budget is misleading. The federal budget for the fiscal year 2021, which was signed into law by President Biden, was approximately $4.8 trillion. The federal budget for the fiscal year 2016, which was the last full year of the Obama administration, was approximately $3.9 trillion. While the 2021 budget is larger than the 2016 budget, the difference is not in the trillions but rather in the hundreds of billions. Additionally, the claim does not specify which budget Tammy Baldwin supported, and her voting record does not indicate support for a budget that spent trillions more than the Obama budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The debt increased by 100% under President Obama, not 23%. The debt increased from $10.6 trillion to $19.9 trillion during his presidency, which is a 90% increase. The claim also incorrectly states that this was less than under any president going back to Ronald Reagan. In fact, the debt increased by 100% under George W. Bush and by 100% under Ronald Reagan.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you spent only $36.29 on your campaign for governor is highly unlikely. Campaigns for governor, especially in the United States, typically involve significant expenditures. The $36.29 figure is suspiciously low for such a campaign, which usually involves large sums of money for advertising, staff salaries, travel, and other expenses. Therefore, this claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the number of terrorists has doubled is not supported by reliable data or sources.

"Explanation: Medical cannabis oil, like other forms of cannabis, contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the compound responsible for the psychoactive effects.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion a year in Florida, and that this amounts to $700 for every household in Florida, is based on a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). However, the methodology and assumptions used in this study have been criticized by other researchers and organizations. The study's calculations are not universally accepted, and the actual costs of illegal immigration are subject to debate. Therefore, the claim cannot be considered definitively true without further verification and context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The bill in question, known as the Continuing Resolution (CR), did not include funding for Planned Parenthood. However, it did not explicitly defund Planned Parenthood either. The claim is misleading because it suggests that there is no money for Planned Parenthood in the bill, which is not accurate as the bill did not address funding for Planned Parenthood at all.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank is true. The Export-Import Bank of the United States is a government-owned bank that provides financing to U.S. exporters. It was reauthorized in 2018 by the U.S. Congress, extending its authorization until 2022.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""We already have $23 billion worth of debt"" is not specific enough to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. The term ""we"" is ambiguous and could refer to a country, a company, or an individual. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time period or the entity to which the debt belongs. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of this claim without more information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require industry approval before issuing a recall. Once the source of a contamination is identified, the FDA can issue a recall immediately to protect public health. The process of recalling products is governed by regulations and procedures that do not involve waiting for industry approval.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the private sector has invested more than double the amount invested by the public sector at Quonset Business Park.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wall Street hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a sheet metal worker in Parma or a school teacher in Cleveland is generally true. Hedge fund managers often have access to various tax strategies and deductions that can lower their effective tax rates. For example, they may use complex investment structures, such as partnerships and LLCs, which can provide significant tax advantages. On the other hand, the sheet metal worker and school teacher typically have more straightforward tax situations, with less opportunity for tax avoidance strategies. Therefore, the claim is supported by the general principles of tax law and the different tax treatment of various income sources.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Harry Reid and Senate Democrats only took action on veteran healthcare after news broke about veterans dying due to inadequate care is a simplification of the timeline of events. While it is true that the issue gained significant attention and momentum after reports of veteran deaths, it is not accurate to say that no action was taken before. In fact, there have been ongoing efforts and legislation related to veteran healthcare for many years. The claim also overlooks the broader context of political and legislative processes that involve multiple factors and stakeholders.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Rick Perry, the former Governor of Texas, has publicly stated that he believes in the right of states to secede from the union. However, he has also stated that he does not support secession at this time.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that a Medicaid provision added to the Senate health care reform bill is ""not a special deal for Nebraska"" is false. The provision in question, known as the Nebraska Option, was indeed a special deal for Nebraska. It allowed the state to keep its existing Medicaid program, which was more generous than the standard Medicaid program, and receive federal funding to cover the costs. This provision was included in the bill to secure Nebraska's support for the legislation.

"Explanation: Georgia's gun laws are generally considered to be relatively permissive compared to many other states. However, it is not accurate to say that Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation. Several other states, such as Alaska, Arizona, and Wyoming, have even fewer restrictions on gun ownership and use. Therefore, the claim that Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump required every school in America to let people carry guns into classrooms on his very first day in office is false. While Trump did propose to arm teachers and school staff, he did not mandate that every school must allow people to carry guns into classrooms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is a business advocacy group. The report's findings are often criticized for being overly pessimistic and not accounting for potential economic benefits or job creation in other sectors. The specific figures of 244,000 jobs lost and $1,200 additional cost per family are disputed by many economists and environmental groups. The Chamber of Commerce's reports are often used to argue against environmental regulations, but their methodology and conclusions are not universally accepted.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a Massachusetts governor erasing electronic communications as he left office. This practice is not uncommon among public officials, as it is often done to protect personal privacy and avoid potential misuse of public records. However, the claim does not specify which governor or provide any evidence to support the claim. Therefore, without specific details or evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim's authenticity.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""many states are floundering under crushing deficit spending"" is a generalization that can be misleading.

The executive action, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), was announced by President Obama in November 2014.

However, the pace of recovery can vary depending on the specific economic indicators and sectors being considered. Europe, on the other hand, has also been recovering, but the pace of recovery can differ between countries and regions within Europe. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the U.S. economy is recovering slower than Europe overall, as the recovery rates can be comparable or even faster in some European countries.

"Explanation: The claim states that the building in question is not a mosque but a cultural center with a prayer area. This claim is true because a mosque is a place of worship specifically for Muslims, while a cultural center can be a place for various cultural activities and may include a prayer area for Muslims.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the odds of winning the Monopoly Millionaire instant win game are 1 in 3.27 is false. The odds of winning such games are typically much higher than 1 in 3.27.

Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that the United States had declared war on Islam over 200 years ago and that Thomas Jefferson led the charge is false. The United States has never declared war on Islam as a whole. The Barbary Wars, which were fought in the early 19th century, were conflicts between the United States and the Barbary States (Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli) over piracy and tribute. Thomas Jefferson was involved in these conflicts, but they were not directed against Islam as a religion. The claim misrepresents the historical context and the role of Thomas Jefferson.

The State Department had been providing security upgrades and additional personnel, but the specific requests for more security on the day of the attacks were not denied. The claim is often used to imply that Hillary Clinton was responsible for the attacks, which is not supported by the evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that there has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of a specific city.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Latino population in Texas is indeed growing rapidly, and it is projected to become the largest ethnic group in the state by 2025.

"Explanation: The claim that the only segment in the beer market that is growing is the craft beer segment is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the craft beer segment has been growing significantly in recent years, other segments of the beer market, such as premium and imported beer segments, have also shown growth. Additionally, the overall beer market has been experiencing a steady growth in certain regions, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification of the market trends.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the claim that a $15-an-hour proposal in Cleveland is the most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country is not accurate. While Cleveland has proposed a significant increase in its minimum wage, there are other cities and states that have implemented or proposed even higher minimum wages.

Therefore, the claim that Cleveland's proposal is the most aggressive is not true.

"Explanation: The claim that there are mandatory ultrasounds before abortions is false. While some states in the United States have laws requiring ultrasounds before abortions, these are not mandatory nationwide. The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v.

Therefore, the claim that there are mandatory ultrasounds before abortions is false.

"Explanation: The claim that the intelligence community can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism is false. The U.S. intelligence community, including the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is subject to strict legal and regulatory oversight to prevent the collection of information on law-abiding Americans without a valid legal basis. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and other laws require a specific legal process and probable cause to collect information on U.S. citizens. The collection of business records on law-abiding Americans without a connection to terrorism would violate these laws and regulations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that uncompensated care has gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months of Medicaid expansion in the states that adopted it is not accurate. While Medicaid expansion has been shown to reduce uncompensated care, the 30 percent figure is not supported by reliable data or studies. The actual reduction in uncompensated care varies by state and is typically in the range of 10-20 percent, according to studies by the Commonwealth Fund and other reputable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a generalization and does not provide specific data or examples to support its assertion.

The term ""czar"" is often used to describe high-ranking officials in the executive branch who are appointed by the president. While it is true that Obama appointed a number of czars, the number 45 is not accurate. The actual number of czars appointed by Obama is around 20-25, depending on the source and the definition of ""czar."" Additionally, the claim that these czars replaced elected officials is misleading, as czars are typically appointed to oversee specific policy areas and do not replace elected officials.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida seniors are exempt from losing Medicare Advantage under the federal health care bill is false. The Medicare Advantage program is a part of the Medicare program that provides health coverage through private insurance companies.

The ACA actually expanded Medicare Advantage by providing additional benefits and protections for beneficiaries. Therefore, the claim is false.

Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and can be considered as potentially false.

Voter ID laws can vary in their requirements, such as the types of IDs accepted, the process for obtaining IDs, and the penalties for non-compliance. Without specific details about the bill in question and a comparison with other voter ID laws across the nation, it is not possible to definitively determine if this bill is the most restrictive.

The federal government has provided funding and equipment to local law enforcement agencies through programs like the 1033 Program, which allows the transfer of excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies.

However, if the claim is based on general public perception or specific improvements in the process compared to previous years, it could be considered true.

The district does not rely solely on coal for its electric generation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama is the first president to think he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore is false. While it is true that presidents have the power to enforce or not enforce certain laws, this is not a new concept. Presidents have always had this discretion, and it is a part of the executive branch's role in the U.S. government. The claim is an oversimplification and a misrepresentation of the president's role and the U.S. legal system.

"Explanation: The claim that Charlie Crist ""worked with Acorn"" to give felons voting rights is false. Acorn (Community Organizing and Research Center) is a progressive community organizing group that was active in the 2000s, but it disbanded in 2010.

"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true in many contexts, but not universally true.)"
"Explanation: The claim that Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close is a simplification of a complex political issue. While it is true that Republicans have been reluctant to close certain tax loopholes, especially those that benefit businesses and high-income individuals, it is not accurate to say they refuse to list any tax loophole they are willing to close. There have been instances where Republicans have proposed closing specific loopholes, such as the carried interest loophole, as part of broader tax reform discussions. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the Federal Reserve, as of the first quarter of 2021, the total amount of student loan debt in the United States was approximately $1.7 trillion. This is indeed more than the total credit card debt, which was around $800 billion in the same period.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Marco Rubio has publicly stated that he supports restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences, including those who have served time for non-violent offenses. He has also expressed support for certain gun control measures, but his stance on felons owning guns after serving their time is not as clear-cut as the claim suggests. The claim misrepresents his position on both issues.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. To calculate the time it would take to pay out $1 trillion at a rate of $1 per second, we need to convert $1 trillion to seconds. $1 trillion is equal to 1,000,000,000,000 dollars. At a rate of $1 per second, it would take 1,000,000,000,000 seconds to pay out $1 trillion. To convert seconds to years, we divide by the number of seconds in a year (365.25 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute). This calculation yields approximately 31,709 years, not more than 31,000 years.

"Explanation: The Chevrolet Volt is an electric vehicle (EV) with a gasoline engine for extended range. The vehicle's design and safety features are optimized for the unique characteristics of an EV, which includes the placement of the battery pack and other components.

Therefore, it is not advisable to put a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States imposes a penalty on individuals who do not have health insurance and do not qualify for an exemption. This penalty is calculated as a percentage of the individual's income or a flat dollar amount, whichever is higher. The penalty is not lower than the cost of buying insurance; in fact, it is designed to encourage people to purchase health insurance. The penalty is intended to be a disincentive to avoid the cost of health insurance, not to be lower than the cost of insurance itself.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the government is spending 40 percent more than what it takes in is a simplification of the government's fiscal situation. The U.S. government's spending and revenue are influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, policy decisions, and tax revenues. While it's true that the government's spending can exceed its revenue in certain periods, the claim of a 40 percent overspending is not accurate and is an oversimplification. The actual figures would need to be examined in detail to provide a precise assessment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the biggest contribution behind a decrease in U.S. unemployment was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce is false. The decrease in unemployment is primarily attributed to the economic recovery and job growth, not to people leaving the workforce.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdoses are indeed a significant cause of death in the United States, including New Hampshire.

Therefore, the claim that Congressman Cicilline espoused a sanctuary city while he was the mayor of Providence is false.

"Explanation: The claim that 70 percent of Virginia's Medicaid costs are for seniors in nursing homes is not accurate. According to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, in 2020, about 40% of Medicaid spending in Virginia was for long-term care services, which includes nursing home care. However, this does not mean that 70% of Medicaid costs are specifically for seniors in nursing homes. The claim is an exaggeration and is therefore false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered by a referendum to levy a 1-cent sales tax. This claim is false because the sales tax is intended to cover a significant portion of Atlanta's transportation needs. The 1-cent sales tax is expected to generate approximately $1 billion annually, which is a substantial contribution to the city's transportation infrastructure. Therefore, the claim that it covers less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former U.S. President Barack Obama described Iran as a ""tiny"" country and said it doesn't pose a serious threat is false.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that attorney general candidate Jon Richards stated he would only enforce laws with which he personally agreed. This is a significant and unusual stance for a candidate for attorney general, as the role typically involves enforcing all laws, regardless of personal agreement.

There is no credible source provided to support this claim, and it is not a typical position for a candidate to take.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data shows that Wisconsin has experienced job growth under both Democratic and Republican administrations. According to BLS data, Wisconsin's employment increased by 11.5% from 2011 to 2021, with significant job growth occurring during the Democratic administration of Governor Tony Evers. Therefore, the claim that job creation has been fewer under Republican control is not supported by the data.

As of 2021, Israel's per capita income was approximately $40,000, which is higher than many countries.

"Explanation: President Barack Obama did indeed promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill during his first year in office. However, the bill was not passed during his first year. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2009 was introduced in the Senate in May 2009, but it did not pass. Therefore, the claim that Obama broke his promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill in his first year is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle class and small businesses"" is misleading. In 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which included several tax provisions, but it is not accurate to say that 25 tax cuts were passed. Additionally, the claim does not specify which tax cuts were aimed at the middle class and small businesses, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of that part of the statement.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Iran Nuclear Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The deal does not specify that Iran would be on the side of any country, including Israel, in the event of an attack. The JCPOA is a non-proliferation agreement and does not involve military alliances or commitments.

The debt has been growing due to factors such as increased government spending and lower tax revenues.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Newport Tent company requires a different set of permits for each city or town they work in. This claim is likely false because most businesses, including those that set up tents, typically need similar types of permits (such as a business license, zoning permits, and health department approval) regardless of the location. The specific requirements might vary slightly, but the general process is usually consistent across different jurisdictions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Debbie Jackow will not de-fund the 20/20 land program. However, without specific information about Debbie Jackow's stance on this issue, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim.

"Explanation: The claim states that property taxes are now 18% higher than when Mark Sharpe first took office. To verify this claim, we would need specific data on property tax rates at the time Mark Sharpe took office and the current property tax rates.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a general perception rather than specific data. While there are polls and surveys that suggest a majority of Americans support background checks for gun sales, the exact figure of ""ninety percent"" is not supported by any reliable source.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a bill halting the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases would help stop rising gas prices is false. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates greenhouse gases primarily to address climate change, not to directly control gas prices. Gas prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and domestic production and consumption. Halting the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations would not directly address these factors and thus would not help stop rising gas prices.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the measles vaccine has killed 108 people in the last decade while no one has died of measles is false. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the measles vaccine has a very low risk of serious adverse reactions, and the vast majority of deaths from measles are due to the disease itself, not the vaccine. The claim also misrepresents the actual number of measles-related deaths, which are significantly higher than the number of vaccine-related deaths.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Virginia Department of Transportation, the state has indeed had a surplus in its transportation funds, but the amount and the spending on roads are not as stated in the claim.

"Explanation: The claim that the national debt added up to $75 trillion in 2010 and is on track to hit $99 trillion this year is false. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt is approximately $28 trillion, not $75 trillion. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the debt's growth over time. The debt has indeed increased significantly, but the figures provided are incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim that the majority of the Hispanic population and the growth of the population is U.S.-born is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2019, about 62% of the Hispanic population in the U.S. was foreign-born. While the Hispanic population is growing, the majority of this growth is due to immigration from other countries, not births within the U.S. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""No Bridge to Nowhere could occur"" is false. The term ""Bridge to Nowhere"" is a political term used to describe a project that is not needed or is wasteful.

"Explanation: The claim states that Joe Kyrillos voted against women's healthcare six times. To verify this, I would need to check the voting records of Joe Kyrillos on bills related to women's healthcare.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

"Explanation: The claim that food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama is false. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is the program commonly referred to as food stamps, did increase under Obama, but the increase was not two-and-a-half times. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average monthly benefit per person increased from $125.30 in 2008 to $135.00 in 2016, which is an increase of about 8%. This is not a two-and-a-half times increase.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: President Barack Obama did not make a specific promise to keep a Wisconsin GM plant from closing. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of his administration's efforts to save the auto industry during the 2008 financial crisis. The Obama administration provided loans to GM and Chrysler to help them restructure and avoid bankruptcy, but the specific plant closures were decisions made by the companies themselves, not a result of a broken promise by the president.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that most or all of global warming is due to natural causes is not supported by the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has concluded that it is extremely likely (95% confidence) that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. Natural factors, such as volcanic activity and solar radiation, contribute to climate variability, but they are not sufficient to explain the observed warming trend. Therefore, the claim that the science is in dispute is misleading, as the scientific consensus is clear and well-documented.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz USA announced that it would move its corporate headquarters from New Jersey to Atlanta, Georgia.

"Explanation: The claim that State Department officials directed contracts for the Haitian recovery after the earthquake to friends of the Clintons is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. The U.S. government's response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake was led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other federal agencies, not the State Department. Additionally, there is no evidence that any contracts were awarded to friends of the Clintons.

Additionally, individuals must be of legal drinking age and must follow all park rules and regulations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Tommy Thompson ran Medicare into the ground and brought it nine years closer to bankruptcy is a misrepresentation of his tenure as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. Medicare's financial status is influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in healthcare costs, demographic shifts, and policy decisions. While Thompson's tenure saw some changes in Medicare policy, there is no evidence to support the claim that he directly caused Medicare to be nine years closer to bankruptcy. The claim is misleading and not supported by factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""On new dollar coins, In God We Trust is gone!"" is false. The phrase ""In God We Trust"" has been a part of U.S. currency since 1956 and remains on all U.S. coins and paper money, including the new dollar coins. The design of the coins may have changed, but the inscription ""In God We Trust"" is still present.

"Explanation: The claim that the Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia is false. The Georgia Dome was a sports and entertainment venue in Atlanta, Georgia, which was demolished in 2016. The economic impact of the Georgia Dome was primarily related to its use as a venue for events such as the Super Bowl, the NCAA Final Four, and other major events. However, the claim of a $10 billion economic impact is not supported by credible sources or studies. The actual economic impact of the Georgia Dome was likely much lower.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a common misconception about progressive taxation. In reality, Warren Buffett and other wealthy individuals typically pay a lower effective tax rate than their secretary due to the progressive nature of the tax system. This means that higher-income individuals pay a higher marginal tax rate, but they also benefit from various deductions, credits, and other tax advantages that lower their overall tax burden. The claim suggests that this is unfair, but it is a fundamental aspect of how the tax system is designed to redistribute wealth.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was a United States military policy that prohibited open discussion of sexual orientation in the military. This policy was officially ended in 2011 by the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama. However, the claim does not specify which Western countries have ended their ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policies, and it is not accurate to assume that all Western countries have done so. Therefore, the claim is not specific enough to be considered true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal debt has been increasing, but the relationship between debt and economic growth is complex and cannot be simplified to a direct ratio. The claim suggests a specific ratio ($2.52 borrowed for every $1 of economic growth), which is not accurate. Economic growth and debt are influenced by various factors, including fiscal policy, economic conditions, and monetary policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Keystone XL Pipeline is a proposed oil pipeline that would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States. The term ""earmark"" typically refers to a provision in a bill that directs funds to a specific project or purpose. However, the Keystone XL Pipeline is not an earmark under House rules. The pipeline's approval process involves environmental impact assessments and regulatory reviews, rather than being funded through an earmark.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare is false. While Florida has implemented drug testing for welfare recipients, it is not the first state to do so. Other states such as Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee have also implemented similar policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they are paying now is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""a lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they're gay"" is a misconception. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that prison environments cause individuals to change their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is a complex trait influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and personal experiences, but it is not determined by prison environments. The claim is likely a myth or misinterpretation of the experiences of some individuals who may have come out as LGBTQ+ while in prison, but this does not mean that prison causes this change.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Darryl Glenn, a U.S. Senate candidate from Colorado, has not proposed eliminating the Department of Education or jeopardizing college funding for 320,000 Coloradans. Glenn has stated that he wants to reduce federal control over education and increase local control, but he has not proposed eliminating the Department of Education or putting 320,000 Coloradans' college funding at risk.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the president of the United States will be taking a trip to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day is highly unlikely to be true. Presidential trips abroad are typically planned and budgeted for by the Secret Service and other government agencies, and the costs are usually much lower than the figure stated in the claim. Additionally, the claim does not provide any credible source or context to support the $200 million per day figure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that white people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex issue of wealth distribution. While it is true that certain groups may have disproportionate wealth, the claim of 90 percent is an exaggeration. According to various studies and reports, the wealth distribution varies significantly by country and region. For instance, in the United States, the top 10 percent of wealth holders control about 70 percent of the wealth, but this is not exclusive to white people. The claim also does not account for the diversity within the white population, including those who are not wealthy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 200 consumer laws were destroyed in 2011 when Gov. Scott Walker signed Act 92 is false. Act 92, also known as the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, was a controversial piece of legislation that primarily dealt with collective bargaining rights for public employees. It did not significantly impact consumer laws. The claim of 200 consumer laws being destroyed is a misrepresentation of the actual effects of the legislation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Oregon ranked 25th or 7th from the bottom in percentage of children with untreated decay compared to 32 other states with similar data in 2007. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Oregon Health Authority, or other reputable health organizations that provide data on oral health in children. Without specific data or a reliable source to back up the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ted Kennedy sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Muslims attempted to establish the first Islamic Sharia court inside the United States in the town of Irving, Texas, is false. While there have been discussions and attempts to establish Sharia courts in the United States, the claim that this was the first and specifically in Irving, Texas, is not accurate.

The embargo, also known as the blockade, is a set of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on Cuba, restricting trade and investment between the two countries.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, did not reject legislation to make college loan payments tax deductible. In fact, he signed a bill into law in 2015 that allowed for tax deductions on student loan interest.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) did conduct a survey in 2014, but the results regarding Right-To-Work legislation were not as stated. The survey found that 51% of business executives were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation, not 15%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""almost all"" protesters in Madison are from outside of Wisconsin is an overgeneralization and lacks specific evidence to support it. While it is true that some protesters may be from outside Wisconsin, it is not accurate to say that ""almost all"" are. The composition of protesters can vary greatly depending on the specific event and the location within Wisconsin. Therefore, the claim is not supported by reliable evidence.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The debt ceiling deal in 2011, known as the Budget Control Act, did not only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade. The deal included a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases, but it did not specifically allocate funds to extend the tax cuts. The tax cuts were extended as part of a separate agreement in 2012.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). According to the NCES, in the 2018-2019 school year, rural schools enrolled about 20% of American children, not 40%. However, they did receive about 22% of federal education funding. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, established the direct election of U.S. senators by popular vote. It replaced the previous system where senators were elected by state legislatures.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The actual number of jobs created during Bill Clinton's two terms (1993-2001) was approximately 22.5 million, while during George W.

"Explanation: A government shutdown can indeed disrupt veterans benefits.

This can lead to delays or disruptions in benefits such as disability compensation, pension payments, and healthcare services. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides subsidies for health insurance based on income and family size. However, the subsidy phase-out begins at a certain income level, which is $88,000 for a family of four in 2021. This means that a family of four earning $88,000 or less would qualify for a subsidy, but those earning more would not. Therefore, the claim that a family of four can make up to $88,000 a year and still get a subsidy is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that state workers have not had across-the-board raises in six years is not verifiable without specific data or sources.

The ACA also requires that maternity coverage be included in all health plans sold to individuals and small businesses.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the cost of commuting to New York City via the Port Authority with the income tax paid to the state of New Jersey. The cost of commuting can vary greatly depending on the specific route, time of day, and frequency of travel. Additionally, income tax rates and deductions can also vary significantly. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that commuting costs are always higher than income tax paid. The claim is not supported by specific data or a general rule that applies to all individuals earning under $100,000 a year.

During his tenure, the Republican Party did not gain control of either the New Jersey Senate or the New Jersey General Assembly.

For example, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, a Democrat, also failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body during his term.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Sixty-percent of the state retirees...dont get Social Security"" is false.

"Explanation: The claim states that crime is down across the board and specifically mentions a 10 percent decrease in the most serious crimes. This claim is based on a general statement about crime rates and a specific percentage decrease.

"Explanation: The claim that millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool under the new health care law is a misinterpretation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, also known as Obamacare, was designed to expand access to health insurance, not to force people into a government-run system. The law provides subsidies to help people afford private health insurance plans, and it also expanded Medicaid eligibility. The claim is false because it mischaracterizes the ACA's provisions and intent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Police departments do not typically run advertisements that directly target drug dealers or offer to ""take their competition off the streets for FREE.""

"Explanation: The claim is false. State laws regarding property appraisal and payment can vary, but generally, the appraisal process is used to determine the market value of the property, and the payment amount can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, negotiations, and the specific terms of the sale or transaction. The claim that the state can only pay a certain amount above the appraisal is not accurate as it oversimplifies the process and ignores the flexibility in property transactions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the cost of renting a U-Haul to move from San Francisco to Austin is twice as much as the cost to move from Austin to San Francisco due to a lack of trucks to flee the Golden State. This claim is false because the cost of renting a truck for a move is typically determined by factors such as distance, time of year, and demand, not by the direction of the move. The cost of renting a truck from San Francisco to Austin would be the same as from Austin to San Francisco, assuming the same truck size and rental period.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not doubled its estimate for the cost of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The CBO's initial estimate for the cost of the ACA was $1.1 trillion over 10 years, not $800 billion. The CBO has revised its estimates over time, but the most recent estimates are still in the range of $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion over 10 years, not $1.7 trillion.

The study estimated that wind and solar energy could provide up to 20% of the U.S. energy needs by 2030, not 5%. The study also noted that these renewable energy sources could be cost-competitive with conventional energy sources by that time.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly provide for just compensation when land is taken under eminent domain. Instead, the Fifth Amendment states that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. This means that the government must provide fair compensation to the owner when it takes their property for a public purpose. However, the specific amount of compensation is determined by the courts and can vary based on the circumstances.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the spending on negative ads by Mitt Romney's campaign to the spending by John McCain's campaign during his entire presidential run. As of the time of this analysis, there is no publicly available data that directly supports this claim. Campaign spending data is typically reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and is not always immediately available. Therefore, without specific data from reliable sources, it is not possible to verify the claim.

"Explanation: The claim that for every $10,000 invested in business incubators, up to nearly 70 local jobs are generated, is not supported by reliable data or studies. While business incubators can indeed create jobs, the number of jobs created can vary greatly depending on various factors such as the industry, the specific incubator program, and the local economic conditions. There is no universally accepted figure that states for every $10,000 invested, nearly 70 jobs are generated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true but misleading. While it is accurate that Presidents Harding, Kennedy, and Reagan cut taxes during recessions, the claim that they all produced ""rapid and dramatic economic recoveries"" is an oversimplification. The economic recoveries under these presidents varied in speed and magnitude. Additionally, the claim that Herbert Hoover and Barack Obama did ""the opposite"" is also misleading. Hoover did not cut taxes during the Great Depression, but his policies were not the primary cause of the economic downturn. Obama's stimulus package included tax cuts, but the claim that he did ""the opposite"" of the other presidents is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, which found that the income of the top 1 percent in the United States nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, while the income of the typical family (median income) barely increased. This study has been widely cited and is considered reliable. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that financial conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the president and that the president does not have to have a blind trust is false. The U.S. Constitution and federal laws, such as the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, require the president to disclose their financial interests and may require them to place their assets in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest. This is to ensure that the president's decisions are not influenced by their personal financial interests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding decreased under President Bush is not accurate. In fact, NIH funding increased significantly during his presidency. From 2001 to 2008, the NIH budget increased from $14.9 billion to $28.6 billion, an increase of 85%. This increase was part of a broader trend of increased funding for medical research during the Bush administration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the radiation from new TSA body scanners is equivalent to about three minutes worth of air travel at 30,000 feet is misleading. While it is true that the radiation dose from the TSA body scanners is low, comparing it to air travel at 30,000 feet is not accurate. The radiation dose from air travel at high altitudes is primarily due to cosmic radiation, which is different from the type of radiation used in TSA body scanners. The TSA body scanners use non-ionizing radiation, specifically millimeter waves, which are not the same as the ionizing radiation encountered at high altitudes. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she is raped is a misinterpretation of the concept of ""rape shield laws"" and the body's natural responses to trauma. While it is true that the body can experience physical and psychological responses to trauma, including stress and shock, there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that the body can actively prevent pregnancy in response to rape. The claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the new healthcare law crushes small businesses with billions in penalties is a simplification and an exaggeration. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does impose penalties on businesses that do not provide health insurance to their full-time employees, but these penalties are not applied to all small businesses. The penalties are only applied to businesses with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, the penalties are not billions but are calculated based on the number of full-time employees and the cost of providing health insurance. Furthermore, the ACA also provides tax credits to small businesses to help offset the cost of providing health insurance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that despite having a president who was opposed to abortion, the number of abortions did not decrease. This claim is true because the number of abortions in the United States did not significantly decrease during the presidency of Barack Obama, who was opposed to abortion. The claim is supported by data showing that the number of abortions remained relatively stable during his presidency.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""every school will be negatively impacted if Education Stability Fund is not tapped"" is a generalization that may not hold true for all schools. The impact of not tapping the Education Stability Fund would depend on various factors, including the specific needs and financial situations of individual schools. Some schools might have other funding sources or reserves that could mitigate the impact, while others might be more severely affected. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every school will be negatively impacted.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you were the first member of Congress to call Barack Obama a socialist is false. The term ""socialist"" was used to describe Obama by various political figures and media outlets before you made the claim.

Additionally, the term was used by other political figures and in various media outlets before your claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States sends a billion dollars to foreign countries every day due to its addiction to foreign oil is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate. While the U.S. does import a significant amount of oil, the total cost of these imports is not a billion dollars per day. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average daily cost of oil imports in 2021 was around $100 million, not a billion dollars. Additionally, the U.S. is also a major oil producer and exporter, which helps to balance the trade.

The agreement is part of the broader alliance between the two countries, which includes mutual defense commitments.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is a global terrorist organization that has controlled significant territories in Iraq and Syria at various points in time. While its influence and territory have diminished in recent years, it is still active and has a presence in multiple countries. The claim that it is so small it couldn't fill a Double-A baseball park in Charleston, W. Va., is an exaggeration and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that poor people do not abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group is not accurate. Numerous studies and reports have shown that individuals from lower-income backgrounds are more likely to engage in substance abuse, including drugs. This is often due to a combination of factors such as stress, lack of access to healthcare, and limited education. For instance, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has reported that lower-income individuals are more likely to use and abuse drugs due to the stress and hardships associated with poverty.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: To evaluate the claim that Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth over the year, we need to consider data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis or the U.S. Census Bureau. As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have specific data on personal income growth for Wisconsin compared to other Midwest states for the current year. However, typically, such rankings are based on annual reports and comparisons that are released periodically. Without specific data for the current year, it is not possible to definitively say whether Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Democrats' health care bills would provide ""free health care for illegal immigrants"" is false. While some Democratic proposals have included provisions to expand access to health care for undocumented immigrants, these bills do not provide ""free"" health care for all undocumented immigrants. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other Democratic health care bills typically provide access to health care services through public programs or private insurance, but undocumented immigrants are generally not eligible for these programs without additional legislation. The term ""free"" is misleading as it implies no cost, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the use of E-Verify, a system used to verify the employment eligibility of individuals, increases the likelihood of unfair job denials. However, E-Verify is designed to ensure that employers hire only authorized workers, and it does not inherently increase the chances of unfair denials. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of how E-Verify works and its intended purpose. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is an equal number of scientists who believe global warming is not happening or is not caused by human activities. This is a misrepresentation of the scientific consensus. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, the consensus is that global warming is happening and is primarily caused by human activities. The claim also implies that there is a significant number of scientists who disagree with this consensus, which is not accurate. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that global warming is occurring and is primarily human-induced.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""millions of Americans are paying more and getting less under Obamacare"" is a simplification of a complex issue. While it is true that some people have experienced higher premiums and reduced coverage under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), this is not a universal experience. Many people have benefited from the law, including those who were previously uninsured, those who received subsidies to lower their premiums, and those who gained access to preventive care and essential health benefits. The claim also does not account for the overall impact of the law, which has led to a significant reduction in the uninsured rate and improved access to healthcare for many Americans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: When Barack Obama took office in 2009, the Democratic Party held 257 seats in the House of Representatives and 59 seats in the Senate, which was indeed a significant majority.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is getting his nominees confirmed faster than President George W. Bush was at the same time in his second term is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Democratic Wisconsin state senators rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input is false. The Wisconsin State Senate passed a budget bill in 2009 that included a tax increase, but the process was not as rushed or secretive as the claim suggests. The budget bill was debated and amended over several months, and there were public hearings and input from various stakeholders. The claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While pharmacies do have databases to manage prescription drugs, these databases are not designed to track and manage all prescription drugs across the entire healthcare system. A separate prescription drug database would be beneficial for tracking drug usage, identifying potential drug interactions, and monitoring the effectiveness of treatments on a larger scale. The current pharmacy databases are more focused on inventory management and patient-specific records rather than providing a comprehensive overview of prescription drug usage across the entire population.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did not force people out of their health plans. However, it did require individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty, which led some people to drop their plans.

Therefore, while the ACA did not explicitly force people out of their health plans, it did create circumstances that led some people to change their coverage.

"Explanation: The claim that Damascus disincorporation would produce NO significant tax savings is false. Disincorporation, or the process of a city or town dissolving its corporate status, can indeed lead to significant tax savings.

While federal law does not impose a limit on the number of guns an individual can purchase, there are restrictions on the number of guns that can be purchased in a single transaction. The federal law known as the ""Gun Control Act of 1968"" prohibits the sale of more than one handgun per month to a single buyer. Additionally, there are background check requirements and other regulations that apply to gun purchases.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Studies have shown that voter fraud is non-existent in Texas"" is not accurate. While there have been investigations and reports on voter fraud in Texas, there is no consensus that it is non-existent. In fact, several studies and reports have found instances of voter fraud, including cases of voter impersonation, absentee ballot fraud, and improper registration. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that Jennifer Brunner inherited at least 18 lawsuits when she came into the office due to Ken Blackwell's mismanagement of the 2004 election is false. While there were indeed lawsuits related to the 2004 election, the number of lawsuits and their specific attribution to Blackwell's mismanagement are not accurately stated in the claim. The claim is an exaggeration and lacks specific evidence to support the number of lawsuits and their attribution.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 babies are born deformed every year in this country due to alcoholism during pregnancy is not accurate. While fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a real and serious issue, the number of babies born with these conditions is significantly lower. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the estimated prevalence of FASDs in the United States is about 0.2-1.5 per 1,000 live births. This translates to approximately 2,000-15,000 babies per year, not 300,000.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Vietnam is a single country, not two separate entities. The division into North and South Vietnam was a historical situation that lasted from 1954 to 1975, during the Vietnam War. Since 1975, Vietnam has been a unified country.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that the cost of drug testing in Florida exceeded the savings from denying welfare benefits to those who tested positive. However, this claim is not supported by specific data or studies that directly compare the costs of drug testing with the savings from denying benefits. Without concrete evidence, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the voting records of two different individuals, which is not directly verifiable without specific context or data. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific time period and both individuals are serving in Congress, it is possible to verify the accuracy of the claim by checking their voting records from a reliable source such as the official website of the U.S. Congress or a reputable fact-checking website.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without additional context.)"
"Explanation: The claim is made by Hillary Clinton, who served as the Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, her approval ratings varied, but they were generally high. According to Gallup polls, her approval rating was around 60% in 2010 and 2011, and it remained above 50% throughout her term. Therefore, the claim that she had a ""very high"" approval rating is accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that House Republicans spent $50 million on 33 votes to repeal Obamacare is false. The claim is a misinterpretation of a report by the Center for Responsive Politics, which found that the top 33 Republican donors contributed $50 million to the Republican Party in the 2016 election cycle. This does not mean that the money was specifically spent on repealing Obamacare. The claim is a false equivalence and a misrepresentation of the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""Seventy of Ohio's 88 counties now have more than 25 percent of their residents eligible for emergency food.""

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the information given.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that it costs three times more to fight in Afghanistan than in any other place is not accurate. While the cost of operations in Afghanistan has been high due to various factors such as the rugged terrain, the need for extensive security measures, and the ongoing conflict, it is not accurate to say that it is three times more expensive than in other places. The cost of operations in Afghanistan is indeed high, but it is not three times higher than in other conflict zones or areas of operation.

"Explanation: The claim that wind power is already cheaper than fossil fuels in Texas is generally true. According to various studies and reports, the cost of wind power has been decreasing and is now often competitive with or even cheaper than traditional fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. This is due to advancements in technology, economies of scale, and government incentives for renewable energy.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests a correlation between a recent economic uptick and the expectation of a new Republican Congress. However, correlation does not imply causation. Economic trends are influenced by a multitude of factors, including global economic conditions, monetary policy, and domestic economic policies. The expectation of a new Republican Congress could be a factor, but it is not the sole determinant of economic trends. Therefore, the claim is not necessarily true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a multilateral agreement signed in 2015 between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States), and the European Union. The agreement was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The claim that the person was one of the few who voted ""no"" on the Iran deal is not accurate because the deal was not voted on by the U.S. Congress; it was a multilateral agreement negotiated by the Obama administration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to a specific individual named Kirk, but it does not provide any specific details or sources to support the claim that he violated Pentagon rules twice for improperly mingling politics with his military service.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Oregon has never before tried to create a land-use plan for what it should look like for 50 years is false. Oregon has indeed implemented land-use planning, including long-term plans. The Oregon Land Use Act of 1973 established a system of land-use planning that includes comprehensive plans, which are designed to guide the development of the state over a 20-year period. While the specific 50-year timeframe mentioned in the claim is not accurate, the state has a history of creating and updating land-use plans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""On expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act"" is true. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes provisions to expand Medicaid eligibility to more low-income individuals and families. This expansion was intended to provide health insurance coverage to more people who might not otherwise have access to it.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries is a misinterpretation of a study conducted by the Institute of Medicine in 1999. The study found that medical errors, including those that result in death, occur in about 98,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States. This figure does not represent the number of deaths directly caused by botched surgeries but rather the total number of deaths due to medical errors. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The White House did not brand the memorial service for the Tucson shootings with a ""Together We Thrive"" logo and slogan. The event was held in 2011, and the official branding and themes used were related to the event's purpose and the victims, not a specific logo or slogan like ""Together We Thrive.""

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that taxes will have been cut by $4.7 billion in the state by the end of the current budget.

Tax cuts are typically announced and detailed in official budget documents, and such information would be necessary to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote a letter of resignation to the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy is false. Eisenhower was not involved in the planning or execution of the Normandy landings, which were primarily the responsibility of General Bernard Montgomery and other Allied commanders. Additionally, Eisenhower did not resign after the landings; he continued to serve as the Supreme Allied Commander and later became the 34th President of the United States.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama ""reversed"" on his commitment ""to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately"" is false. During his presidency, Obama did indeed announce a timeline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, but the timeline was not immediate. The withdrawal process began in 2009 and was completed in 2011, with the last U.S. troops leaving Iraq in December 2011. Therefore, the claim that he reversed his commitment to immediate withdrawal is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Center for Immigration Studies, which is a think tank known for its conservative views on immigration. The study, titled ""Criminal Alien Convictions in the United States, 2008-2014,"" found that criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, and New York during that period. However, it's important to note that the term ""criminal alien"" is often used to refer to undocumented immigrants, and the study's methodology and data sources have been criticized by some for not accurately representing the full picture of immigration-related crime. Additionally, the study's findings have been disputed by other researchers who argue that the data is misleading and that the percentage of criminal aliens is actually lower.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
"Explanation: The claim that repealing Obamacare saves our nation more than $2 trillion is false. The $2 trillion figure is often cited in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare's overall cost, but it does not represent savings from repealing the law. The repeal of Obamacare would likely result in increased costs for many Americans due to the loss of subsidies and protections for pre-existing conditions. The $2 trillion figure is more accurately associated with the total cost of the ACA over its lifetime, not with savings from repealing it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no constitutional amendment that bans drilling off Florida's coast. The U.S. Constitution does not have provisions that specifically address offshore drilling. Instead, the regulation of offshore drilling is governed by federal laws and regulations, such as the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The ban on drilling off Florida's coast is a result of executive orders and policies, not a constitutional amendment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, the words ""al-Qaida"" were indeed used. The claim that these words were never used in the address is incorrect. Additionally, the claim that this is the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001 is also false, as the words ""al-Qaida"" were used in previous State of the Union addresses.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: John McCain, a Republican Senator from Arizona, was known for his conservative views on economic issues. He did vote against several minimum-wage increase bills during his time in the Senate. However, the claim that he voted 19 times against a minimum-wage increase is not accurate. According to records, he voted against a minimum-wage increase bill in 2007, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he voted against it 19 times.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that only four Texas legislators voted against a law giving in-state tuition rates to certain illegal immigrants. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that only four legislators voted against the law. In fact, the law in question, SB 175, was passed with a majority vote, and the number of legislators who voted against it was more than four. The specific details of the vote can be verified through official legislative records.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Oregon is indeed highly dependent on trade, with a significant portion of its economy driven by exports. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Oregon's exports accounted for 19.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, which is one of the highest percentages among U.S. states. This makes Oregon one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misunderstanding of federal tax revenue and spending. New Jersey and Kentucky, like all states, receive federal funds for various programs, but this does not mean they are getting back more than they send. The federal government collects taxes from all states and uses these funds to provide services and benefits to all Americans. The claim that New Jersey gets 61 cents back for every dollar sent to Washington and Kentucky gets $1.51 back is incorrect and misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everyone's jobs, including low-income African-Americans, is false. Hillary Clinton has not proposed such a policy. She has, however, supported comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but this does not involve instant work permits for millions of new immigrants. Additionally, the claim that this would take jobs from low-income African-Americans is a common misconception and not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States spends $12,000 per child per year in the school system is not accurate. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average expenditure per student in the United States in 2019 was approximately $12,635. However, this figure includes all levels of education (elementary, secondary, and post-secondary) and is not specific to a single year. The claim also uses the term ""a kid,"" which is informal and not typically used in official or academic contexts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor"" is a statement that cannot be objectively verified without additional context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's statements about Muslims are used to recruit fighters by terrorist groups is a complex issue. While it is true that some extremist groups may use political rhetoric to recruit, it is not accurate to attribute all recruitment efforts to specific statements made by a particular individual. The recruitment strategies of terrorist groups are multifaceted and often involve a combination of ideological, religious, and social factors. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that Trump's statements are directly used for recruitment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 U.S. presidential election. However, Christie was not the first governor to endorse Romney. Other governors, such as John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Perry of Texas, also endorsed Romney before Christie.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Bob Graham missing a significant percentage of their votes in 2004 and 2008 is false. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of voting records. In reality, these figures are often misrepresented or exaggerated. For instance, the claim that Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes in 2008 is incorrect. Similarly, the claims about Kerry and Graham are also inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Texans eat more catfish than residents of all other states combined is false. While Texas does have a significant catfish industry and is one of the top producers of catfish in the United States, it is not accurate to say that Texans consume more catfish than residents of all other states combined. Catfish consumption varies widely across the country, and it is not accurate to attribute the majority of catfish consumption to Texas alone.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other climate agencies have reported that 2014 was not the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded. In fact, 2015 and 2016 were both warmer than 2014 in terms of global temperature.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has indeed expanded health coverage to millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. However, the claim that it has ""saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans"" is not supported by specific data or studies. While the ACA has undoubtedly improved access to healthcare, the exact number of lives saved due to the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions is not quantified in a way that can be attributed to the ACA alone.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the New Jersey Department of Personnel, the number of state employees has been fluctuating over the years, but it has not decreased to the level it was when Christie Whitman left office in 2001. In fact, the number of state employees has generally increased since then.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Senate Republican education plan is an unfunded mandate for local school districts is based on the idea that the plan requires school districts to implement certain policies or programs without providing sufficient funding to cover the costs. However, the actual funding provisions of the plan would need to be examined to determine if it is indeed an unfunded mandate. Without specific details about the funding mechanisms and the extent to which the plan requires local districts to cover costs, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate, has indeed made statements about the economy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories"" is not accurate.

This claim is an exaggeration and not supported by reliable data.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Congressman John Lewis did not make allegations that Sarah Palin and Donald Trump were associated with the worst chapter in American history. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of Lewis' statements. Additionally, Senator Obama did not make any remarks about the association of Sarah Palin and Donald Trump with the worst chapter in American history.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The national debt is indeed a significant figure, but it is not accurate to say that it is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household. The national debt is approximately $28 trillion as of 2021, and the U.S. population is around 331 million. Dividing the debt by the population gives a figure of about $84,600 per person, not $48,700. Similarly, the U.S. has about 128 million households, so dividing the debt by the number of households gives a figure of about $218,000 per household, not $128,300. The claim also incorrectly states that the national debt is equivalent to the size of the entire economy. The U.S. economy is much larger than the national debt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the House of Representatives voted to remove the word ""lunatic"" from federal law is false. The term ""lunatic"" is not used in federal law and has not been a subject of recent legislative action.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the state's budget shortfall is not that much different than it was in 2003 cannot be accurately evaluated without specific data or context. Budget shortfalls can vary significantly from year to year due to numerous factors such as economic conditions, tax revenues, and spending priorities. Without concrete figures or a comparison of the actual shortfalls for the respective years, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific time period (2011-13) and a specific group (school districts). To verify the claim, one would need to look at data from that specific time period and group. Without access to such data, it's impossible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, if the claim is based on a reliable source and the data supports it, then the claim could be considered true.

Answer: 0/1 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The ACA expanded healthcare coverage to millions of Americans, including many in Florida. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of 2021, about 11.4 million Americans in Florida were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) due to the ACA. However, the claim of ""thirty million Americans"" is an exaggeration. The actual number of Americans who gained coverage due to the ACA is around 20 million.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
"Explanation: The claim that there is only one candidate under investigation, Terry McAuliffe, is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has not been focusing on the fact that 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of data related to traffic patterns or vehicle occupancy rates. TxDOT's focus is typically on infrastructure maintenance, traffic management, and safety, not on the specific occupancy rates of vehicles.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go when the restrictions of the Iran nuclear deal expire is false. The Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), includes strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure Iran's nuclear activities remain peaceful. Once the restrictions expire, Iran will still be subject to international inspections and monitoring to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. The claim overstates the immediate threat and ignores the ongoing oversight mechanisms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that sixty percent of auto thefts in St. Petersburg are caused by people leaving their keys in the car is not supported by reliable data or statistics. While it is true that leaving keys in the car can be a factor in thefts, it is unlikely that such a high percentage of thefts are attributed to this specific cause. The actual percentage of thefts due to keys left in the car would likely be much lower.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) is a measure of the proportion of the population that is either employed or actively seeking employment. The LFPR has been declining since the 1990s, and it was at 67.3% when Barack Obama became president in 2009. As of 2021, the LFPR is around 61.7%. If the LFPR were to remain at the 2009 level, the unemployment rate would not necessarily be 11%. The unemployment rate is influenced by various factors, including the size of the labor force, the number of job openings, and the number of people actively seeking work. Therefore, the claim that the unemployment rate would be 11% if the LFPR were the same as when Obama became president is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010 is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), there was indeed a significant increase in the number of 501(c)(4) applications in 2010. This surge was largely attributed to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the subsequent political activity surrounding it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Hurricane Katrina occurred in August 2005, and the U.S. Congress did pass a $60 billion relief package in September 2005. However, Superstorm Sandy occurred in October 2012, and the U.S. Congress did not pass a $60 billion relief package for Sandy. The claim is misleading by suggesting that no relief package was passed for Sandy, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama's budget did not propose an Army with fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Army's size has fluctuated over time, but it is not accurate to say that Obama's budget proposed a reduction to the level of personnel before Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Army's size has been influenced by various factors, including the needs of the military and the political climate, but it is not accurate to make the claim as stated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the extra point is almost automatic and provides a specific statistic: ""The NFL had five missed extra points this year out of 1,200 some odd attempts."" This claim is false because it misrepresents the frequency of missed extra points. The NFL has a high success rate for extra points, and five missed attempts out of 1,200 is a very low number, indicating that extra points are indeed quite automatic.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""under his tax plan, no matter where you are in the stratosphere, you're going to be getting a tax cut"" is a generalization that is not specific to any particular tax plan or individual. Tax plans can vary greatly depending on the specific provisions and the income levels they target. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say that everyone will receive a tax cut under any given tax plan without more specific information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Texas has indeed been waiting for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to create insurance opportunities for the uninsured. In 2020, Texas submitted a waiver request to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to allow the state to create a reinsurance program to help lower premiums for individuals and small businesses. This proposal was part of a broader effort to address the state's high uninsured rate. As of my last update in October 2023, the federal government has not yet approved this proposal.

Answer: 1"

Without specific details or a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that John McCain voted against funding the troops because of a timeline in it to draw down American troops is false. John McCain was a strong supporter of the military and was known for his hawkish stance on foreign policy. He voted against the 2008 Defense Authorization Act because he believed it did not provide enough funding for the troops and did not address the issue of the troop surge in Iraq. He did not vote against funding the troops due to a timeline to draw down American troops.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there was a ""massive landslide victory"" in the Electoral College is false. The Electoral College is a process where each state's electoral votes are allocated based on the popular vote in that state. A ""landslide victory"" typically refers to a significant margin of victory in the popular vote, not the Electoral College. In the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, Joe Biden won the popular vote by a significant margin, but the Electoral College vote was much closer, with Biden winning 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 232.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a new bill was written into the new healthcare reform initiative ensuring that Congress will be 100 percent exempt is false. There is no such bill or provision that has been publicly disclosed or confirmed by credible sources. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and subsequent healthcare reform initiatives do not provide Congress with 100 percent exemption from the healthcare system. In fact, members of Congress are required to participate in the same healthcare system as the general public.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that over 14,000 registered voters lost their vote in 2008 due to voting in the wrong precinct is false. While it is true that voting in the wrong precinct can result in a lost vote, the number of 14,000 is not accurate. The actual number of votes lost due to incorrect precinct voting in 2008 was much lower. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not based on accurate information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the form students fill out to get college financial aid is ""longer than the form to get U.S. citizenship"" is false. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is used to apply for college financial aid, is typically shorter and simpler than the U.S. citizenship application form, which is known as the N-400 form. The N-400 form is significantly longer and more complex due to the detailed requirements for naturalization.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is not verifiable with the information provided. It is a subjective statement that cannot be objectively proven or disproven without additional context or data. The claim does not specify the time period, the type of bills, or the definition of ""all the Democrats combined,"" making it impossible to accurately assess its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. As of the latest available data, Newt Gingrich has not raised as much money as Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee combined.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a person has bipartisan support, including 53 sheriffs throughout the state, from both Democrats and Republicans. However, without specific evidence or sources to verify this claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy. Bipartisan support from 53 sheriffs is a significant claim and would typically be backed by concrete evidence such as endorsements, statements, or official records. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, the uninsured rate in Texas was 17.9%, which is indeed higher than the national average of 8.9%. However, the claim that ""one in four Texans lacks health insurance"" is an exaggeration. The correct figure is approximately 17.9%, not 25%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On repeal and replace of federal health care reform"" is incomplete and lacks specific details. It does not provide enough information to determine its truthfulness. The term ""repeal and replace"" is often used in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but without specifying what is being repealed and replaced, it is impossible to evaluate the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the real unemployment rate is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent is false. The official unemployment rate reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is 5.6% as of the latest data. The claim that the real unemployment rate is much higher is a common misconception, often based on misunderstandings of the official unemployment rate or the inclusion of discouraged workers and those who are underemployed. The BLS's official unemployment rate is calculated using a specific methodology that does not include all potential workers who are not in the labor force.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Florida's voting law does not require voter registrations to be turned in within 48 hours.

"Explanation: The claim that Portland has higher standards than federal guidelines on police use of force is not accurate. Federal guidelines, such as those established by the Department of Justice, provide a framework for police use of force that is generally considered to be the standard across the United States. Portland, like other cities, must adhere to these federal guidelines. While local policies may have additional or more stringent requirements, they do not supersede federal standards.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a National Football League (NFL) lockout would cost Atlanta $160 million in lost jobs and revenue is not verifiable with the information provided. The impact of a lockout on a specific city's economy, including job losses and revenue, would depend on various factors such as the city's dependence on the NFL, the number of jobs directly and indirectly related to the NFL, and the economic conditions of the city. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rates for different racial and ethnic groups can vary. As of the latest data, the unemployment rate for Latinos (Hispanic or Latino) is typically higher than the unemployment rate for whites, and the unemployment rate for blacks is often higher than that for Latinos. Therefore, the claim that the Latino unemployment rate is higher than the white rate and the black rate is higher than the Latino rate is true.

"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no bill backed by Sean Duffy or other House Republicans that requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to conduct audits of rape victims who get an abortion.

The bill is not related to the IRS auditing rape victims.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor is a simplification of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While the ACA does introduce certain regulations and requirements for health insurance providers, it does not directly place the federal government between patients and their doctors. Instead, it aims to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health insurance and that insurance companies cannot deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The claim is misleading and oversimplifies the complex nature of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. The ACA has been widely studied and its impact on employment has been a subject of debate. Some studies suggest that the ACA may have led to a reduction in full-time employment, particularly among low-wage workers, due to the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees. However, these effects are not universally agreed upon and are often debated. The claim that the ACA will be the ""biggest job-killer ever"" is an exaggeration and not supported by the majority of evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the cost to implement Florida's class size amendment has been ""$16 billion"" is false. The Florida class size amendment, which was passed in 2002, aimed to reduce class sizes in public schools. However, the total cost of implementing this amendment has been estimated to be around $1.5 billion, not $16 billion. This misinformation likely arises from confusion with the overall cost of education in Florida or other large-scale educational initiatives.

"Explanation: The claim that Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table of abandoning the dollar for a multinational currency is false. Timothy Geithner, who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from 2009 to 2013, never publicly proposed or discussed the idea of abandoning the U.S. dollar for a multinational currency. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his views on international monetary policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Martin Heinrich spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas is false. The CARES Act, which was passed in March 2020, included a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to help businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds were allocated to various programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, and direct payments to individuals. The claim that the funds were spent on failed companies and jobs overseas is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that FCAT (Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test) tests account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year is false. FCAT tests are a significant part of the instructional time in Florida schools, as they are used to assess students' performance in various subjects and are a requirement for graduation. The actual percentage of instructional time dedicated to FCAT tests is not less than 1 percent but is a significant portion of the school year.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning is false. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, included a provision that required indoor tanning services to be treated as a medical service, which led to an increase in the cost of tanning services. However, this was not a 10 percent tax on tanning but rather a requirement for tanning services to be treated as a medical service, which increased the cost of these services.

"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not own 60 percent of GM, nor did his union buddies own almost 20 percent. The U.S. government, through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), owned approximately 61% of GM's shares at its peak, but this was a temporary investment to stabilize the company during the financial crisis. The government sold its shares in GM in 2013, and the union's ownership was not a significant part of the GM's equity structure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that gas prices have doubled because of Obama's policies is misleading and inaccurate. Gas prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and market speculation. The claim that Obama's policies directly caused gas prices to double is not supported by evidence. Additionally, the claim that Obama gave millions of tax dollars to Solyndra and blocked the Keystone pipeline is true, but these actions do not directly correlate to the doubling of gas prices. The Keystone pipeline was blocked due to environmental concerns, and Solyndra's bankruptcy was a result of market conditions and not a direct consequence of Obama's policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, California's credit rating is not the worst in the country. California has a credit rating of AA- from Moody's, which is considered investment-grade. The state with the lowest credit rating in the U.S. is Illinois, which has a rating of BBB- from Moody's. Therefore, the claim that California has the worst credit rating in the country is false.

Therefore, the claim that Lee Leffingwell has been mayor of Austin, Texas for about as long as Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The unemployment rates in Ferguson, Missouri, are not directly attributable to President Barack Obama's policies.

Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that the black unemployment rate is three times higher than the white unemployment rate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) does not have the authority to prevent a company from building a factory in a state based on its labor laws. The NLRB's jurisdiction is limited to enforcing the National Labor Relations Act, which deals with labor relations and collective bargaining, not the specific labor laws of a state. South Carolina's right-to-work law does not prevent Boeing from building a factory there, as it is a matter of state law, not federal law.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of deaths from gun violence in the United States to the number of deaths in the Afghanistan conflict. According to the Gun Violence Archive, as of 2021, there were approximately 24,000 deaths from gun violence in the United States. In contrast, the number of U.S. military and contractor deaths in Afghanistan, as of 2021, was around 2,400. Therefore, the claim that more people have died at the end of a gun in the U.S. since Newtown than we have lost in Afghanistan is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Trump Winery near Charlottesville, Va. is the largest winery on the East Coast is false. The Trump Winery is a small, family-owned winery that produces a limited amount of wine. It is not the largest winery on the East Coast. The largest winery on the East Coast is the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Washington, which has a much larger production and more extensive vineyards.

"Explanation: The claim that the national debt is on track to exceed the size of the entire economy in just two more years is an exaggeration. While the national debt is indeed growing, it is not expected to exceed the size of the economy in such a short period. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the national debt is projected to reach 102% of GDP by 2023, but this is not expected to happen in just two years. The claim is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Powell Butte water reservoir was not necessary and that the money spent on its construction could have been saved. However, this claim is not supported by evidence or context. The decision to build the reservoir was likely based on a need for water supply, which is a critical infrastructure requirement. Without specific evidence or data to support the claim that the reservoir was unnecessary, it is not possible to verify its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to the concept of ""underemployment"" or ""hidden unemployment,"" which includes people who are struggling to find work, have stopped looking, or are working part-time but want full-time work. The official unemployment rate, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, is based on a specific methodology that does not include these groups. The BLS defines unemployment as ""the number of people who are jobless, actively seeking work, and available to take a job."" Therefore, the claim that the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent when considering all people struggling for work or have just stopped looking is not accurate based on the official definition and methodology.

"Explanation: The claim that a congressional laundry closed due to the partial government shutdown is false.

Without specific data and context, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional information.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Amendment 4 in Florida, which was passed in 2018, does not have a local version that would specifically apply to St. Pete Beach. The amendment is a state-wide law that allows for the restoration of voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences and paid all fines and fees. There is no evidence to suggest that St. Pete Beach taxpayers have had to pay hundreds of thousands in legal bills due to a local version of Amendment 4.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders have entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope is not accurate.

"Explanation: The Capitol rotunda was designed by Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Henry Latrobe in the early 19th century. Its primary purpose was to serve as a grand entrance and a central gathering space for the U.S. Congress. While it has been used for various events, including protests, its original design was not intended to specifically accommodate protests. The claim that the rotunda was made to invite the people in and to accommodate protests is a misinterpretation of its historical context.

"Explanation: The claim that over 214,000 doctors have opted out of Obamacare exchanges is false. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as of 2021, there were approximately 100,000 physicians participating in the exchanges. The number of physicians participating in the exchanges has been declining, but the claim of over 214,000 doctors opting out is an exaggeration.

For example, France has a corporate tax rate of 25%, and Germany has a rate of 29.9%. Therefore, the U.S. does not have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""a legacy of taxing and borrowing crippled the economy we inherited two years ago"" is subjective and depends on the specific context and definitions of ""crippled"" and ""two years ago."" Without specific data or context, it's difficult to definitively judge the claim as true or false. However, if we consider the general economic conditions and fiscal policies of the past two years, it's possible to infer that excessive taxing and borrowing could have had negative impacts on the economy.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Charlie Crist, who served as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011, did not veto $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida.

Bush during his presidency, there is no evidence to suggest that he has plagiarized any of George W. Bush's policies or statements. The claim seems to be a mischaracterization or a misinterpretation of political rhetoric.

"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump said ""all Mexicans are rapists"" is a misrepresentation of his actual statement. In a 2015 speech, Trump said, ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" This statement was widely criticized for its generalization and stereotyping. Therefore, the claim that he said ""all Mexicans are rapists"" is false.

"Explanation: The claim that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama in 2008 is false. While unions did contribute significantly to Obama's campaign, the total amount was not $400 million.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the 2007-09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion, which cost every man, woman, and child in the state an extra $310. To verify this claim, we need to check the accuracy of the tax hike amount and the per capita cost.

The claim does not provide a source or reference to support the $1.8 billion tax hike figure or the $310 per capita cost. Without a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of these numbers. Therefore, the claim cannot be independently verified as true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without a reliable source.)"

To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the proposed raises with the compensation of city councils in other communities of similar size. If the proposed raises align with the average or median compensation of city councils in similar-sized communities, the claim is true. If not, the claim is false.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true if the proposed raises align with the compensation of city councils in other similarly sized communities.)"
"Explanation: The claim is true. While the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 was a significant nuclear incident, it did not result in any deaths.

"Explanation: The claim that Obama spent ""40 percent of the PAC money, 43 percent to be exact, on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians"" is false. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of data. The actual spending by Obama's campaign on these states was not 40% or 43% of his PAC money. The claim is likely a result of a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the data.

"Explanation: The claim that ""illegal immigration is not actually getting worse"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While it's true that the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border has fluctuated over time, the overall trend has been an increase in illegal immigration attempts. For instance, the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border has been increasing since 2017, with a significant spike in 2021. Therefore, the claim that illegal immigration is not getting worse is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of events: apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border and births in Texas. While it is true that a significant number of people are apprehended at the border each week, the number of births in Texas is also substantial. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the state has an average of about 10,000 births per week. The number of apprehensions at the border can vary, but it is typically in the tens of thousands per week. Therefore, the claim that more people are apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border a week than are born in Texas each week is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there was a steady reduction in U.S. debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for more than 30 years after World War II is false. While it is true that the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio decreased in the 1950s and 1960s, it has been increasing since the 1970s and has been consistently above 100% since the 1980s.

Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law in 1935, it was designed to provide benefits to a wide range of Americans, not just widows and orphans.

Similarly, Medicare, which was established in 1965, was not a small program but a significant expansion of the Social Security system to provide health insurance for the elderly.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to the U.S. federal budget deficit, which is the difference between the government's spending and its revenue. In 2021, the U.S. federal budget deficit was indeed on track to top $1 trillion. This was due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's response to it, including the passage of the CARES Act and other stimulus packages. Therefore, the claim is true.

Therefore, the claim that she refuses to testify is false.

He was released in 2009, but this was due to a lack of evidence to keep him in custody, not because of any action by President Obama. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has historically opposed expanded background checks for gun purchases.

"Explanation: The claim that you have gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party is false. The claim is made by Donald Trump, who has indeed won the Republican primaries in 2016 and 2020.

"Explanation: The claim that when the New Hampshire Legislature raised the gasoline tax, gas prices in the state were skyrocketing is not accurate. While it is true that the gasoline tax was raised, the claim that gas prices skyrocketed is an exaggeration.

The claim is misleading and does not accurately reflect the relationship between the tax increase and gas prices.

"Explanation: The claim that there has been bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives for the repeal of Obamacare, getting rid of cap and trade, and building the Keystone Pipeline is misleading. While there have been attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) with bipartisan support, the repeal efforts have not been successful. Additionally, there has been bipartisan support for the Keystone Pipeline, but the claim that there has been bipartisan support for getting rid of cap and trade is false. Cap and trade is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and it has bipartisan support in some forms, but the claim that there has been bipartisan support for getting rid of it is an oversimplification.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government has not announced a plan to spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that the wrong precinct rules exacerbate provisional ballot problems and that HB 194 does nothing to solve this issue. However, without specific information about the content of HB 194 and the exact nature of the wrong precinct rules, it is difficult to definitively judge the claim. If HB 194 is intended to address the wrong precinct problem but fails to do so, then the claim would be true. If HB 194 does address the issue, then the claim would be false.

"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower has been widely debunked. Multiple investigations and reports have found no evidence to support this claim. The Trump Organization has stated that all workers were legally employed and had proper documentation. Furthermore, the Trump Tower was built in the 1980s, and the immigration laws and practices were different at that time compared to today's standards.

"Explanation: Sharron Angle, a former U.S. Senator from Nevada, did propose to eliminate the Department of Education during her 2010 Senate campaign. She argued that education should be handled at the state and local levels, and that the federal government should have less involvement. However, this was a campaign promise and not a policy that was implemented during her time in office.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that BP's $20 billion fund to compensate oil spill victims is a ""slush fund"" is false. A slush fund is typically used to describe a fund that is used for discretionary or non-transparent purposes. However, BP's $20 billion fund was established as part of a legal settlement to compensate victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The fund was set up to provide compensation to individuals and businesses affected by the spill, and it was overseen by a court-appointed administrator. Therefore, the fund was not intended for discretionary use and was not a slush fund.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""on in-state tuition for illegal immigrants"" is generally false. In-state tuition is typically reserved for residents of a particular state, and many states have laws that prevent illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition rates. However, some states have policies that allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates, but this is not universal and varies by state. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""the five economic indicators that the federal government tracks - for the first time since August 2006 - were positive this October."" This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that all five economic indicators were positive for the first time since August 2006. Economic indicators such as GDP, employment, and inflation have shown positive trends in recent months, but it is not accurate to say that all five indicators were positive for the first time since August 2006.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing annual deficits under Republican administrations with monthly deficits under Democratic administrations. This is a misleading comparison because annual deficits are typically reported on an annual basis, while monthly deficits are reported on a monthly basis. The claim suggests that the annual deficits under Republicans have somehow become monthly deficits under Democrats, which is not a valid comparison. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a poll shows Democrats are just one point behind Gov. John Kasich without a name attached. However, the claim does not provide any specific details about the poll, such as the source, date, or methodology. Without this information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country is not accurate. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but it is not twice as much as other countries. For example, in 2019, the U.S. spent $10,966 per capita, while countries like Germany and Japan spent around $5,000 per capita. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, established the direct election of U.S. senators by popular vote. It replaced the previous system where senators were elected by state legislatures. Therefore, the claim that ""On repealing the 17th Amendment"" is false because the 17th Amendment has already been ratified and is part of the U.S. Constitution.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the property taxes decreased due to a reduction in the technical college portion of the taxes, which was attributed to state funding. However, without specific details or evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Property tax rates can be influenced by various factors, including local budgets, state funding, and other political decisions. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that minors find it easier to get marijuana than alcohol is not universally supported by studies. While some studies may suggest that minors can more easily access marijuana, others indicate that access to alcohol is also a significant issue. The ease of access to these substances can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, local laws, and enforcement. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that minors find it ""very easy"" to get marijuana compared to alcohol.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump is false. The Keystone XL pipeline was not a significant factor in determining gasoline prices. Gasoline prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global oil supply and demand, refinery capacity, and geopolitical events. The Keystone XL pipeline was one of many proposed projects, and its cancellation did not directly impact gasoline prices at the pump.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has indeed reduced the number of uninsured Americans, but the reduction is not 3 percent for $2 trillion. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the uninsured rate in the U.S. decreased from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2019. The cost of the ACA is estimated to be around $1.2 trillion over 10 years, not $2 trillion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we import more oil today than ever before is not accurate. While global oil consumption has been increasing, the peak of oil imports occurred in the 1970s due to the oil crisis. Since then, oil production and imports have fluctuated, but the overall trend has been a decrease in oil imports as a percentage of total oil consumption. This is due to increased domestic production and the development of alternative energy sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Will Hurd tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record is false. Will Hurd, a former Republican Congressman from Texas, was known for his moderate views and was often critical of his party's leadership. He voted with his party on most issues but was not as consistently conservative as the claim suggests. His voting record was more nuanced and varied, not strictly 96 percent Republican.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Greece is about the size of metropolitan Miami is incorrect. As of 2021, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Greece was approximately $243 billion, while the GDP of Miami-Dade County, which is the metropolitan area of Miami, was around $347 billion. Therefore, Greece is not comparable in size to Miami in terms of economic output.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children"" is a misinterpretation of the national debt. The national debt is the total amount of money the federal government has borrowed to finance its spending. It is not accurate to say that this debt is being borrowed from ""my children"" as it is a collective responsibility of the entire population. The debt is a result of the government's spending and is not directly borrowed from individuals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Cigarette butts are indeed a significant source of litter and can pose a risk to children and pets if ingested. However, the claim that they specifically poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them is misleading. While nicotine is a harmful substance, the primary danger from cigarette butts is the ingestion of the toxic chemicals and tar present in the butts, not the nicotine itself. Additionally, the amount of nicotine in a single cigarette butt is not sufficient to cause poisoning in a child.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, in a press release. The press release provides data from the Georgia Department of Labor, which shows that since Governor Kemp took office in January 2018, there have been 319,000 new private sector jobs created in Georgia, with nearly 93,000 of those coming in the past 12 months.

"Explanation: The claim that President Obama was proposing ""pinprick strikes"" for military intervention in Syria is false. The term ""pinprick strikes"" is not a recognized military strategy and was not used by President Obama or his administration.

"Explanation: The claim is about a change in a political figure's stance on a specific policy. Without specific context or a source, it's difficult to verify the exact nature of the change. However, if the claim is about a public figure's policy shift, it is generally true that politicians can change their positions over time. Therefore, the claim could be true depending on the specific context and the source of the information.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. John Edwards, a former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate, was indeed a strong advocate for universal healthcare during his 2004 presidential campaign. He proposed a plan called ""Healthcare for All Americans,"" which aimed to provide universal healthcare coverage. Therefore, the statement that he wasn't for universal healthcare in 2004 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Multnomah County libraries are open 44 hours per week, which is the lowest of any library in the four-county region.

Without specific data, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Mike Huckabee has indeed appeared in infomercials promoting products and treatments for diabetes.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not released any specific data or reports indicating that its regulation of greenhouse gases will endanger 575 Texas dairy facilities, 58 swine operations, 1,300 corn farms, and 28,000 beef cattle operations. The EPA's regulations on greenhouse gases are aimed at reducing emissions from various sources, including power plants, vehicles, and industrial facilities, but the specific numbers provided in the claim are not supported by any official EPA data or reports.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) is a proposed law that would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment. It does not target or discriminate against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, or the rights of religious freedom. In fact, ENDA is designed to protect individuals from discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, which are protected classes under the law. The claim that ENDA discriminates against religious groups is a misinterpretation of the law's purpose and intent.

"Explanation: South Florida, particularly the Miami-Dade County area, is known for having a higher mosquito population compared to many other regions in the United States. This is due to the warm climate, abundant water sources, and the presence of invasive species like the Asian tiger mosquito. The Florida Department of Health and other local authorities often report higher mosquito activity in this region, which supports the claim.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that the City of Philadelphia and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, there is no evidence to support the claim that crime went down by 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual impact of the investment.

"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island has one of the 10 strictest gun laws among all the states is not accurate. According to the Gun Violence Archive and other sources, Rhode Island has relatively moderate gun laws compared to other states. While it does have some strict regulations, such as a requirement for a permit to purchase a firearm and a ban on certain types of assault weapons, it does not rank among the top 10 states with the strictest gun laws.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 2011 was the worst drought year ever recorded in the region is not accurate. While 2011 was a severe drought year, it is not accurate to say it was the worst ever recorded. Droughts are often measured by their severity, duration, and impact, and there have been other years with more severe droughts in the region. For example, the drought of 1934, known as the Dust Bowl, was one of the most severe droughts in U.S. history and had a significant impact on the region.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""In the 1980s, the lowest income people had the biggest gains"" is false. During the 1980s, there was a significant increase in income inequality in the United States. While the overall economy grew, the gains were not evenly distributed. The top income earners saw substantial increases in their incomes, while the lowest income earners saw little to no increase. This period is often referred to as the ""Great Divergence"" due to the widening gap between the rich and the poor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that for every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps is a misinterpretation of data. The claim is based on a study by the Heritage Foundation, which suggested that for every job created by the stimulus package, 75 people were added to the food stamp rolls. However, this study was criticized for its methodology and the way it interpreted the data. The claim does not accurately reflect the relationship between job creation and food stamp usage during the Obama administration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that solar energy can be efficiently collected and transmitted over long distances. While it is true that the Southwestern desert has high solar radiation, the claim does not account for several factors:
1. **Efficiency of Solar Panels**: Solar panels are not 100% efficient. They typically convert around 15-20% of the sunlight they receive into electricity.
2. **Transmission Losses**: Transmitting electricity over long distances results in significant losses. The claim does not consider the infrastructure needed to transmit this energy efficiently.
3. **Storage and Distribution**: Solar energy is intermittent, requiring storage solutions like batteries. The claim does not address the need for storage and distribution infrastructure.
4. **Geographical Distribution**: The claim assumes that all the energy can be collected and used in one area, ignoring the need for a nationwide grid and distribution system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Bernie Sanders has been a consistent advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, including same-sex marriage, for many years. In 2000, he voted against a bill that would have allowed same-sex couples to marry in Vermont, but he has since changed his stance and has been a strong supporter of same-sex marriage. Therefore, the claim that he was there when it came to same-sex marriage 20 years ago is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as ObamaCare, does not require all persons enrolled in insurance plans to pay an abortion premium. The ACA prohibits federal funds from being used to pay for abortions, but it does not mandate that all insurance plans cover abortions. Additionally, the ACA allows states to opt out of covering abortions in their Medicaid programs. Therefore, the claim that the administration has issued rules for $1 abortions and requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay an abortion premium is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Rick Perry served as the Governor of Texas from 2007 to 2015. Before his political career, he worked as a businessman and ran a family business. Therefore, the claim that he has never held a private-sector job is false.

"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs state taxpayers over $3 billion every year is often cited in political debates but is not supported by comprehensive, widely accepted studies. The $3 billion figure is often derived from a 2017 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which has been criticized for its methodology and bias. Other studies and analyses have found that the economic impact of illegal immigration is more nuanced and often positive, with immigrants contributing to the economy through taxes and labor. Therefore, the claim is not supported by reliable, widely accepted evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a liberal immigration reform group endorsed Dave Brat, a GOP primary opponent.

"Explanation: The claim that welders make more money than philosophers is not universally true. The income of individuals in these professions can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, experience, education, and specific job roles. While welders in certain industries or regions may earn more than philosophers, the reverse can also be true in other contexts. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that welders always make more money than philosophers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Teddy Roosevelt did advocate for health care reform, but the claim that he ""first called for (health care) reform nearly a century ago"" is misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want to raise taxes on all income brackets is a generalization that is not accurate. While both have proposed tax increases on higher income brackets, they have not advocated for raising taxes on all income brackets. Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign platform included proposals to increase the top marginal tax rate and close loopholes for the wealthy, but she did not propose a tax increase for all income brackets. Similarly, Barack Obama's tax policies during his presidency focused on increasing taxes for the wealthy and closing loopholes, but he did not propose a tax increase for all income brackets. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss votes more with Democrats than with conservatives is false. Chambliss is a Republican and has consistently voted with the Republican Party.

This indicates that he is a conservative and votes primarily with his party.

There have been instances in the past where multiple nuclear-powered aircraft carriers have been docked together. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Harry S. Truman, were docked together in the Persian Gulf. Additionally, the U.S. Navy has conducted exercises with multiple carriers in the past, such as the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, where multiple carriers have been present.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not mandate that small businesses adopt a specific health care plan. Instead, it provides options for small businesses to offer health insurance to their employees. The penalty for not offering health insurance to employees is not a fine but a tax on the employer if they have 50 or more full-time equivalent employees and do not offer affordable health insurance. Additionally, the ACA does not apply to businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin has fallen to dead last in Midwest job growth is based on the latest job numbers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans"" is not accurate. While there are varying opinions on cap-and-trade policies, numerous polls and surveys have shown that a significant portion of Americans support or are neutral towards such policies. For instance, a 2021 poll by the Yale Climate Communications program found that 69% of Americans support a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the claim that cap-and-trade is ""wildly unpopular"" is an oversimplification and not supported by data.

While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2010, included provisions aimed at reducing prescription drug costs, such as the closing of the Medicare Part D doughnut hole, the specific claim about reducing costs for 3.6 million Americans in 2011 is not accurate.

The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was established by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system during the 2008 financial crisis. AIG received $182 billion in bailout funds, but the government did not allow AIG to pay bonuses to its executives.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the position of the McCain campaign to that of Vice President Gore's campaign one week before the 2000 election. In 2000, the election was extremely close, with Gore leading in the polls but ultimately losing to George W. Bush. The McCain campaign, on the other hand, was not in a similar position. John McCain was not leading in the polls and was not in a close race with Barack Obama, who ultimately won the 2008 election. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Health care reform: Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care"" is a generalization and an oversimplification. Health care reform can have various impacts depending on the specific policies and measures implemented. Some reforms may indeed increase costs or taxes, but others aim to reduce costs, improve access, and enhance quality. The claim does not provide specific examples or evidence to support its assertions, making it difficult to judge its accuracy without more context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States has spent trillions of dollars since 1965 yet the poverty rate has not budged is misleading. While it is true that the United States has spent significant amounts on various social programs and initiatives aimed at reducing poverty, the poverty rate has indeed fluctuated over time. The poverty rate has decreased in some periods and increased in others, but it has not remained static. For instance, the poverty rate was around 15% in the 1960s, dropped to around 11% in the 1970s, and has fluctuated since then, reaching a low of 11.3% in 2000 and a high of 15.1% in 2010. Therefore, the claim that the poverty rate has not budged is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade is not accurate.

For instance, states like California, Florida, and Texas have also experienced a decline in higher education spending. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that a million people come into the U.S. legally each year is not accurate. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the number of people who obtain lawful permanent resident status (green card) annually is around 1 million, but this includes both new immigrants and those who adjust their status. However, the number of new immigrants (those who are not already in the U.S. and obtain a green card) is significantly lower. The claim that no other country comes close to this figure is also misleading, as many countries have similar or higher numbers of legal immigrants.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush, a Republican, did not expand government health care. Instead, it created a new program called Medicare Part D, which provides prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries.

While the Koch brothers, through their companies, have been involved in various industries that contribute to pollution, such as fossil fuel extraction and manufacturing, they are not among the top polluters in the country.

"Explanation: The claim that Texas is the only state that exempts jet fuel from its state motor fuels tax is false. While Texas does have a unique tax structure for jet fuel, it is not the only state that exempts jet fuel from its motor fuels tax.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Colorado does not have a law that allows residents to print ballots from their home computers and then encourages them to turn ballots over to collectors. Colorado's mail-in voting system does allow residents to request and receive ballots by mail, but the process does not involve printing ballots at home. Additionally, the practice of ""ballot harvesting"" is illegal in Colorado, where it is a felony to collect and submit ballots on behalf of others.

The pipeline has been a subject of controversy and debate, with some supporting its construction for economic reasons and others opposing it due to environmental concerns.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has 77 different means-tested social welfare programs is not accurate. While the federal government does have numerous social welfare programs, the exact number of means-tested programs can vary depending on the source and the definition of ""means-tested."" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 80 means-tested programs, but this number can fluctuate. Therefore, the claim of 77 programs is not precise and can be considered false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The fiscal cliff refers to a series of tax increases and spending cuts that were scheduled to take effect at the beginning of 2013. However, lawmakers did not fail to avert the fiscal cliff. In fact, they passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which averted the fiscal cliff and prevented the automatic spending cuts and tax increases. Therefore, the claim that 18 percent of the federal money sent to the states would be eliminated is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000 in 2011 is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The new Arizona immigration law, known as SB 1070, allows police to stop and check the immigration status of anyone they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" to believe is in the country illegally.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases, is not universally true. While some studies suggest that a minimum wage increase can lead to a small increase in unemployment, particularly among low-skilled workers, other studies find no significant effect or even a positive effect on employment. The impact of a minimum wage increase on employment depends on various factors, including the size of the increase, the industry, and the overall economic conditions. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time the minimum wage is raised, the number of jobless people increases.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law is true. In 1973, the Trump Management Company was sued by the Justice Department for discriminatory housing practices. The company was accused of refusing to rent apartments to African-Americans and other minorities. The case was settled out of court, with the Trump Organization agreeing to pay $1 million in damages and to rent apartments to minorities. This incident is well-documented in various sources, including the New York Times and the Washington Post.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The National Park Service (NPS) is a federal agency in the United States, while the city of Austin is a local government entity.

"Explanation: The claim that Virginia's ban on felons from voting is a Jim Crow-era law is false. The Jim Crow laws were a series of state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. These laws were enacted between 1877 and 1950, and they were designed to disenfranchise and discriminate against African Americans. Virginia's current felon disenfranchisement law, which was passed in 1902, is not a Jim Crow-era law. It was passed before the Jim Crow era and was not intended to target African Americans specifically.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021, about 14% of minimum wage workers were between the ages of 16 and 19, and 25% were between the ages of 20 and 24. This means that a significant portion of minimum wage workers are indeed teenagers or young adults, not just one out of 10.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the national economic recovery and its impact on state tax revenues and budget surpluses. While it is true that many states have experienced economic growth and increased tax revenues, it is not accurate to say that nearly every state has seen higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses. The economic recovery has been uneven, with some states benefiting more than others. Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is made by the Trump family, and it is a statement about their net worth when they moved into the White House. The claim is that they had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman.

The Trump family's net worth was estimated to be around $3.7 billion, while the Truman family's net worth was much lower.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that easing restrictions on selling alcohol on Sundays will result in more traffic crashes and fatalities is based on the assumption that increased alcohol consumption will lead to more impaired driving. While it is true that alcohol consumption can impair judgment and motor skills, leading to an increased risk of traffic crashes and fatalities, the claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that easing restrictions on Sunday alcohol sales will directly cause more crashes and fatalities. The impact of such a policy change would depend on various factors, including the current alcohol consumption patterns, enforcement of drunk driving laws, and public awareness campaigns.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Tea Party is not a registered political party in the United States, and therefore, it does not have official polling data like the Republican and Democratic parties. Polling data for political parties typically refers to the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of individuals on death row who have completed all appellate review and are awaiting the governor's signature on a death warrant is not approximately 40.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Proposition 57, also known as the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016, is a California ballot initiative that was passed in 2016. It aims to reduce the state prison population by allowing non-violent, non-serious offenders to be eligible for parole after serving the full term of their primary offense. However, it does not provide any form of immunity or ""get out of jail free"" card for violent crimes such as drive-by shootings or discharging guns on a school yard. These actions are still considered serious crimes and would result in severe penalties, including long jail sentences. Therefore, the claim that Proposition 57 would allow individuals to commit these crimes and ""get out of jail free"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim refers to a group of senators known as the ""Gang of 14,"" which was formed in 2007 to prevent the Senate from becoming gridlocked. The group consisted of seven Republicans and seven Democrats. The claim also mentions that Sen. Obama (Barack Obama) had the opportunity to join this group but chose not to. However, Sen. Obama was not a senator in 2007; he was a senator-elect at the time and was not yet in office. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Nathan Deal has taken at least $15,600 from the Koch brothers, their businesses, and their employees is false. There is no evidence or record of such a transaction.

"Explanation: The claim about a man using bath salts and having raccoons set fire inside his home and steal his cell phone is highly unlikely. Bath salts are a type of drug that can cause hallucinations and paranoia, but they do not cause raccoons to set fires or steal cell phones. Raccoons are not known to use tools or set fires, and they typically do not steal cell phones. This claim appears to be a mix of fact and fiction, with the bath salts and raccoons elements being false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplified calculation that does not account for the fact that Medicare taxes are paid over a lifetime, while benefits are received over a shorter period. The claim also does not consider the fact that Medicare taxes are paid by both the employee and the employer, and that the benefits are not solely for the retiree but also for their spouse and dependents. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that Medicare benefits are not received in a lump sum but are spread out over the retiree's lifetime.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific year (2010) and provides a combined figure for the top 10 CEOs' salaries. However, it does not provide a source or specific data to verify the claim. Additionally, the claim about the average American worker's wage rising by just 2 percent is not directly related to the CEOs' salaries and does not provide a source for this information either. Therefore, without a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population is supported by several studies and reports. For instance, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that law enforcement officers have a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other causes compared to the general population. This increased risk is often attributed to the stress and physical demands of the job, as well as exposure to hazards. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that suicide is caused by a federal government policy of giving people something for nothing is a misinterpretation and a false narrative. Suicide is a complex issue influenced by a multitude of factors, including mental health, socioeconomic status, personal relationships, and individual circumstances. The claim suggests a simplistic and inaccurate cause-and-effect relationship between government policies and suicide rates, which is not supported by evidence or expert consensus.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) does not infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms. The treaty aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, including small arms and light weapons, to prevent their diversion to unauthorized users. It does not restrict the ownership of firearms within a country's borders. The treaty's provisions are designed to promote responsible arms transfers and prevent the proliferation of weapons that could be used in human rights abuses or terrorism. Therefore, the claim that the U.N. Arms Treaty infringes upon the right to keep and bear arms is false.

Therefore, the claim that Newt Gingrich is aligned with Nancy Pelosi on global warming is false.

"Explanation: The claim that Purim is ""their version of Halloween here"" is false. Purim and Halloween are distinct holidays with different origins, traditions, and purposes. Purim is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people in the ancient Persian Empire from a plot to annihilate them. It is celebrated with a public reading of the Book of Esther, giving gifts to the poor, and a festive meal. In contrast, Halloween is a secular holiday that originated in the United States and is celebrated with activities like trick-or-treating, wearing costumes, and decorating with pumpkins and ghosts. While both holidays involve some form of celebration and dressing up, they are not interchangeable or equivalent.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the IRS, in 2019, about 44% of Americans did not pay any federal income tax. However, this does not mean that they do not pay any taxes at all. Many Americans pay other types of taxes, such as payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare), state and local taxes, and property taxes. Additionally, the wealthiest Americans do pay a significant portion of the federal income tax. In 2019, the top 1% of earners paid 40.1% of the total federal income tax collected.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the assets of the six largest banks in the United States over two different time periods. The first part of the claim states that 15 years ago, the assets of the six largest banks totaled 17 percent of GDP. The second part of the claim states that today, the assets of the six largest banks total 63 percent of GDP. These figures are not directly comparable because they are from different time periods and the economic conditions may have changed significantly over those 15 years. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as it stands without additional context or data.

"Explanation: The claim is true.

"Explanation: The claim that the largest category of people coming into technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees is likely false. Technical schools typically attract individuals who are seeking vocational training or have completed high school or some college, rather than those with four-year degrees.

As of 2021, Brazil is the 12th largest oil producer globally and the 10th largest exporter.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not make it unlawful for individuals to not purchase health insurance. The ACA's individual mandate, which required most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, was repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. However, the mandate itself was not deemed unlawful; it was simply repealed. Therefore, there is no law that makes not purchasing health insurance unlawful.

However, the claim that ""buyers can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks"" is misleading. The proposal in question was the ""Manchin-Toomey Amendment,"" which would have expanded background checks to cover gun shows and online sales.

"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While it is accurate that certain areas in the United States, such as Oakland and Ferguson, have higher crime rates compared to other parts of the country, it is an oversimplification to say that these places are among the most dangerous in the world. The claim also does not provide context or data to support the assertion that these places are worse than other dangerous areas globally. Additionally, it is important to note that crime rates can vary significantly within a city, and many areas in these cities are not as dangerous as the overall statistics might suggest.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Bush's tax cuts for high earners have been the biggest contributor to the budget deficit is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the Bush-era tax cuts, particularly those for high earners, did contribute to the budget deficit, they were not the sole or even the primary cause. Other factors, such as increased military spending, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the economic downturn following the 2008 financial crisis, also played significant roles in the growth of the budget deficit during the Bush administration. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely true.

This discrepancy can be attributed to various factors, including the timing of stimulus payments and the implementation of unemployment benefits.

"Explanation: The claim is based on the gender wage gap, which is a well-documented phenomenon. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2020, women in Oregon earned 83.4% of what men earned, which is approximately 79 cents for every dollar paid to men. The claim then uses this figure to calculate the potential benefits if the wage gap were eliminated. The calculations are based on the average cost of gas, food, and rent in Oregon, which are reasonable assumptions. Therefore, the claim is true.

"Explanation: House Bill 2 (HB2), also known as the ""Bathroom Bill,"" was a controversial law passed in North Carolina in 2016. It required individuals to use public restrooms that corresponded to their birth sex, rather than their gender identity. This law was widely criticized for discriminating against transgender individuals and was later repealed in 2017. The claim that ""We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina with the passage of HB2"" is false because HB2 did indeed take away certain rights, specifically the right of transgender individuals to use restrooms that align with their gender identity.

While all three candidates have proposed healthcare reforms, their plans differ significantly. Hillary Clinton's plan, for instance, was to expand the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), while Bernie Sanders proposed a Medicare for All system. Donald Trump's plan involved repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. None of these plans put the government in charge of both the patient and the doctor, as the claim suggests.

"Explanation: The claim that there are 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day is not accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, as of 2021, there are approximately 20 million veterans in the United States. However, the number of veterans who are homeless or on the street at any given time is significantly lower. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that around 40,000 veterans are homeless on any given night. Therefore, the claim that there are 200,000 to 400,000 veterans on the street is an exaggeration.

"Explanation: The claim that Mexico does not have birthright citizenship and that Americans are the only ones to have it is false. Mexico does have birthright citizenship, which means that anyone born in Mexico is automatically a Mexican citizen.

Other countries, including Mexico, also have similar provisions.

The release of oil from the SPR is typically done in response to specific events, such as natural disasters or market disruptions, and is not a routine or ongoing process.

"Explanation: Lyndon B. Johnson's stance on civil rights was complex and evolved over time. While it is true that he initially opposed many civil rights measures during his early years in Congress, he later became a strong advocate for civil rights legislation. In 1957, he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, but by the time he became President in 1963, he had shifted his position and played a crucial role in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Therefore, the claim that he opposed every civil rights measure that came up for a vote during his first 20 years in Congress is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Keystone XL pipeline would employ 20,000 people in the United States is an overestimation. While the pipeline's construction would create jobs, the actual number of jobs created is significantly lower. According to various studies and reports, the Keystone XL pipeline would create around 4,000 to 6,000 jobs during construction, with a smaller number of permanent jobs after completion. Therefore, the claim that it would employ 20,000 people is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, cyclists are required to follow the same traffic rules as motor vehicles.

"Explanation: The claim that the lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less on healthcare is not accurate. According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks 38th in life expectancy at birth, while many countries with lower healthcare spending, such as Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland, rank much higher. Additionally, the U.S. spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but this does not translate to a longer lifespan. The claim oversimplifies the complex relationship between healthcare spending and life expectancy.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for a janitor in New York City was $35,000 in 2020, while the median annual wage for a kindergarten teacher was $55,000. Therefore, the janitor earns less than half of what an entry-level teacher earns.

Research has shown that the benefits of preschool education can last well beyond the fourth grade. For instance, a study published in the journal ""Science"" in 2019 found that children who attended high-quality preschool programs had better academic outcomes and were more likely to graduate from high school and attend college. Another study by the Brookings Institution in 2018 also found that the benefits of preschool education can persist into adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a common misconception about income tax distribution. While it is true that the top 1 percent of income earners often pay a significant portion of income taxes, the statement that those at the bottom pay little or nothing is an oversimplification. Many low-income individuals do not pay income taxes because they have little or no taxable income, but they do pay other taxes such as sales taxes, property taxes, and payroll taxes. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a particular state has more children's hospitals than any other state in the union is not verifiable without specific data. The number of children's hospitals can vary based on population, healthcare needs, and other factors. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say that one state has more children's hospitals than any other without concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that many workers in Malaysia are indentured servants because their passports are taken away and they work in slave-like conditions is a misrepresentation of the situation. While it is true that some workers in Malaysia, particularly those from countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Indonesia, may face exploitation and have their passports held by their employers, this does not constitute indentured servitude. Indentured servitude is a legal term that refers to a contract of labor for a fixed period, often with the promise of freedom upon completion. In Malaysia, while there are issues of exploitation and abuse, the legal status of workers is not that of indentured servants. The claim also oversimplifies the complex issues of labor migration and exploitation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor was called a racist is false. While there have been criticisms and controversies surrounding her statements and rulings, the specific claim that she was called a racist by a particular individual or group is not accurate. The misconception might arise from her comments about the ""wise Latina"" and her views on judicial philosophy, but these comments were not made in the context of being called a racist.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""ninety six percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses"" is not accurate. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, in New Hampshire (the Granite State), approximately 98% of businesses are considered small businesses. This means that the claim is exaggerated and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The tax deduction for charitable donations is the same for everyone, regardless of their income level. The amount of tax deduction is based on the amount donated, not the donor's income. Therefore, both a middle-class family and Bill Gates would receive the same tax deduction for a $1 donation.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: Mitchell International Airport is not the third busiest airport in the world. The third busiest airport in the world is Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the United States. Mitchell International Airport is not even the busiest airport in the country; that title belongs to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, has indeed expressed support for Arizona's immigration law, SB 1070, which requires law enforcement to check the immigration status of individuals they suspect are in the country illegally. However, he has also stated that he believes the law should be implemented in a way that is consistent with the Constitution and that it should not be used to target individuals based on their race or ethnicity. Therefore, while he has supported the law as a model, he has also expressed concerns about its implementation and potential misuse.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that individuals with mental illnesses die an average of 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness is true. This is supported by numerous studies and reports, including a 2014 study published in the journal ""Lancet Psychiatry"" which found that people with mental health conditions die on average 10-20 years earlier than those without. This is often due to a combination of factors including higher rates of physical health conditions, substance abuse, and suicide.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the government, not the armed forces, is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use is false. The U.S. government does not stockpile ammunition for domestic use. The U.S. military, not the government, is responsible for stockpiling ammunition for its own use. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the military's stockpiling activities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Six of Georgia's counties have no lawyers at all"" is false. According to the American Bar Association, as of 2021, there are 159 counties in Georgia, and it is highly unlikely that six of them have no lawyers. While some counties may have a shortage of lawyers, it is not accurate to say that six counties have none at all.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that removing football (soccer) would lead to an increase in crime. This claim is not supported by empirical evidence.

Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or studies to support its assertion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are back on the battlefield is false. The five detainees, who were released in exchange for Bergdahl, have not been reported to have returned to the battlefield. The U.S. government has stated that they are not believed to be involved in any ongoing terrorist activities. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the situation and lacks credible evidence.

"Explanation: Prince William Sound in Alaska has experienced significant environmental impacts due to human activities, including oil spills, logging, and mining. While there are efforts to restore and protect the area, it is not accurate to describe it as ""pristine"" due to these ongoing issues. Therefore, the claim that Prince William Sound is pristine now is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about the language used in bills that the speaker has supported. It is a subjective statement and cannot be objectively verified without specific details about the bills and the language they contain.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: According to the College Board's 2021 SAT report, Georgia ranks 39th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in SAT scores. Additionally, Georgia's graduation rate for the class of 2020 was 83.5%, which is below the national average of 86.1%. Therefore, the claim that Georgia is near the bottom among states for SAT scores and graduation rates is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States government has increased its employment base by 176,000 people in the last four years is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total employment in the federal government has been relatively stable over the past four years. In fact, the federal government's employment has decreased slightly from 2.7 million in 2017 to 2.6 million in 2021. Therefore, the claim that the government has increased its employment base by 176,000 people is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a person has never voted for a federal restriction on gun ownership. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting records of the person in question. Without specific information about the person's voting history, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
"Explanation: The claim that 12,808 people were arrested for marijuana-related crimes in Oregon in 2012 is false. According to the Oregon State Police, the number of marijuana-related arrests in 2012 was significantly lower. The actual number of marijuana-related arrests in Oregon in 2012 was around 1,000.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual's legal actions and political stances. To verify the claim, we need to check if the person in question has indeed sued gun manufacturers and if they were supportive of Brady and assault weapon bans. Without specific names or additional context, it's challenging to confirm the claim's accuracy. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a well-known public figure, such as a politician or activist, we can look up their history to verify the claim.

"Explanation: The claim is false. U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, D-Macon, has not sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China. This claim is a misinterpretation or fabrication of his actual activities and policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the wealth gap between blacks and whites in the United States is greater than the black-white wealth gap in apartheid South Africa is false. While the wealth gap in the United States is significant, it is not greater than the wealth gap in apartheid South Africa. In apartheid South Africa, the wealth gap was extreme due to the systematic and legalized discrimination against the black population. In contrast, while the United States has a significant wealth gap, it is not as extreme as the gap in apartheid South Africa.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, redistricting commissions are typically established by state legislatures or through ballot initiatives. The members of these commissions are usually appointed or elected, and they are subject to various ethical standards and laws. If a member of a redistricting commission were to accept a bribe, they would be subject to legal consequences, including removal from the commission. The claim that a member could not be removed is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme is false. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading. Social Security, on the other hand, is a government-run program that collects taxes from workers and uses those funds to pay benefits to retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased workers. The funds are not used to pay off earlier investors, but rather to provide benefits to current and future retirees based on a pay-as-you-go system. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of a Ponzi scheme.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the vast majority of Syrian refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work is a generalization that does not accurately reflect the diversity of the Syrian refugee population. According to various studies and reports from organizations like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Syrian refugee population is diverse and includes people of all ages, genders, and abilities. While it is true that some refugees are young men seeking work, the majority of refugees are women, children, elderly, and those with disabilities. The claim also overlooks the fact that many refugees are fleeing conflict and seeking safety, not necessarily work.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Our men and women of the Guard have been forced to contact food banks to feed themselves"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Scott Walker, a former governor of Wisconsin and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, has been known for his strong stance against abortion. He has supported restrictions on abortion, including a 20-week ban and a requirement for women to view an ultrasound before having an abortion. While his views are indeed restrictive, it is difficult to definitively say that his views are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times. Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush also had strong anti-abortion stances, and some of their policies were similarly restrictive. Therefore, the claim that Walker's views are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, known as the ""Ryan Budget"" or ""Ryan Plan,"" was a part of the 2012 Republican budget proposal. It did not allow insurance companies to deny coverage or drop people for pre-existing conditions. Instead, it aimed to reduce the federal deficit by making changes to Medicare and other programs. The proposal was criticized for potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries and was not enacted into law.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that of the four statewide races this century within a 300-vote margin, three have been overturned in a recount. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that three out of four such races have been overturned. In fact, only one of the four races within a 300-vote margin in this century has been overturned in a recount. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, the vaccination rate in Texas has not reached 95%. The actual vaccination rate in Texas has been fluctuating but has not exceeded 80% as of the latest data available. Therefore, the claim that the vaccination rate was 95% when the person left office is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Central Health is the only hospital district in Texas that spends taxpayer dollars on abortions is false. While Central Health does provide abortion services, it is not the only hospital district in Texas that does so. Other hospital districts in Texas, such as Harris Health System and Parkland Health and Hospital System, also provide abortion services. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about restoring voting rights to non-violent felons is a complex issue that varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, for example, some states have laws that automatically restore voting rights to non-violent felons upon completion of their sentences, while others do not. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context and location.

Answer: 0/1"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of positions eliminated by Chesterfield County's general government operations to the number of positions eliminated by the entire state government of Virginia since 2009. To verify this claim, one would need to obtain specific data on the number of positions eliminated in both entities over the specified period. Without such data, it is impossible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it requires specific data to be verified.)"
"Explanation: The claim that the Koch network is spending more money in a Senate race in Ohio than anywhere else in the country is not accurate. While the Koch network has been active in various political races across the country, including in Ohio, there is no evidence to suggest that they are spending more money in Ohio than in any other state. The Koch network's spending is often targeted at specific races and issues, but it is not accurate to say that they are spending more in Ohio than anywhere else.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the government does not need a warrant to read your old emails is false. In most jurisdictions, including the United States, the government generally needs a warrant or other legal authorization to access private communications, including old emails. This is governed by laws such as the Fourth Amendment in the U.S., which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, there are exceptions and specific circumstances where such access might be permitted without a warrant, but these are typically limited and require a high standard of evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""The poorest in this country are women"" is a generalization and can be misleading. While it is true that women often face unique challenges such as the gender wage gap and higher rates of poverty due to factors like caregiving responsibilities and lack of access to education and economic opportunities, it is not accurate to say that all women are the poorest in the country. Poverty is a complex issue influenced by various factors including race, ethnicity, age, and geographical location. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Dow Chemical's decision to build a plant in Saudi Arabia rather than Oklahoma is primarily driven by economic factors, such as access to natural gas and other resources, rather than environmental regulations. The company's official statements and reports indicate that the decision was based on strategic business considerations, including market demand and resource availability.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Newark was paying 80 percent of its school budget from local property taxes is not accurate. According to the Newark Public Schools' budget reports, the percentage of the budget funded by local property taxes is typically around 30-40%, not 80%. The majority of the budget is funded by state and federal sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""In every state, women are paid less than men"" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that, on average, women earn less than men in many states, there are exceptions. For instance, in some states, women may earn more than men on average. Additionally, the wage gap can vary significantly depending on the specific occupation, industry, and other factors. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has indeed proposed various immigration reform plans that include legalizing certain groups of undocumented immigrants. However, the specific claim that he has said we should make the 11 million illegal workers legal is not a direct quote from him. He has advocated for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but the exact number of 11 million is not part of his specific proposals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama 'only wants your children to have health insurance'"" is a misrepresentation of President Obama's policies. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did expand health insurance coverage for children, it also aimed to provide health insurance for adults and improve the overall healthcare system. The claim simplifies and misrepresents the broader goals and impacts of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Josh Mandel, a former Ohio state treasurer and current U.S. Senate candidate, has publicly opposed federal loans to the auto industry. He has argued that such loans are not necessary and that the industry should be allowed to stand on its own merits.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal law known as the ""Gun Control Act of 1968"" prohibits individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes from possessing firearms. This law applies to gun shows and other retail sales of firearms. While there may be some loopholes or inconsistencies in the enforcement of these laws, the claim that convicted abusers can simply walk into a gun show and purchase a gun without any questions asked is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the high-speed rail project creating 60,000-plus jobs for Floridians is based on a study conducted by the Florida Department of Transportation. The study estimated that the project would create approximately 60,000 jobs during the construction phase. This claim is supported by official sources and is therefore likely to be true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Today almost half our debt is owned by foreigners"" is not accurate.

This percentage has been fluctuating over time but has not reached the ""almost half"" threshold.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a specific Republican was the only one to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. To verify this claim, I would need to check the voting records of the House of Representatives for the specific vote in question. However, without specific details about the vote and the member's name, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has a track record of not raising taxes"" is vague and does not provide specific details or evidence. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need more context, such as the name of the person making the claim, the specific time period, and the political or economic context. Without this information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""Were No. 1 in child hunger"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. It is not clear what ""Were No. 1"" refers to (e.g., a country, a year, a specific metric). Without additional information, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Therefore, it cannot be accurately judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Glenn Hegar, the Texas Lieutenant Governor, has been a vocal advocate for reducing public school funding. He has supported legislation that has led to cuts in public school funding. Therefore, it is plausible that he expressed pride in these cuts.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas is false. The U.S. government has long maintained a policy of not providing direct aid to Hamas due to its designation as a terrorist organization. The U.S. has provided humanitarian aid to Gaza through other channels, but this has been done through international organizations and not directly to Hamas. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of U.S. foreign policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is making voting more difficult by closing Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices where low-income voters live is a misrepresentation of the facts. The DMV office closures are part of a broader effort to consolidate and streamline government services, not specifically targeted at low-income voters. Additionally, the closures do not directly impact voting, as voters can still register and vote at other DMV offices or through other methods such as absentee voting or early voting.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the alternative to higher state worker pension and health care payments is to lay off 1,500 state employees or remove 200,000 children from Medicaid-related programs. This claim is false because it presents a false dichotomy. The alternative to higher state worker pension and health care payments is not necessarily to lay off employees or remove children from Medicaid. There are other options such as reducing other state expenditures, increasing taxes, or finding other sources of revenue. The claim also does not provide any evidence or context to support the numbers given (1,500 layoffs and 200,000 children).

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we actually don't have that many public employees and are well below average in the number of public employees is false. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United States has one of the highest levels of public employment among developed countries. As of 2021, the U.S. had approximately 2.1 million federal employees, which is a significant number compared to other countries. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has a low number of public employees is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Walton family, through their holding company Walton Enterprises, does indeed have significant wealth, but it is not accurate to say that they own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America. According to Forbes, the Walton family's wealth is estimated to be around $200 billion, while the bottom 40 percent of Americans have a combined wealth of around $1.5 trillion. Therefore, the claim that the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On high-speed rail"" is incomplete and lacks specific context or details. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false. High-speed rail systems exist in various countries, but the claim does not specify a particular context or claim about them.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) regularly publishes reports on programs at high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. The GAO's High-Risk List for Fiscal Year 2021, for example, includes programs such as the Department of Defense's acquisition programs, the Department of Health and Human Services' Medicare program, and the Internal Revenue Service's tax administration program. These programs are not targeted for elimination or severe cutback in House Republican spending plans, but they are listed as high-risk programs by the GAO.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton has said she is going to ""wipe out the Second Amendment"" is false. Hillary Clinton has never made such a statement. She has consistently supported gun control measures, but her proposals have not included the elimination of the Second Amendment. Additionally, the claim that she does not believe in the First Amendment is also false. Hillary Clinton has publicly supported freedom of speech and the First Amendment. The claim that she believes in big government and that this flies in the face of the 10th Amendment is also misleading. Hillary Clinton has supported some government programs and regulations, but she has also advocated for states' rights and has not proposed a complete disregard for the 10th Amendment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that voter fraud provided a portion of the margin of victory of Democrat John Lehman over Republican Sen. Van Wanggaard in a state Senate recall election is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Georgia's illegal immigration crackdown laws should be called the ""Brown Codes"" due to their similarity to the Black Codes is a misinterpretation of historical context and a misuse of terminology. The Black Codes were a set of laws passed in the Southern United States after the Civil War to control and subjugate the newly freed slaves. The term ""Brown Codes"" is not a recognized historical term and does not have a specific meaning in the context of immigration laws. The comparison between the two sets of laws is not accurate or appropriate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by incoming House Speaker Dean Cannon and incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos regarding their plans for the next legislative session.

"Explanation: Texas does not have a state-level equal pay law, but it is not accurate to say that it is one of only a handful of states without such a law. Many states do not have their own equal pay laws, and the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963 is the primary legislation addressing equal pay. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""by 2009, dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield by drones"" is true. The use of drones for targeted strikes against senior terrorist leaders, including Osama bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and other high-value targets, was a significant part of U.S. counter-terrorism strategy in the late 2000s. By 2009, several high-profile terrorist leaders had been eliminated through drone strikes.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Tommy Thompson, a former Secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush, has been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has publicly stated his opposition to it. He has also been critical of the mandate and has advocated for its repeal. There is no evidence to support the claim that he favors the mandate or was thanked by Obama for health reform support.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that faculty salaries at UW System institutions have now fallen more than 18 percent below the national average is not supported by reliable data or sources.

"Explanation: The claim that the Democratic Party created a debate schedule to maximize the opportunity for voters to see their candidates is true. The Democratic Party has indeed been proactive in scheduling debates to ensure that their candidates have ample opportunities to reach voters and discuss their platforms.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal government's share of the gross domestic product (GDP) has been increasing over time, not decreasing. In 2020, the federal government's share of GDP was around 24.9%, which is higher than the 20% mentioned in the claim. The claim also incorrectly states that the private sector has lost 5% of its share, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Governor Rick Scott is spending a quarter of a million of our tax dollars to robocall people is false. There is no evidence or credible source supporting this claim. Robocalls are typically used by political campaigns or other organizations to reach a large number of people quickly, but they are not funded by tax dollars. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a false statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that South Florida has experienced nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s is not accurate. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the global sea level has risen by about 8 inches (20 cm) since the 1920s. While sea-level rise can vary regionally, the claim of nine inches specifically for South Florida is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney has a corporation in Bermuda and failed to disclose it on seven different financial disclosures is false. Mitt Romney has indeed disclosed his financial interests, including those in Bermuda, in his financial disclosure forms. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the information provided in his financial disclosures.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Washing hands and covering your mouth when you cough are indeed effective measures to reduce the transmission of the flu. These practices help prevent the spread of viruses by removing germs from your hands and preventing the spread of respiratory droplets.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that the president of the United States visited a ward that had a high percentage of votes for him in the last election, but the vote count did not increase. This claim is not verifiable with the information provided and lacks specific details about the ward, the president's visit, and the vote count. Without concrete evidence or a source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, public employees have the right to choose whether or not to join a union, but this is not a new policy. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 already provides this right. The claim suggests that this is a new policy, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a proposal to boost the teacher pension fund puts no mandate on local government. This claim is false because the proposal to boost the teacher pension fund would likely involve some form of mandate or requirement for local governments to contribute to the fund. The specifics of the mandate would depend on the details of the proposal, but the general idea is that local governments would be required to contribute to the fund to ensure its sustainability and to meet the needs of retired teachers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not help a man accused of raping a 12-year-old, nor was she seen laughing at the girl who was raped.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker said no to equal pay for equal work for women is false. Gov. Scott Walker, who served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, did not publicly oppose equal pay for equal work for women. In fact, he signed a bill into law in 2014 that prohibited employers from asking job applicants about their salary history, which is a common practice that can perpetuate wage gaps.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and appeared wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. Hillary Clinton did not spend 30 days in the hospital in 2012, and she has not been reported to have a traumatic brain injury. The claim is likely a misinterpretation of her health issues and the use of glasses for other reasons.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Portland having 84 public relations representatives on payroll costing taxpayers over $6.2 million annually is not accurate. According to the City of Portland's official budget documents, the number of public relations staff and their associated costs are not as high as claimed.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Saddam Hussein had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida is false. While there were some contacts between Saddam Hussein's regime and al-Qaida, particularly in the 1990s, these were not long-term or strategic alliances. The relationship was more opportunistic and tactical, with both parties seeking to use each other for their own purposes. The claim of a 10-year relationship is an exaggeration and not supported by historical evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""every 85 visitors create one Florida job"" is a generalization that does not provide specific context or data to support it. The relationship between tourism and job creation can vary greatly depending on factors such as the type of tourism, the local economy, and the specific businesses involved. Without specific data or studies to back up this claim, it is not accurate to say that every 85 visitors create one job.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that heroin primarily comes from Mexico and over the border is true.

"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the New Jersey Office of the Governor, the number of state employees has indeed decreased since 2001. In 2001, there were approximately 53,000 state employees, while in 2021, there were around 48,000. This reduction was achieved through attrition, not layoffs, as stated in the claim.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Lower Manhattan (Manhattan Community District 1) in 2010 was approximately 100,000 people. By 2020, the population had increased to around 120,000 people, which is a 20% increase, not a doubling. In contrast, the combined population of Atlanta, Dallas, and Philadelphia in 2020 was approximately 5.5 million people, which is significantly higher than the population of Lower Manhattan.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the American slave trade caused 5 million deaths or more is an exaggeration. While the transatlantic slave trade was a brutal and deadly enterprise, the number of deaths is estimated to be around 1.8 million, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database. This figure includes deaths during the Middle Passage, as well as those who died in the Americas due to harsh conditions and diseases. Therefore, the claim that the American slave trade caused 5 million deaths or more is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Saints will go undefeated and win the Super Bowl is a prediction about future events. Predictions about sports outcomes are inherently uncertain and cannot be definitively judged as true or false until the events occur. Therefore, this claim cannot be evaluated as true or false based on current information.

Answer: N/A"
"Explanation: The claim that a particular General Assembly is one of the most expensive, per capita, in the entire country is difficult to verify without specific data. The cost of a General Assembly can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, size, and the services provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of job losses in Florida due to the stimulus program is not accurately represented by the figure of 211,000. The actual number of job losses in Florida during the period in question was significantly lower. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the city of Providence had the lowest crime rate in 30 years during the time the speaker was mayor is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to compare crime rates during the speaker's tenure with historical data from the past 30 years. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of Obamacare is false. Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was designed to expand access to health insurance, not reduce it. The ACA has actually increased the number of people with health insurance in Kansas and across the country. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsured rate in Kansas decreased from 14.9% in 2013 to 7.5% in 2019, which is a significant reduction in the number of uninsured individuals. Therefore, the claim that 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance due to Obamacare is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The United Nations (U.N.) does not have the authority to create or enforce gun laws within the United States. The U.S. government would need to ratify any U.N. treaty on conventional arms, but this would not automatically subject U.S. citizens to those gun laws. The U.S. Constitution and federal laws would still govern gun ownership and use within the country.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""most of our new jobs have been part-time jobs since Obamacare became law"" is not accurate. While it is true that the number of part-time jobs has increased since the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was implemented, this is not the primary reason for the increase in part-time jobs. The increase in part-time jobs is more likely due to economic factors such as the Great Recession, changes in the job market, and the preferences of employers and employees. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that ""most"" new jobs have been part-time.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""We have killed lots of innocent people in the state of Texas"" is a broad and vague statement that lacks specific context or evidence. It is not possible to accurately assess the truth of this claim without more detailed information about who is making the claim, the time period, and the specific incidents being referred to. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits health insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to individuals based on pre-existing conditions, including domestic violence. This is part of the ACA's essential health benefits and nondiscrimination provisions. While there may be some exceptions or nuances in specific cases, the general rule is that health insurance companies cannot deny coverage based on a history of domestic violence.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: Dan Seals, a former Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2018, was born in 1959. The iPod was introduced in 2001, which means Dan Seals was already an adult when the iPod was released. Therefore, the claim that he has been running for office since before there were iPods is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Miami Dolphins are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes is false. All NFL teams pay property taxes on their stadiums and other properties. For example, the New England Patriots pay property taxes on Gillette Stadium, and the Dallas Cowboys pay property taxes on AT&T Stadium. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison served in the Senate from 1993 to 2013. During her tenure, she voted on the debt ceiling multiple times. However, the claim that she voted ""nine separate times"" is not accurate. She voted on the debt ceiling on several occasions, but the exact number of times is not specified in the claim.

"Explanation: The claim is true. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also known as Medicare Part D, was signed into law by President George W. Bush.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: According to a 2021 report by Child Care Aware of America, the average annual cost of child care in the United States is $10,750 for a child in a center-based program. Meanwhile, the average cost of tuition for a four-year public college in the 2020-2021 academic year was $10,560. However, costs can vary significantly by state. For example, in California, the average annual cost of child care is $14,000, which exceeds the average cost of tuition in the state. Therefore, the claim that child care costs in some states now exceed the average price tag for college tuition is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that 85% of the funds collected in each county will be redistributed elsewhere, not spent in the county in which it is collected. This claim is false because it is not based on any specific policy or law. The redistribution of funds is typically determined by the government or the organization collecting the funds, and the percentage redistributed can vary greatly depending on the context and the specific policy in place.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay in the U.S. is 475 to 1 is based on a study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) in 2018. The study found that the average CEO pay was 312 times the average worker pay. However, the claim states a ratio of 475 to 1, which is not accurate based on the EPI's findings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that more than 100,000 women in Texas have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone is not supported by credible sources. The Texas Department of Health and Human Services does not provide specific data on self-induced abortions, and the claim is not backed by any reputable news outlets or studies. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of data on abortion access and methods.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the platform of the Republican Party says ""deport everybody and to hell with it"" is a misrepresentation of the party's actual stance. The Republican Party's official platform does not contain such language. The party's platform focuses on issues such as immigration reform, border security, and the enforcement of immigration laws, but it does not advocate for the mass deportation of all immigrants. The phrase ""deport everybody and to hell with it"" is not found in the party's official documents.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote is false. Noncitizens, by definition, are not eligible to vote in most countries, including the United States. Therefore, it is not possible for 14 percent of noncitizens to be registered to vote.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""thirty-four percent of Hispanics don't have any health care at all, don't have any health insurance"" is based on a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2019. The study found that 34% of uninsured adults in the United States are Hispanic. However, this does not mean that 34% of all Hispanics are uninsured, as the study does not provide data on the total Hispanic population. Therefore, the claim is false as it generalizes the data to all Hispanics.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Chris Abele is a prominent figure in Milwaukee politics, having served as the Milwaukee County Executive from 2011 to 2018. However, he is not a billionaire.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that state employees will have to pay 100 percent of their pensions and health insurance after 2012 is false. This is because the specific details of pension and health insurance contributions for state employees are typically outlined in collective bargaining agreements or state laws, and such a significant change would require legislative action or collective bargaining negotiations. There is no evidence to support that such a change occurred after 2012.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that members of Congress did not have three days to read the bill when the stimulus was rushed into law is false. The CARES Act, which was the stimulus bill passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, was indeed rushed through Congress. However, the claim that members of Congress did not have three days to read the bill is inaccurate. The bill was introduced on March 16, 2020, and passed on March 27, 2020, which is a period of about 11 days, not three days. Additionally, members of Congress had access to the bill's text and were able to review it before voting.

Romney's health care reform in Massachusetts, known as the ""Romneycare"" plan, was implemented in 2006 and served as a model for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) signed into law by President Obama in 2010. Both plans aimed to expand health insurance coverage, although they differed in some aspects.

The Ryan budget proposal, which was introduced in 2013, did propose changes to Medicare, including raising the eligibility age and changing the program's financing structure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has one of America's toughest ethics laws is not accurate. While Georgia does have a strong ethics law, it is not considered one of the toughest in the country.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other sources. The statement that the wealthiest 25 percent pay 86 percent of total income taxes and the wealthiest 5 percent pay 60 percent of total income taxes is not accurate. The correct figures are as follows:
- The top 25 percent of income earners pay about 68 percent of total income taxes.
- The top 5 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of total income taxes.

These figures are based on data from the IRS and other reputable sources, such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Tax Foundation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that infant mortality within the three miles surrounding the University Circle area exceeds some Third World countries is false. Infant mortality rates are typically higher in developing countries due to factors such as lack of access to healthcare, poor nutrition, and inadequate sanitation. University Circle, located in Cleveland, Ohio, is a well-developed area with access to healthcare services, and its infant mortality rate is not significantly higher than that of many developed countries. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the infant mortality rate in the United States is around 5.6 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is lower than many Third World countries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that human activity is not causing dramatic changes to our climate is false. The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary drivers of the observed warming of the Earth's climate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests a similarity between a 1995 plot to blow up 12 jumbo jets over the Pacific Ocean and the alleged plan of Lubbock terror suspects to use baby dolls to conceal chemical explosives. However, there is no evidence or credible source that supports this claim. The 1995 plot, known as Operation Bojinka, was a complex and sophisticated plan involving multiple individuals and was not related to the use of baby dolls. The Lubbock incident, involving the use of baby dolls, is a separate event and does not have any known connection to the 1995 plot.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama has an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon is false. While the EPA under President Obama did propose regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, these regulations did not directly raise the price of gasoline. The Clean Power Plan, for example, aimed to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, but it did not target gasoline prices. The claim is a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the EPA's actions.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not give every American the same opportunity to buy health insurance as members of Congress. Members of Congress have access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a different system from the ACA. The ACA provides subsidies to help low- and middle-income individuals and families purchase health insurance, but it does not give everyone the same opportunity as Congress members.

"Explanation: The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) do not specify a minimum percentage of instructional time that must be spent on informational texts. The standards do emphasize the importance of informational texts and require that students read a variety of texts, including informational texts, but they do not mandate a specific proportion of time to be spent on them. Therefore, the claim that Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time on informational texts is false.

The story is more of a myth or urban legend rather than a factual event.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that oil companies ""haven't touched"" 68 million acres where they already have rights to drill is misleading. While it is true that some oil companies may not have drilled on all the acres they have rights to, the statement implies that these acres are untouched, which is not accurate. Oil companies often conduct exploration activities, such as seismic surveys, on these acres, even if they haven't yet drilled for oil. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Phoenix, Arizona, is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City, is false. According to the FBI's 2019 Crime in the United States report, Phoenix had 1,027 kidnapping incidents, while Mexico City had 1,200. However, the FBI's data does not rank cities by the number of kidnappings, and the claim is not supported by any reliable sources.

To evaluate its truthfulness, one would need to examine the historical record of tax policies implemented during their tenure.

However, if the claim is made by a politician, it is common for them to make such statements, and it would require independent verification to confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States rations care like systems in Canada and Great Britain is misleading. The ACA does not ration care in the same way that these countries' healthcare systems do. In Canada and Great Britain, healthcare is provided through a single-payer system, which means the government funds and manages the healthcare system. In contrast, the ACA is a complex law that expands access to health insurance through private and public options, but it does not ration care in the same way as single-payer systems. The ACA does have provisions to control costs and manage healthcare spending, but it does not limit access to care based on need or ability to pay in the same way as single-payer systems.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sandra Day O'Connor had no judicial experience before joining the Supreme Court is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was not a state senator and therefore did not have the authority to support or refuse measures in that capacity. Additionally, there is no record of him refusing to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we could cut unemployment in half simply by reclaiming the jobs taken by illegal workers is a simplification of a complex issue. While it is true that reducing the number of illegal workers could potentially create more jobs for legal workers, it is not accurate to say that this would cut unemployment in half. The relationship between illegal immigration and unemployment is complex and influenced by many factors, including the overall economy, job market demand, and the specific industries affected. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential economic impact of removing illegal workers, such as the loss of productivity and the need for new workers to fill the vacancies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median income in the United States has been increasing since the start of the recovery from the Great Recession.

"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare has led to a rise in part-time employment is a complex issue that has been debated among economists and policymakers. While some studies suggest that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, may have contributed to an increase in part-time work, particularly among low-wage workers, it is not accurate to say that this is the primary or sole reason for the trend. Other factors, such as technological changes, economic conditions, and business strategies, also play significant roles in the shift towards part-time employment. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate and should be considered false.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Census Bureau does not release figures that directly attribute population changes to tax burdens. The Census Bureau provides data on population changes, but it does not attribute those changes to specific factors like tax burdens. Therefore, the claim that the states tax burden has cost the state another 190,000 residents in 2009 is not supported by any official census figures.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that the top 20 percent of income earners pay nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes is generally accurate. According to data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other sources, the top 20 percent of income earners in the United States do indeed pay a significant portion of federal taxes.

The report states that in the 2020 election cycle, super PACs raised $1.6 billion, with about half of that coming from fewer than 200 donors and about 20 percent from corporations. The claim is a simplified version of this data, but it accurately reflects the overall trend. Therefore, the claim is true.

"Explanation: The claim that ISIS is currently crucifying Christians in Iraq is false. While ISIS has been known to commit atrocities against various religious and ethnic groups, including Christians, there is no credible evidence to support the specific claim of crucifixions.

"Explanation: The claim that the fastest-rising expense in the U.S. Defense Department is health care is not accurate. While health care costs have been increasing, the fastest-rising expense in the U.S. Defense Department is actually personnel costs. This includes salaries, benefits, and other related expenses. The increase in personnel costs is primarily due to the growing number of military personnel and the rising costs of benefits and retirement programs.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Texas is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country is an exaggeration. While Texas has been experiencing significant population growth, it is not accurate to say it is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Texas's population growth rate has been high, but it is not double the national average. For instance, in 2020, Texas's population growth rate was around 1.4%, while the national average was around 0.4%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the importance of an independent voting record is a subjective statement that can vary based on individual perspectives and political ideologies. However, it is generally accepted that an independent voting record can indicate a politician's ability to make decisions based on their own judgment rather than party lines. This can be seen as important for several reasons, such as promoting bipartisanship, encouraging compromise, and ensuring that legislation is based on the best interests of constituents rather than party politics.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a 50-50 public-private split for paying for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena would be better than most other arena projects around the country. However, this claim is subjective and depends on the specific context and criteria used to define ""better.""

The claim does not provide enough evidence or context to support its assertion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of pain clinics and McDonald's in Broward County. As of my last update, there are approximately 100 McDonald's locations in Broward County. The number of pain clinics can vary, but it is generally lower than the number of fast-food restaurants. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there are more McDonald's locations than pain clinics in Broward County.

"Explanation: The claim about the stimulus bill containing $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers and $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs is false.

"Explanation: John McCain, a Republican Senator, voted against the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. He was a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility and opposed the tax cuts, which he believed would increase the deficit.

"Explanation: The claim that ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil is not accurate. While it is true that ISIS has controlled some oil fields in Libya and has sold oil to generate revenue, the extent of their control and the amount of money they generate is often exaggerated. The United Nations and other international organizations have reported that ISIS's oil revenues are significantly lower than the claimed millions of dollars per week. Additionally, the oil sales are often conducted through informal and illegal channels, making it difficult to accurately quantify their earnings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the percentage of the federal government's spending in the U.S. economy over time. In 2020, the federal government spent approximately 24.9% of the U.S. GDP, which is indeed higher than the 2% spent in 1920. However, the claim states ""25 percent"" which is slightly higher than the actual figure. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that tens of billions of dollars from taxpayer-funded bailouts flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks is misleading and not entirely accurate. While it is true that AIG received significant bailout funds from the U.S. government, the funds were used to stabilize the company and prevent a collapse that could have had severe economic consequences. A portion of these funds was used to pay off debts and obligations, including those to foreign entities. However, the claim suggests a direct and intentional flow of funds to foreign entities, which is not supported by the facts. The bailout funds were intended to stabilize AIG and the broader financial system, not to enrich foreign corporations or banks.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a famous quote by Daniel Webster, ""I am out, and I am in."" This quote is often used to describe a situation where someone has changed their mind or position. The claim is a play on this quote, suggesting that someone has changed their mind about something. However, without additional context, it's impossible to determine the specific situation or person being referred to. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"

He was a Democrat and his policies were more accurately described as liberal or progressive.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""90 percent of that [deficit increase] is as a consequence of President George W. Bush's policies and the recession"" is not accurate. While the recession did contribute to the increase in the deficit, it is not accurate to attribute 90% of the increase to President George W. Bush's policies. The deficit increased significantly during the Bush administration, but this was also due to factors such as the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the economic stimulus packages in response to the recession. The claim oversimplifies and misattributes the cause of the deficit increase.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that a particular state is the only one in the country that bypassed the General Assembly to authorize in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported national poll that specifically states the majority of Americans believe we should have a gold standard for U.S. currency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks is false. The Armed Pilots Program, also known as the Armed Guardians Program, was established by the Trump administration in 2019. It is a program that allows armed pilots to carry firearms on commercial flights to protect against potential threats. Barack Obama was not involved in the creation or funding of this program, as he was no longer in office when it was implemented. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that he is trying to slash funding for it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the nuclear arsenal of a country is ineffective due to outdated equipment is a serious allegation that requires verification. However, the claim that the equipment is 30 years old and that its effectiveness is uncertain is not supported by credible sources. Nuclear weapons systems are typically subject to rigorous testing and maintenance protocols to ensure their reliability and effectiveness. Without specific, credible sources to back up this claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Cash for Clunkers"" program, which was a U.S. government initiative to encourage the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, did not involve the government seizing personal information or tracking computer activity.

The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the program's purpose and capabilities.

"Explanation: The claim that the state Legislature passed more than $5 billion in tax increases in 2009 is false. According to the California State Legislature's official records, the total tax increases passed in 2009 were significantly less than $5 billion. The largest tax increase passed that year was the extension of the state's sales tax by 1/4 cent, which amounted to approximately $1.5 billion annually. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Right now we are the highest taxed country in the world"" is false. The United States is not the highest taxed country in the world. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the highest taxed country in the world is France, with a total tax-to-GDP ratio of 45.4% in 2020. The United States has a total tax-to-GDP ratio of 24.9% in 2020.

"Explanation: The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was a U.S. government program created in response to the financial crisis of 2008. The program involved the government providing funds to financial institutions in exchange for preferred stock or other securities. The goal was to stabilize the financial system and prevent further collapse. The first round of repayments from financial institutions that received TARP money did not necessarily result in a profit for the government. The government's goal was to recoup the funds and stabilize the financial system, not to make a profit. Therefore, the claim that the government turned a profit in the first round of repayments is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Border Patrol signs near the Mexico border are in English, Spanish, and Chinese is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that every governor at the midterm of their first term has lost seats in the Legislature, with the exception of Jim McGreevey in 2003. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that every governor has lost seats in the Legislature at the midterm of their first term. There are exceptions to this rule, and the claim incorrectly implies that Jim McGreevey is the only exception.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific study or report from the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) regarding the impact of light rail in Cobb County on commute times and traffic congestion. However, without specific details or references to the study, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. Typically, such claims would need to be backed by empirical data and analysis from the GRTA or other reputable sources. If the claim is based on a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the study's findings, it would be false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the state's rainy day fund has grown by 643 percent since Gov. Nathan Deal's office in 2011 is false. The rainy day fund is a fund that states use to save money during economic downturns. The growth of the fund is typically measured in terms of the fund's balance relative to the state's budget or other relevant metrics, not as a percentage increase. The claim of a 643 percent increase is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the fund's growth.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama built this $16 trillion debt is false. The debt level of $16 trillion was reached during the Obama administration, but it is not accurate to say that he ""built"" this debt. The debt level increased due to a combination of factors, including the economic crisis of 2008, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and other policies implemented during his presidency. However, it is not accurate to attribute the entire debt to his actions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing tax laws in the United States. However, the IRS does not have any authority over healthcare. The healthcare system in the U.S. is primarily regulated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Therefore, the claim that the IRS is going to be in charge of our healthcare is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The phrase ""endowed by their Creator"" is not found in the original text of the Declaration of Independence. The phrase ""endowed by their Creator"" was added to the Declaration of Independence by the U.S. Congress in 1952, and it was not part of the original text written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776. Therefore, no president has deliberately removed these words, as they were not originally present in the document.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's presidential victory was an electoral landslide is false. While Trump did win the presidency, the margin of victory was not a landslide. In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Trump won the electoral college vote by 304 to 227, but he did not win the popular vote. He received approximately 46.1% of the popular vote, while Hillary Clinton received approximately 48.2%. The difference in the popular vote was about 2.1 million votes, which is not considered a landslide.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin's rainy day fund is 165 times bigger than when you first took office is not accurate. The rainy day fund, also known as the budget stabilization fund, is a fund that states use to manage fluctuations in revenue.

Without specific data or context, it's not possible to verify the claim that the fund has grown 165 times since a specific point in time.

"Explanation: The claim that Ted Cruz has not led businesses is false. Ted Cruz has been a businessman before entering politics. He co-founded a consulting firm called ""Cruz & Associates"" in 2003, which he led until 2007. He also worked as a lawyer and served as the Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2007. Therefore, he has led businesses and held professional positions before his political career.

Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being a true or false claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Joint Ways Means Committee is a fictional entity, and there is no record of a Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project bridge. The claim is likely a fabrication or a misinterpretation of actual events.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is attempting to put the $1 trillion economic stimulus plan into perspective by comparing it to the amount of money that would have been spent if $1 million was spent every day since the birth of Jesus Christ. To evaluate this claim, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent over that period.

Assuming Jesus Christ was born in 4 BC, the number of years since then is approximately 2021 - 4 = 2017 years. If $1 million was spent every day for 2017 years, the total amount spent would be:

2017 years * 365 days/year * $1 million/day = $730,450,000,000

This is indeed less than $1 trillion, so the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The individual in question, James Clapper, was indeed appointed by Eric Holder to investigate government leaks. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that he helped or donated to Obama's campaign or was involved in vetting vice presidential prospects. These are unfounded allegations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""As the Democrats finally maxed out their government spending credit card Monday"" is a metaphorical and hyperbolic way of saying that the Democrats have reached their limit on government spending. However, the claim that Kurt Schrader, a Democratic Congressman from Oregon, ""continued to stand with his party leaders in failing to offer any viable long-term solution"" is not accurate. Kurt Schrader has been vocal about his support for fiscal responsibility and has proposed various solutions to address the debt and deficit. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""Could I just point out that ... I seem to get the first question all the time?"" is a subjective statement and does not provide any verifiable information. It is not possible to objectively determine the truth of this claim without additional context or evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal deficit for the fiscal year 2021 was approximately $2.8 trillion. The average salary of a professional baseball player in 2013 was around $4 million. To calculate the total salary for all players in 2013, we would need the number of players, which is approximately 800 (400 in the MLB and 400 in the minor leagues). So, the total salary for all players in 2013 would be around $3.2 billion. The claim suggests that the deficit could pay for these salaries for 248 years, which is not accurate. The deficit is not a fixed amount that can be used to pay for salaries over a long period. It is a measure of the government's annual spending exceeding its annual revenue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Portland has won more national Constitution contests than any city in America is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no widely recognized or standardized national Constitution contest that Portland has won more times than any other city.

Political rhetoric often involves generalizations and accusations that may not be supported by specific facts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation. To evaluate this claim, I would need to know the specific legislation being referred to. However, without specific details, I cannot definitively say whether this claim is true or false. If the legislation in question explicitly states that there will be no public funding for abortion, then the claim would be true. If the legislation allows for public funding or does not explicitly state that there will be no public funding, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0/1 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
"Explanation: Virginia does not have a major league sports team. The closest major league teams are the Washington Nationals (based in Washington, D.C.) and the Baltimore Orioles (based in Baltimore, Maryland). Therefore, the claim that Virginia is the biggest state without a major league sports team is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that there is no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant and that higher CO2 concentrations actually help ecosystems is false. While it is true that CO2 is a natural part of the Earth's atmosphere and is essential for plant growth, the claim that it is not a pollutant is misleading. CO2 is considered a pollutant because it contributes to climate change, which has significant negative impacts on ecosystems, including increased temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent and severe weather events. Higher CO2 concentrations can indeed stimulate plant growth in the short term, but the long-term effects of increased CO2 levels on ecosystems are overwhelmingly negative.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Mike Martinez, a former city councilman in San Diego, was convicted of misconduct in office and fraud. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, not avoided jail time. The $24,657.50 figure is the amount he was ordered to pay in restitution, not a legal bill. The claim misrepresents the facts of the case.

The U.S. military provides religious materials to detainees, including prayer rugs, but these are not paid for by taxpayers. The claim about the food is also false, as detainees are provided with standard military rations, not honey-glazed chicken and rice pilaf.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""about 25 Texas cities and 39 states have banned texting while driving"" is false. While many states and cities have laws against texting while driving, the numbers provided are not accurate. As of my last update, Texas has a law against texting while driving, but it is not accurate to say that 25 Texas cities have banned it. Additionally, the number of states with such bans is more than 39, but the exact number can vary depending on the specific laws and their enforcement.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that the Bush tax cuts created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years they were in existence is a simplification of a complex economic issue. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) has conducted studies that suggest the Bush tax cuts did not create a significant number of jobs. Instead, they argue that the tax cuts primarily benefited the wealthy and did not stimulate job growth. Additionally, the claim that 5 million jobs were lost during the recession is accurate, but it does not directly relate to the impact of the Bush tax cuts. The recession was caused by a variety of factors, including the housing market collapse and the financial crisis.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the swearing-in process for a Massachusetts official was delayed to allow for the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim. The ACA was passed in 2010, and the swearing-in process for Massachusetts officials would not have been directly affected by its passage. The claim appears to be a conspiracy theory without factual basis.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Saudi Arabia is the only country in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) where women cannot get licenses to drive, there are other Muslim-majority countries where women also face restrictions on driving. For example, in Yemen, women are not allowed to drive in certain areas, and in some parts of Afghanistan, women are not allowed to drive at all. Therefore, the claim that Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim country where women cannot get licenses to drive is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that federal employees' benefits and wages far outstrip the market rates of the private sector is a complex issue that depends on various factors. While it is true that federal employees often receive certain benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and job security, these benefits are not always directly comparable to private sector wages. Additionally, federal employees' wages are often lower than those in the private sector for similar positions. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) which estimated that ending the direct payment farm subsidy program could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years. The CBO's report is a credible source, and the claim accurately reflects the findings of the report. Therefore, the claim is true.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not suggest that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. In fact, Romney has been a strong advocate for women's health and has supported access to contraception. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his views.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The Republican Party platform has historically advocated for less regulation on campaign finance, including the repeal of the McCain-Feingold Act, which was a significant piece of campaign finance reform legislation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that DeKalb County has cut more money from its general fund budget than any local government in the Atlanta metro region is difficult to verify without specific data and context. Budget cuts can vary greatly depending on the fiscal year, the specific programs or services being cut, and the overall economic conditions. Without concrete evidence or a comparison with other local governments in the Atlanta metro region, it is not possible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rubio's tax swap proposal ""would have been a massive tax increase"" is false. Rubio's proposal, which was part of his 2016 presidential campaign, aimed to reduce the corporate tax rate and offset the revenue loss by closing loopholes and eliminating certain tax credits. While some aspects of the proposal could have led to increased taxes for certain individuals or businesses, the overall goal was to simplify the tax code and reduce the overall tax burden. Therefore, the claim that it would have been a ""massive tax increase"" is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that mayors have the power to block water treatment plants that are intended to treat cryptosporidium, even if a company like CH2M Hill wants to build them. This is a false claim because mayors do not have the authority to block such projects based on their personal beliefs or the desires of a company. The decision to build water treatment plants is typically made by local or state authorities based on public health needs and regulatory requirements.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida was No. 1 in violent crime in America in the mid-1990s is false. According to FBI crime statistics, in 1995, Florida ranked 10th in the nation for violent crime rates. The claim that citizens of Florida were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds is also incorrect. The actual rate of violent crimes per capita in Florida in 1995 was much lower than the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker's listening sessions are invite-only and excluding the press is false. Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, has held public listening sessions where he has invited the public to attend and participate. These sessions are open to the public and are not restricted to invite-only attendees. Therefore, the claim that the press is excluded is also false, as the press is typically allowed to attend and report on these events.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that right-to-work states are creating more jobs than heavily unionized states is a complex issue that depends on various factors. Studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of right-to-work laws on job creation. Some studies suggest that right-to-work laws can lead to increased job growth, while others find no significant difference or even a negative impact. The job creation rate can also be influenced by other factors such as economic conditions, industry trends, and government policies. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that right-to-work states are consistently creating more jobs than heavily unionized states.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the leader of ISIS was imprisoned by American troops and ordered released to Iraq by the Obama administration in 2009 is false. The leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was not imprisoned by American troops. He was captured in 2014 and killed by American forces in 2019. The claim about his imprisonment and release in 2009 is a misinterpretation of events and is not supported by credible sources.

He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and voted on various bills, including those related to education funding. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he personally took money away from schools or voted to build a politician's palace. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of his actions.

"Explanation: North Korea is known to have a large standing army, but the claim that it has the largest per capita is not accurate. While North Korea has one of the largest armies in terms of total numbers, when considering the population, other countries like Israel and Singapore have larger armies per capita. Therefore, the claim that North Korea has the largest army per capita is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that an Iranian woman risks being beaten or killed for showing too much hair in public is a misrepresentation of the reality in Iran. While there are strict dress codes and laws regarding public behavior in Iran, the claim is an exaggeration and not based on accurate information. The Iranian government enforces laws that require women to wear the hijab, but these laws do not extend to the extent of physical violence or death for showing hair. The claim is likely a result of misinformation or sensationalism.

"Explanation: Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop"" by political opponents.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has not publicly stated that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. While she has expressed support for certain gun control measures, such as universal background checks and closing loopholes in the current system, she has not advocated for the complete abolition of the Second Amendment. Therefore, the claim that she wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the salaries of top officials at the Port Authority with the salaries of governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them. The Port Authority is a bi-state agency that serves New York and New Jersey, and its top officials are not directly comparable to governors of these states. Governors are elected officials with salaries set by their respective state legislatures, while top officials at the Port Authority are appointed and their salaries are set by the Port Authority's board of directors. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true. In the 1980s, the Democratic administration of President Jimmy Carter did propose spending cuts, but the subsequent administration of President Ronald Reagan implemented significant tax cuts. Therefore, the claim that Democrats delivered only tax hikes is not accurate, as they did not deliver any tax hikes during their time in office.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved is not accurate. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the clearance rate for murders in St. Louis has been fluctuating but has generally been above 50% in recent years. For instance, in 2019, the clearance rate was 60.5%, and in 2020, it was 59.3%. Therefore, the claim that only half of the murders are solved is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The legislation in question is the USA PATRIOT Act, which Senator John McCain supported. This act does not provide the authority for the federal government to surveil American citizens without any suspicion of terrorist activity or criminal behavior.

"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker received a $7,300 pay raise is false. According to the Wisconsin State Legislature's website, the governor's salary is set by law and does not change unless the legislature votes to increase it. As of my last update, Gov. Walker's salary was $159,000 per year, and there is no evidence of a $7,300 increase.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 48% and 49% of President Barack Obama's supporters are people who pay no income tax is a misinterpretation of a statement made by Mitt Romney during the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Romney's statement was based on a report from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that showed 47% of Americans did not pay federal income taxes in 2011. However, this does not mean that 48% or 49% of Obama's supporters are non-taxpayers. The claim is false because it misrepresents the data and implies a direct correlation between political support and tax status that is not supported by the facts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not send a much larger force to deal with Ebola than ISIS. In fact, the U.S. response to Ebola in West Africa was primarily focused on medical and humanitarian efforts, rather than a military response. The U.S. military was involved in providing logistical support and medical care, but the number of troops deployed was not significantly larger than those involved in the fight against ISIS.

However, when considering total energy resources, including coal, oil, and natural gas, Russia is the largest producer, followed by the United States.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to the United States by 550 percent is false. Hillary Clinton did not propose such a policy during her 2016 presidential campaign. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a deliberate distortion of her stance on refugee policy. Clinton's proposed plan was to accept a higher number of refugees, but not to a degree that would increase the number by 550 percent.

Answer: 0/1 (I cannot determine the truth of the claim without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim about New Jersey's tenure law being reformed to state that teachers lose tenure after two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings is false. New Jersey's tenure law, as of my last update, does not include such a provision.

"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by James Hansen, a prominent climate scientist. Hansen has indeed warned about the potential for significant sea-level rise due to climate change. However, the specific numbers mentioned in the claim (50 years, 10, 20, 30 feet of sea-level rise) are not accurate representations of Hansen's statements. Hansen has stated that sea levels could rise by several meters over the next century, but the exact figures and timeframes mentioned in the claim are not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that more people are losing their insurance than are becoming newly insured due to Obamacare is not accurate. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to increase the number of people with health insurance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the uninsured rate in the United States has been declining since the implementation of the ACA. In 2010, the uninsured rate was 16.0%, and by 2019, it had dropped to 8.9%. This indicates that more people have gained insurance coverage than have lost it.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the current numbers (which are not specified) to Ronald Reagan's numbers during his presidency. Without specific data points or context, it's impossible to verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is referring to polling numbers or approval ratings, it would be necessary to compare the current numbers to Reagan's approval ratings during his presidency with Jimmy Carter as the previous president. Without this specific data, the claim cannot be accurately evaluated.

"Explanation: The claim that the president referred to the Syrian opposition as ""pharmacists and doctors"" is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim.

"Explanation: The claim that the racial and ethnic makeup of the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office mirrors the community it serves is not necessarily true. While it is important for law enforcement to reflect the diversity of the community they serve, the actual makeup of the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office may not perfectly mirror the community's demographics. This is due to various factors such as recruitment processes, hiring practices, and the overall diversity of the applicant pool.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that state legislators and Congress have the authority to decriminalize marijuana, local governments, including cities, also have the power to implement their own policies regarding marijuana.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a Democratic poll operation shows that Fox News is the most trusted news operation in the country is false. Polls conducted by Democratic organizations typically reflect the views of their supporters and may not be representative of the entire population. Additionally, there is no specific poll from a Democratic organization that supports this claim. Fox News is often criticized for its conservative bias, and polls from various sources often show that it is not the most trusted news operation among all Americans.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Rob Portman, a former U.S. Senator and current U.S. Trade Representative, has been involved in trade negotiations and policies, including those related to China. However, the claim that he ""failed, looked the other way, did nothing"" regarding China's illegal dumping of steel is not accurate. Portman has been actively involved in trade negotiations and has taken actions to address trade issues, including those related to steel dumping. The claim oversimplifies and misrepresents his role and actions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion rights over time. In 2012, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2020, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of fetal abnormalities. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop.""

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070 is based on projections from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The FAO has estimated that global food demand will increase by about 50% by 2050, and this projection is widely accepted by experts in the field. However, the claim specifies ""double"" which is an exaggeration of the actual projection. Therefore, while the demand for food will increase significantly, it will not double.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that every major study shows hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created by passing cap-and-trade legislation is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. While some studies have shown that cap-and-trade policies can create jobs in certain sectors, such as renewable energy, the overall impact on job creation is more nuanced and varies depending on the specific policies and economic conditions. Additionally, the claim that ""if you wind up pricing carbon"" is a bit ambiguous and could be interpreted differently depending on the context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the acceptance of gay marriage or civil unions in the country. However, it does not provide specific data or sources to support the claim. As of my last update in October 2023, the acceptance of gay marriage and civil unions varies by state and country, and a precise figure of 40% is not universally accepted or supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information indicating that the president of the United States is advocating for a drone strike program specifically in America.

"Explanation: There have been several investigations and reports about Donald Trump's business dealings, including allegations of ties to organized crime figures. However, these allegations have not been substantiated with concrete evidence. The most notable case is the Trump Tower meeting in 2016, where Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with a Russian lawyer who was said to have information that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton. While this meeting was reported, it did not involve direct ties to the mafia or mob. Therefore, the claim that there have been multiple media reports about Donald Trump's business dealings with the mob or mafia is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that the Austin Independent School District's graduation rate reached an all-time high of 82.5 percent in 2012 is false. The Austin Independent School District's graduation rate for the 2011-2012 school year was 81.5 percent, not 82.5 percent. This information can be verified through the Texas Education Agency's website, which provides annual graduation rates for school districts in Texas.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Senate Republicans have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee in the last five years is false. While Republicans have used the filibuster more frequently in recent years, it is not accurate to say that they have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee. The filibuster is a procedural tool used to delay or prevent a vote on a bill or nomination, and it is not used on every piece of legislation or every nominee. Additionally, the filibuster can be invoked by any senator, not just Republicans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Chris Christie's budget cuts did not lead to the closure of six of the state's 58 family planning centers. In fact, the closures were due to a lack of funding from the federal government, not state budget cuts. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual events.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former Sen. Tom Daschle said, ""Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them,"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the average Emergency Room (ER) wait in California is 5 hours due to the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is misleading. While the Affordable Care Act has had an impact on healthcare access and costs, it has not directly caused a significant increase in ER wait times. In fact, studies have shown that the Affordable Care Act has led to an increase in primary care visits, which can help reduce ER congestion. Additionally, the average ER wait time in California is typically around 2-3 hours, not 5 hours. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that it is rare for a retirement grade determination to be conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Balanced Budget Amendment was never close to passing Congress. It was introduced in 1995 and 1997, but it never came within one vote of passing. Additionally, Rick Santorum did not call for a top Senate Republican to resign his chairmanship. Santorum was a senator from Pennsylvania and was not involved in the Balanced Budget Amendment process in the way described in the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that California's Capitol building is second only to Disneyland among visitor sites in the state is false. While the California State Capitol is a significant and popular tourist attraction, Disneyland is far more visited. According to data from the California State Capitol Museum, the Capitol receives around 1.5 million visitors per year, while Disneyland attracts over 18 million visitors annually. Therefore, Disneyland is the most visited site in California, not the California State Capitol.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on projections and estimates, which can change over time. The interest payments on the national debt and defense spending are both subject to various factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and budgetary decisions.

"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs is a complex issue that requires a nuanced analysis. Walker's policies, such as the repeal of collective bargaining rights for public employees and the implementation of various business-friendly regulations, have been criticized for potentially leading to job losses. However, attributing a specific number of job losses to Walker's actions is challenging due to the multitude of factors that influence job markets, including economic trends, industry-specific issues, and broader national and global economic conditions. Therefore, the claim that Walker's actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs is not verifiable with the information provided.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that House Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks is false. David Obey's partial earmark ban, which was implemented in 2007, aimed to reduce the influence of lawmakers in the appropriations process by limiting the use of earmarks. However, the ban did not apply to all earmarks, but it significantly reduced their number and influence. The claim that it wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks is an exaggeration and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that 95% of climate scientists agree that humans are the primary cause of global warming. Surveys of climate scientists, such as those conducted by John Cook and others, have consistently shown that the vast majority of climate scientists (over 97%) agree that humans are the primary cause of global warming. The claim that 57% of climate scientists do not agree with this idea is not supported by scientific consensus or surveys.

"Explanation: Ken Buck, a Republican congressman from Colorado, has indeed expressed his opposition to abortion, including in cases of rape or incest. However, he has not explicitly stated that he wants to ""outlaw"" abortion in these specific cases. His stance is more about limiting access to abortion rather than completely banning it. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about Mayor Kenney's stance on the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) and his position on city employees utilizing this benefit.

"Explanation: Scott Walker, who served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, did implement significant cuts to education funding during his tenure. However, the claim that these were the ""biggest cuts in our state's history"" is subjective and depends on the specific time frame and context. While Walker's cuts were substantial, it is difficult to definitively say they were the largest in Wisconsin's history without comparing them to other periods of significant cuts.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a remark made by a speaker at an AFSCME forum in 2007. While it is true that there are jobs in fields like auto mechanics and airline mechanics that can be well-paying, the claim that 60% of kids are not going to college and that these jobs are unfilled is not supported by current data. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021, about 68% of high school graduates were enrolled in postsecondary education, and the unemployment rate for high school graduates was around 6.5%. Additionally, the claim that these jobs are unfilled is not accurate as there are often more job seekers than available positions in these fields.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""I am every year the No.1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas"" is highly unlikely to be true. Law enforcement agencies typically have specific criteria and processes for hiring, and it is not common for an individual to be the top pick every year across all agencies. Additionally, there is no public record or widely recognized source that supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States"" is false. While it is true that the United States has not had a widespread outbreak of Ebola, there have been cases of Ebola in the United States. For example, in 2014, two healthcare workers in Texas were infected with Ebola after treating a patient who had traveled from West Africa. Additionally, in 2015, a nurse in New Jersey was infected with Ebola after treating a patient who had traveled from West Africa. Therefore, the claim that there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the cost of two days of interest paid to China with the cost of one joint strike fighter (jet). The interest paid to China is a result of the U.S. government's borrowing from China, which is a complex financial transaction. The cost of a joint strike fighter is a significant military expenditure. The claim is comparing two unrelated financial concepts, making it difficult to directly equate them. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that our larger domestic threat is from racial supremacist groups is a complex issue that depends on various factors such as the definition of ""larger"" and the specific context of the threat. While it is true that racial supremacist groups pose a significant threat to public safety and societal harmony, it is also important to consider other domestic threats such as extremist groups, political violence, and cyber threats. Therefore, the claim is not universally true as it simplifies the issue and does not account for other potential threats.

"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not say that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. The negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, and Germany) were focused on Iran's nuclear program, but the approach was to reach a comprehensive agreement that would limit Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, not the dismantling of the sanctions in exchange for dismantling the nuclear program.

"Explanation: The claim that public employees receive something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, the total number of public employees in Rhode Island was approximately 30,000, while the total number of private sector employees was around 350,000. This indicates that public employees make up a smaller percentage of the workforce in Rhode Island, not 25 percent.

"Explanation: The Iran Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was designed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The agreement included strict inspections and limitations on Iran's nuclear activities.

Therefore, the claim that the Iran Deal will facilitate and accelerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Scott Walker's administration did not reduce the state investment in kindergarten education. In fact, during his tenure, Wisconsin increased funding for early childhood education programs. The state's investment in kindergarten and other early education programs has been maintained and even increased in some areas. Therefore, the claim that a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in their education as those that came before them until they are graduating from high school is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you can make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher in Georgia compared to other states is not accurate. Salaries for teachers can vary significantly based on factors such as experience, education, and the specific school district. While some states may offer higher salaries, Georgia's average teacher salary is not significantly higher than the national average. According to the National Education Association, the average salary for a public school teacher in Georgia in the 2020-2021 school year was around $58,000, which is slightly above the national average of $61,320. Therefore, the claim that you can make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher in Georgia is false.

"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama opposed a bill that would have saved Gianna Jessen's life is false. Gianna Jessen is a woman who was born in 1991 and survived a failed abortion attempt. The claim that Obama opposed a bill to save her life is a misinterpretation of events. Obama was not involved in the specific legislation or events surrounding Gianna Jessen's birth and survival. The claim is a part of a broader conspiracy theory that has been debunked by fact-checking organizations.

"Explanation: The claim that the United States is undertaxed compared to its competitors is a complex issue that depends on various factors such as the type of taxes, the tax rates, and the overall tax burden. The U.S. has a relatively low corporate tax rate compared to many other developed countries, but it also has a high effective tax rate due to various deductions and credits. Additionally, the U.S. has a progressive income tax system, which means that higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the U.S. is undertaxed compared to its competitors without considering these nuances.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the Commonwealth Fund, which found that 7.5 million Americans gained access to health care through Medicaid expansion in 2021. This study was conducted by a reputable organization and the numbers are supported by data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: According to the IRS, in 2019, about 44% of Americans did not pay any federal income tax. This is because they either earned less than the standard deduction ($12,550 for a single filer in 2019) or had enough tax credits to offset their tax liability. Therefore, the claim that ""half the Americans don't pay any income taxes"" is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech, including hate speech. However, there are exceptions to this protection, such as when speech incites imminent lawless action or is considered ""fighting words."" Therefore, while hate speech is generally protected, it is not entirely excluded from protection under the First Amendment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the top 1 percent of income-earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government is generally accurate. According to data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various studies, the top 1 percent of income-earners in the United States do indeed contribute a significant portion of federal taxes. For instance, in 2018, the top 1 percent of earners paid approximately 40 percent of all federal income taxes.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of data: deaths from tainted food in the United States and deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), foodborne illnesses cause an estimated 48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths in the United States each year. On the other hand, as of 2021, the total number of U.S. military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began is approximately 7,000. Therefore, the claim that more people were killed in the United States last year by tainted food than U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Marco Rubio requested 37 earmarks worth $43 million in 2002. However, this information is not accurate. Marco Rubio was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, not in 2002. Therefore, he could not have requested earmarks in 2002.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The CARES Act, which is the economic stimulus plan referenced, does not contain any provisions that prohibit students from meeting together in their dorms for religious activities such as prayer groups or Bible studies. The CARES Act primarily focuses on providing financial relief to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it does not impose restrictions on religious gatherings in dormitories.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration notified Poland and the Czech Republic about the cancellation of major missile-defense facilities ""at the last minute in midnight phone calls"" is false. The U.S. missile defense system in Europe, known as the European Phased Adaptive Defense (EPAA), was not canceled by the Obama administration. The system was scaled back in 2013, but this was a planned and gradual process, not a sudden cancellation. The claim of midnight phone calls is also not supported by any credible sources.

"Explanation: The claim that one out of every three automobile fatalities can be attributed to alcohol is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a million people could get health insurance right away if Texas expanded Medicaid under Obamacare is based on a misunderstanding of how Medicaid expansion works. Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) would indeed provide health insurance to many more people in Texas, but the number of people who could get health insurance immediately would depend on various factors, including the state's implementation plan, existing healthcare infrastructure, and the number of people who are eligible but not currently enrolled. The claim of ""a million people"" is an oversimplification and not a precise estimate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Mark Kirk, a former U.S. Senator from Illinois, has not called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that he was fine with Trump's call for mass deportation. These claims are likely misinformation or misattribution.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have specific data on the murder rate in Atlanta for the current year. However, I can provide some context. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the murder rate in Atlanta has been fluctuating over the years, with no clear trend indicating a significant rise in 2023. Without specific data for 2023, it's challenging to definitively say whether the murder rate is on the rise.

"Explanation: The claim that George Allencast was the deciding vote for the 2003 Bush tax cuts is false. George Allencast is not a well-known figure in U.S. politics, and there is no evidence to suggest that he played a role in the 2003 Bush tax cuts. The 2003 tax cuts were passed with bipartisan support, and the deciding votes were cast by members of Congress, not by a figure named George Allencast.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s is a simplification of a complex historical process. While it is true that the Nazi regime implemented policies to disarm and control the German population, the process was gradual and involved various measures, including the registration of firearms, the creation of a national registry, and the eventual prohibition of private ownership of firearms. However, the claim that this disarmament allowed the Nazis to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance is an oversimplification. The Nazi regime's ability to carry out its atrocities was due to a combination of factors, including the regime's control over the police and military, the use of propaganda and terror, and the complicity of many Germans. The disarmament of the German population was one factor among many that contributed to the regime's ability to carry out its evil intentions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was enacted, Florida parents could indeed purchase child-only coverage for their children. However, the ACA did not eliminate this choice; instead, it expanded access to affordable health insurance for children and adults alike. The ACA's consumer protections, such as the requirement for insurers to cover pre-existing conditions and the expansion of Medicaid, have actually increased the availability of affordable health insurance options for Florida residents.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Congress adjourned earliest of any time in congressional history before an election is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Medicaid expansion funding is primarily sourced from the federal government, not from foreign countries like China. The federal government provides the majority of the funding for Medicaid programs, with states contributing a smaller portion. The claim that 46 cents of every dollar for Medicaid expansion is coming from China or another country that doesn't like the U.S. is a misrepresentation of the funding sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Congressman Nye did not vote against a bill that would have defunded the IRS. The IRS is not involved in implementing health care legislation.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Trey Radel, a former Republican congressman from Florida, did not have a driving license revoked or any other legal issue that would prevent him from driving a school bus. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation of his legal troubles, which were unrelated to his driving ability. He was convicted of misdemeanor charges related to a drug possession incident, but this did not affect his ability to drive or hold his seat in Congress.

His proposals focused on expanding background checks, closing loopholes, and addressing mental health issues, but did not include a ban on handguns.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Muslims have been in America since George Washington is false. While there is evidence of Muslims in America before the 20th century, the first significant Muslim presence in the United States began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily with immigrants from the Middle East and South Asia. The first Muslim community in the United States was established in 1893 in Dearborn, Michigan, by immigrants from Lebanon. Therefore, the claim that Muslims have been in America since George Washington is an exaggeration and not historically accurate.

Dan Sullivan served as Alaska's Attorney General from 2014 to 2018, but he did not pass any ""stand your ground"" legislation. The ""stand your ground"" law was already in place in Alaska before his tenure. Additionally, while Sullivan has been a vocal supporter of the Second Amendment, his actions as Attorney General did not involve passing new legislation to protect Second Amendment rights.

"Explanation: The claim that Texas is the second state in the nation for new gun purchases, behind California, is false. According to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data, California has consistently been the top state for firearm background checks, which are often used as a proxy for gun purchases. Texas is typically ranked higher than California in terms of total firearm background checks, but not in the context of new gun purchases specifically.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate in the United States has been declining since 2010, and the poverty rate in 2020 was 9.1%, compared to 12.7% in 2000. Additionally, the claim that productivity has risen 18 percent is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that both Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton had low approval ratings after seven months in office, the claim that only they had worse ratings than President Obama is incorrect.

According to Gallup polls, Obama's approval rating after seven months in office was around 60%, while Ford's was around 40% and Clinton's was around 50%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a misinterpretation of Barack Obama's health care proposal. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama stated that ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" However, this statement was later clarified by the Obama administration to mean that people could keep their existing plans if they chose to do so, but the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would also provide new options for those who did not have coverage or whose plans were inadequate. The claim that people could keep their plans without any changes is a simplification and a misrepresentation of the actual policy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true. The major immigration issue in the UK has indeed involved Poles, Bulgarians, and Romanians, among other EU countries. However, the claim that they were not contributing economically is a generalization and not entirely accurate.

Additionally, the unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is indeed lower than the unemployment rate among Brits, according to various studies and data from the UK Office for National Statistics.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has had a mixed impact on healthcare costs, quality, and access. While the law has expanded access to healthcare for many Americans, it has also led to increased premiums for some individuals and businesses. Additionally, the quality of care can vary widely depending on factors such as location, provider, and insurance plan. Therefore, the claim that ""everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access"" is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Trump's Health Secretary Pick wants a Medicare phaseout by summer 2017 is false. The Health Secretary Pick in question is Tom Price, who was appointed by Trump in 2017.

The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his views.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that health insurance companies deny 1 out of 5 treatments prescribed by doctors is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. While it is true that insurance companies may deny or limit coverage for certain treatments, the rate of denial is not as high as 20%. According to various studies and reports, the denial rate varies but is generally lower. For example, a study by the Health Care Cost Institute found that the denial rate for medical services was around 10% in 2019. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States is no longer the top nation in the globe on infrastructure and has fallen to 15th is based on a report from the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2019. The report ranked the United States 13th in infrastructure quality, which is not the same as being the top nation globally. The claim is therefore misleading as it suggests a more significant drop in ranking than what the report actually indicates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States does not trade as much as other developed nations is not accurate. The United States is one of the largest trading nations in the world. According to the World Bank, the United States had a total trade value of $4.2 trillion in 2020, which is higher than many other developed nations. For example, Germany had a total trade value of $3.7 trillion, and Japan had $2.1 trillion. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Ted Cruz served as the Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008. However, the claim that he was the ""longest-serving solicitor general in the history of Texas"" is false because there have been other individuals who have served in this position for longer periods. For example, Ken Paxton, who is currently the Attorney General of Texas, served as the Solicitor General from 2008 to 2011, which is a longer tenure than Ted Cruz's.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that polls on legalizing same-sex marriage are not dramatically changing is not accurate. In fact, polls have shown a significant shift in public opinion towards supporting same-sex marriage.

"Explanation: The claim that the McCain campaign ""did not elaborate"" on Obama's ties to ACORN is false. In fact, the McCain campaign and other Republican figures did extensively discuss and allege ties between Barack Obama and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). These allegations were a significant part of the 2008 presidential campaign, with McCain and others accusing ACORN of voter fraud and suggesting that Obama had some form of association with the organization. The claim that the McCain campaign did not elaborate on this issue is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the House health care bill. The ""public option"" refers to a government-run health insurance plan that would compete with private insurance companies.

The Milwaukee Police Department has seized around 1,000 firearms in 2022, while the New York City Police Department has seized over 10,000 firearms in the same period. Therefore, the claim that Milwaukee has seized nearly as many firearms as New York City is inaccurate.

"Explanation: Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1989 to 2017, has been criticized for her stance on veterans' issues, including the VA backlog. However, it is important to note that her voting record on this issue is complex and nuanced. While she has voted against some measures aimed at fixing the VA backlog, she has also supported other initiatives to improve veterans' care. Therefore, the claim that she has a ""long record of voting against VA backlog fixes"" is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. does not have a law that commits it to spending 0.7 percent of its gross national product (GNP) on foreign aid. The U.S. does contribute to foreign aid, but the percentage of GNP spent on foreign aid varies and is not fixed at 0.7 percent. The U.S. is one of the largest contributors to foreign aid, but it does not have a specific law mandating a 0.7 percent commitment.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is no significant difference between Donald Trump's immigration policies and those of Congressman Joe Heck. However, this is a simplification and an oversimplification. While both Trump and Heck are Republicans and share some common views on immigration, there are notable differences. For instance, Trump's immigration policies have been more restrictive and controversial, including the construction of a border wall, the travel ban, and the separation of families at the border. Heck, while also a Republican, has been more moderate on immigration issues. Therefore, the claim that there is no policy difference between Trump and Heck is false.

"Explanation: The claim that property insurance rates are going up because Rick Scott signed a bill preventing the state from regulating insurance is not accurate. While it is true that Rick Scott signed a bill that limited the state's ability to regulate insurance rates, the increase in property insurance rates is primarily due to factors such as increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, higher construction costs, and other market-driven factors. The bill itself does not directly cause the increase in rates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by Bill McCollum, a former U.S. Representative from Florida. The statement ""You can't do everything"" is a general statement that does not specifically address mortgage fraud or any other particular issue. It is a common phrase used to acknowledge the limitations of one's abilities or resources. Therefore, the claim is true as it accurately represents a statement made by Bill McCollum.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was indeed created by Congress in 1969, but it was not intended to affect only 155 wealthy Americans. The AMT was designed to ensure that high-income individuals paid at least a minimum amount of tax, regardless of deductions and credits. Over time, due to inflation and changes in tax laws, the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has increased. However, the claim that it was originally intended to affect only 155 taxpayers and that this number has increased to 3.5 million by 2006 is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Russia and China have active human spaceflight programs, there are other nations that also have this capability. For example, the European Space Agency (ESA) has the capability to launch humans into space through its cooperation with the International Space Station (ISS). Additionally, private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have plans to launch humans into space, and SpaceX has already done so with its Crew Dragon spacecraft. Therefore, the claim that Russia and China will be the only nations with this capability is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that someone couldn't take stimulus money because it required ""universal building codes"" is false. The stimulus money, such as the Economic Impact Payments (EIP) provided by the U.S. government, is not contingent on meeting universal building codes. These payments are designed to provide financial relief to individuals and families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are not tied to any specific building or construction requirements.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Almost 10 percent of Canadians came to visit Florida last year"" is not supported by any reliable data source. Additionally, the claim that ""Canadians buy 7.4 percent of our homes in the state"" is not accurate as it does not provide a source or context for this percentage.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), does not entirely trust Iran to inspect itself. The deal includes provisions for international inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify Iran's compliance with the agreement. The IAEA has the authority to inspect Iran's nuclear facilities and monitor its nuclear activities. Therefore, the claim that the Iran deal trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that efforts to remove special diversity status from airport contractors have no impact on the contracts or the city's diversity goals. This claim is false because removing special diversity status typically means that the contractors are no longer given preferential treatment in bidding processes or contract awards. This change can indeed affect the contracts and the city's diversity goals, as it may lead to different contractors being selected based on merit rather than diversity considerations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of women killed by their husbands or boyfriends since September 11, 2001, to the number of Americans killed in the 9/11 attacks and in Afghanistan and Iraq. The claim is false because it is not possible to accurately compare these two figures. The number of women killed by their partners is a statistic that is tracked by various organizations and law enforcement agencies, but it is not a direct comparison to the number of Americans killed in specific conflicts. The number of Americans killed in 9/11 and in Afghanistan and Iraq is a well-documented figure, but it is not comparable to the number of women killed by their partners.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that some Muslim-majority countries have restrictions on the construction of churches and synagogues, it is not accurate to say that this is a universal rule in all Muslim countries. For instance, in countries like Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population, churches and synagogues are allowed and can be found. Similarly, in countries like Turkey, there are churches and synagogues, although their numbers and visibility may vary. The claim also oversimplifies the complex legal and social landscapes of these countries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that award-winning Milwaukee Public Schools teacher Megan Sampson was laid off because Gov. Scott Walker cut state aid to education is false. While it is true that Gov. Scott Walker implemented budget cuts to education during his tenure, there is no evidence to suggest that Megan Sampson was specifically laid off due to these cuts. The claim is a misattribution of the cause of Sampson's layoff.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama said ""when we got bin Laden, terrorism problem solved"" is a misquote. The actual quote from President Obama was ""We have taken a significant step forward in our efforts to protect the American people and to disrupt the terrorist network that attacked us on 9/11."" This statement was made in a press conference after the death of Osama bin Laden, but it did not claim that terrorism was solved. The claim is therefore false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Lloyd Doggett is a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Texas' 10th congressional district. He served from 1995 to 2019. During his tenure, he voted on various pieces of legislation, including healthcare reform, stimulus packages, and cap-and-trade bills. Therefore, the claim that Lloyd Doggett voted for these bills is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. This has been confirmed by multiple official documents, including his birth certificate, which is publicly available. The claim that he was not born in the United States is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked numerous times by fact-checking organizations and official records.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make GSU one of the largest universities in the nation with more than 54,000 students is false. While the merger will indeed combine the student populations of both institutions, the total number of students will not exceed the current enrollment of Georgia State University, which is around 50,000 students. The claim of having more than 54,000 students is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) which found that black and Hispanic applicants were more likely to be denied a mortgage than white applicants with similar credentials. The study found that black applicants were 2.5 times more likely to be denied a mortgage than white applicants, and Hispanic applicants were 1.5 times more likely to be denied a mortgage than white applicants. Therefore, the claim that you are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic is an exaggeration of the findings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of 2021, the United States is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. produced approximately 12.3 million barrels of oil per day in 2021, which is more than any other country. Therefore, the claim that ""America is No. 1 in oil and gas"" is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood) pregnancy services were abortions"" is misleading and inaccurate. According to Planned Parenthood's own data, abortions account for about 3% of their total services. The majority of their services include contraception, cancer screenings, and other preventive health care. The claim likely stems from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""There was no panhandling when I left office"" is a subjective statement and cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence. Panhandling can be a local issue that varies based on time, location, and specific circumstances. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny this claim without more information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While there were demonstrations during the 2005 Social Security debate, the description of the opponents as ""not disruptive crowds"" is an oversimplification. There were indeed protests and some disruption, including booing and heckling, but the claim that opponents were not disruptive crowds is an exaggeration. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was created in 1997, and it is a federal program that provides health coverage to children from low-income families. The number of children covered by CHIP varies by state and year, but it is not accurate to say that 7,000 kids in New Hampshire are covered by CHIP due to a specific individual's efforts. The claim is misleading and does not provide accurate information about the program's impact.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Brian Kemp served as the Secretary of State of Georgia from 2018 to 2022. Prior to this, he served as the Georgia State Representative from 2007 to 2018. Therefore, he has held elected office for a significant period, making him a career politician.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests a correlation between states that passed anti-illegal-immigrant legislation and the number of Hispanic legislators in those states. However, this claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion. It is a general statement that does not necessarily reflect the reality of the situation. The number of Hispanic legislators in a state can be influenced by various factors, including the state's demographics, political climate, and historical context, not just the presence of anti-illegal-immigrant legislation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Expanding Medicaid in Texas would actually improve healthcare options for the most vulnerable. The expansion would provide coverage to more low-income individuals and families, increasing access to healthcare services. This would not worsen healthcare options but rather enhance them. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that unemployment rivals the Great Depression is an exaggeration. While the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in unemployment rates, they did not reach the levels seen during the Great Depression. In the U.S., unemployment peaked at around 14.8% in April 2020, while during the Great Depression, unemployment rates reached over 25%. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Sen. John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was a strong advocate for the U.S. military presence in Iraq. He supported the surge of U.S. troops in 2007 and was critical of the Obama administration's timeline for withdrawal. However, he also emphasized the importance of working with the Iraqi government and respecting the wishes of the Iraqi people. Therefore, the claim that Sen. McCain would occupy Iraq indefinitely against their wishes is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. crude oil production has indeed increased significantly since 2008. In 2008, the U.S. produced about 5.0 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil. By 2021, this had increased to over 11.0 million bpd, a rise of over 80 percent. This is the fastest increase in U.S. history in terms of both percentage and absolute numbers.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that deportations from the interior of the country are way down under President Obama is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the number of deportations from the interior of the country actually increased under President Obama. In 2016, the last full year of his presidency, ICE reported 255,625 deportations from the interior, which was a significant increase from the 2009 figure of 195,000. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Texas economy is about 30 percent larger than Australia's is false. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Texas in 2021 was approximately $1.7 trillion, while Australia's GDP was around $1.4 trillion. This means Texas' economy is about 21.4% larger than Australia's, not 30%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that hair stylists are required to undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants is false. The level of government scrutiny for professionals typically depends on the nature of their work and the potential risks they pose to the public. Hair stylists are regulated by state boards of cosmetology, which oversee their licensing and practice, but this is generally not considered more stringent than the regulations for foreclosure consultants. Foreclosure consultants are regulated by state real estate boards and must adhere to specific laws and regulations, but there is no evidence to suggest that they are subject to more scrutiny than hair stylists.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people is likely an exaggeration. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses (defined as those with fewer than 500 employees) account for 99.7% of all U.S. businesses and employ 47.5% of the private workforce. However, this does not mean that 90% of all workers are employed by companies with fewer than 100 employees. The claim seems to be an overgeneralization.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Thirty-four percent of Hispanics don't have any health care at all, don't have any health insurance"" is based on a specific study or data source. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, approximately 17.9% of Hispanics were uninsured. This figure is significantly lower than the 34% stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: There is no historical evidence to suggest that Abraham Lincoln was a fan of wrestling. While Lincoln was known for his physical strength and enjoyed outdoor activities, wrestling was not a sport he is recorded to have participated in or enjoyed. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a myth.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create a $1,761 yearly energy tax is false. The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which was the cap-and-trade plan proposed by the Obama administration, did not impose a $1,761 yearly energy tax on households. The act aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on emissions and allowing companies to trade permits. The actual impact on energy prices and household costs was complex and varied, but it did not result in a $1,761 yearly tax for all households.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Hillary Clinton's refugee plan is a misrepresentation of her actual policy proposals. Hillary Clinton's plan, as outlined during her 2016 presidential campaign, did not propose to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term. The figure of 620,000 is a fabrication and is not supported by any credible sources. Additionally, the claim that her plan would cost $400 billion in lifetime welfare and entitlement costs is also false. The cost estimates for refugee resettlement programs are significantly lower and are typically funded through a combination of federal and state funds, not through lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific data indicating that Rhode Island is leading the nation in foreclosures. Foreclosure rates can vary significantly by state and are influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, housing market trends, and local policies. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to refer to the latest data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or other reputable real estate market analysis firms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. The law aimed to increase access to health insurance and reduce the number of uninsured Americans. While the ACA did increase government spending, it also generated revenue through taxes and reduced costs through other provisions. The claim that the ACA will add trillions of dollars in debt is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the ACA would reduce the federal deficit by $145 billion over the 2016-2025 period.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Undocumented students who graduate from college can apply for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or other forms of relief, such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which can allow them to work legally in the United States. Additionally, some states and cities have policies that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and other forms of identification, which can help them secure jobs. The claim that they cannot get a job is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the economic impact of stadiums and sports franchises. While there are studies that suggest mixed or negative impacts, it is not accurate to say that ""no consistent, positive impact"" has been found. Some studies have shown positive impacts on local economies, including job creation and increased tax revenues. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the person voted against an increase in the minimum wage in the 1980s is false. The minimum wage in the United States was last increased in 2009, and there have been no significant increases since then. Therefore, it is not possible for the person to have voted against an increase in the minimum wage in the 1980s.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government owns tens of thousands of properties that are vacant or underused is true. According to various reports and studies, the U.S. government does indeed own a significant number of properties that are either vacant or underutilized. For instance, the General Services Administration (GSA) manages a portfolio of federal properties, and it has been reported that a substantial portion of these properties are either vacant or underused. This information is widely documented in various government reports and media outlets.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that representing an ex-boyfriend in a family law case is a common practice for lawyers. While it is possible for a lawyer to represent someone they have a personal relationship with, it is not a regular or common practice due to potential conflicts of interest. Lawyers are generally advised to avoid representing individuals with whom they have a personal or romantic relationship to maintain professional integrity and avoid bias.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you cannot pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes is false. In the United States Senate, a simple majority (51 votes) is required to pass most bills, including budgets. However, certain types of legislation, such as those involving the filibuster, may require a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. But for a budget, a simple majority is sufficient.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not advocate for a freeze on foreclosures during her 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, she proposed a plan to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, which included a ""temporary freeze on foreclosures"" for a period of time. Barack Obama, during his presidency, did not say ""no"" to a freeze on foreclosures. He implemented a program called the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Our pension system is the only one in the country that's 100 percent funded"" is false. In the United States, there are multiple types of pension systems, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, and hybrid plans. Each of these systems has different funding mechanisms and levels of funding. For example, the Social Security system is a defined benefit plan that is funded through payroll taxes, but it is not 100 percent funded. Similarly, many private pension plans are not 100 percent funded. Therefore, the claim that the pension system is the only one that is 100 percent funded is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the introduction of guns into national parks in 2010 led to a significant reduction in violent crimes such as rapes, murders, robberies, and assaults. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim. The National Park Service does not allow guns in national parks, and any changes in crime rates would be influenced by a multitude of factors, not just the presence of guns. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to back up the 85% reduction in crime.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994 is not accurate. While the VAWA has been credited with increasing awareness and providing resources for victims, the overall trend in domestic violence rates has been more complex. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, while there has been a decrease in domestic violence incidents, the rate of decline has not been consistent and has not reached a 50 percent reduction. Additionally, the most recent data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that the rate of intimate partner violence has fluctuated over time, with no clear trend of a 50 percent decrease since 1994.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information that indicates Gerald Daugherty is endorsed by the Austin American-Statesman. Endorsements by major news outlets are typically publicized and can be verified through official statements or press releases. Therefore, without such evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that this claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that under Cuccinellis tax cut plan, school divisions across Virginia could be forced to fire over 8,000 teachers is based on a misinterpretation of the tax cut plan's impact. The tax cut plan proposed by Governor Glenn Youngkin (not Cuccinelli) primarily affects the state's budget, which includes education funding. While the plan could potentially lead to budget cuts, the exact number of teachers that could be affected is not specified and would depend on various factors, including how the budget cuts are allocated. Therefore, the claim that over 8,000 teachers could be fired is an exaggeration and not supported by concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the insurance industry is mostly run by Democrats is not accurate. The insurance industry is a large and diverse sector that includes a wide range of companies and individuals from various political backgrounds. While it is true that some prominent insurance executives or companies may have Democratic leanings, it is not accurate to say that the industry as a whole is predominantly run by Democrats. The insurance industry is influenced by a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory environments, and consumer needs, rather than being primarily driven by political affiliation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Medicare will be gone in eight years if nothing is done is an exaggeration. Medicare's financial status is a complex issue, but it is not expected to run out of money in just eight years. The Medicare Trustees Report for 2021 projects that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted by 2028, but this does not mean Medicare will cease to exist. The program will continue to operate, but at a reduced level of benefits. The claim is therefore false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of 2021, the global solar PV industry employed around 12 million people, while the oil and gas industry employed around 10 million people. However, these numbers are not directly comparable due to differences in the scope of the industries and the methods of counting jobs. The solar industry includes not only direct employment in solar PV but also in related fields like manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. The oil and gas industry includes a wide range of activities from exploration to refining and distribution. Therefore, while the solar industry has a significant number of jobs, it is not accurate to say that there are more jobs in solar than in oil.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry is taking money away from hurricane victims and diverting it to remodel the Governor's Mansion is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, Governor Perry has been criticized for his handling of Hurricane Harvey, but there is no indication that he has redirected funds meant for victims to personal projects.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college is not accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in the 2019-2020 academic year, about 40% of Hispanic students received Pell Grants. This percentage is lower than the 50% stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: George Allen is a former U.S. Senator from Virginia. He served in the Senate from 2001 to 2007. However, he did not run for the U.S. Senate again after his term ended. Therefore, the claim that he is running for U.S. Senate candidacy is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Justin Amash is rated Michigan's No. 1 conservative by National Right to Life is false. While Justin Amash is a conservative Republican and has been a vocal advocate for gun rights, there is no evidence to support the claim that he is rated Michigan's No. 1 conservative by National Right to Life. National Right to Life is a pro-life organization, and their ratings are typically based on a candidate's stance on abortion, not their overall conservatism.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The claim states that 900 people have been fired since they became Secretary, and 60 of those were for manipulating wait times. This claim is not verifiable with the information provided, as it does not specify the time period or provide any sources to back up the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the information given.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is not a government takeover of healthcare. It is a law that expands access to healthcare by requiring most Americans to have health insurance, providing subsidies to help people afford coverage, and expanding Medicaid. It also includes provisions to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The law does not nationalize healthcare or replace private insurance with a government-run system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Obama wants to ""enact the single largest tax increase since the Second World War"" is false. This statement is a misinterpretation of Sen. Obama's proposed tax increases. While Sen. Obama did propose tax increases, the magnitude of these increases was not the largest since the Second World War. The claim is likely a distortion of his policies to create a negative narrative.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: John McCain and George W. Bush had differing views on tax breaks for oil companies. While McCain generally supported reducing tax breaks for oil companies, Bush was more supportive of them. Therefore, the claim that both McCain and Bush favor tax breaks for oil companies is false.

"Explanation: The claim that 1 percent of candidates endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in 2012 won is not accurate. The NRA endorsed a significant number of candidates in 2012, and many of those candidates went on to win their respective elections. The claim of a 1 percent win rate is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual results.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's polling numbers show that he is the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been is false. While Trump did receive a significant portion of the Hispanic vote in 2016, he did not achieve the highest level of support among Hispanics for any Republican presidential candidate. In fact, George W. Bush received a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote in 2004 than Trump did in 2016.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Bruce Starr was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws and greater accountability is not accurate. While Bruce Starr was known for his advocacy for ethics reform, there were other senators who also voted for or supported similar legislation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the rainy day fund has increased by 226 percent since January 2011. To verify this, we need to check the historical data of the rainy day fund. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the rainy day fund, also known as the Budget Stabilization Fund, has indeed grown significantly since 2011. However, the exact percentage increase needs to be calculated based on the fund's balance in January 2011 and its current balance. Without specific data points, it's challenging to confirm the exact 226 percent increase. Therefore, the claim is not definitively true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. David Cicilline, who served as the mayor of Providence from 2010 to 2018, did not make the statement that the city had a world-class school system. In fact, Providence's school system has consistently ranked among the lowest in the country in terms of academic performance. According to various education reports and rankings, Providence's school system has been one of the worst-performing in the United States.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Joe Biden's release of 33 years of tax returns is more than any presidential candidate in history is false. While Biden did release more tax returns than any previous presidential candidate, the claim that it is ""more than any presidential candidate in history"" is an exaggeration. Previous candidates, such as Donald Trump, have also released extensive tax returns, but Biden's release was indeed more comprehensive.

"Explanation: The claim that the word ""progressive"" was created as a substitute for ""communist"" is false. The term ""progressive"" has been used in various contexts since the late 19th century, primarily to describe political and social movements that advocate for reform and change. It was not created as a direct substitute for ""communist."" The term ""communist"" has its own historical and political context, and the two terms are not interchangeable.

"Explanation: The claim states that ""more Georgians have jobs than at any other time since October 2008."" To verify this, we would need to look at the unemployment rate or the number of employed individuals in Georgia from October 2008 to the present. Without specific data, it is not possible to confirm the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on official statistics, it would be true if the current employment rate is higher than the rate in October 2008.

Answer: 1 (assuming the claim is based on official statistics and is true)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Standard & Poor's (S&P) did not say that the United States does not have the ability to repay its debt when they downgraded the U.S. credit rating in 2011. Instead, S&P stated that the U.S. government's ability to manage its debt was impaired by political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling. The downgrade was a result of the political deadlock over raising the debt ceiling, not a statement that the U.S. cannot repay its debt.

"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Rand Paul's 2011 budget included a big cut in the CDC is false. In 2011, Sen. Paul proposed a budget that included cuts to various government programs, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was not significantly impacted. The CDC's budget remained largely unchanged, and the proposed cuts were primarily focused on other areas of the federal budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. would gain revenue by cutting personal income tax rates in half and ending tax breaks is not accurate. Cutting personal income tax rates in half would likely reduce the amount of revenue collected from personal income taxes. Additionally, ending tax breaks would also reduce revenue, as many tax breaks are designed to encourage certain behaviors or provide relief to specific groups. Therefore, the claim that this would result in a gain in revenue is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require taxpayers to pay for abortions. The ACA prohibits federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Virginia's recent intervention, through the passage of a law that prohibits the use of state funds for abortions, does not change the federal law. Therefore, the claim that Virginia taxpayers would have been forced to pay for abortions under Obamacare is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika. To verify this claim, I would need to check the voting records of all candidates and compare their votes on measures related to Zika funding. Without specific information on the votes of other candidates, I cannot definitively say whether Murphy is the only one who voted against every measure to fund Zika.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act was a federal law passed in 2002, but many states had implemented similar education reform initiatives before the federal law was enacted. For example, Texas had a similar law called the Texas Accountability System, which was implemented in 1994. This law aimed to improve schools by setting performance standards and providing resources for struggling schools. The claim suggests that a similar state-level law had a positive impact on schools, which aligns with the general findings of research on such initiatives.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that a certain state was the seventh highest taxed in America, including both state and local taxes. To verify this, I would need to check the most recent data from a reliable source such as the Tax Foundation or the U.S. Census Bureau. However, without specific data, I cannot confirm the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim that stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters is false. The U.S. government's stimulus packages, such as the CARES Act, were designed to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no evidence to suggest that any portion of these funds was specifically allocated to purchase electric cars from Finland or as a form of political payback to Obama supporters.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Allen West called Social Security a Ponzi scheme and said this country has to get on sound footing by destroying it is false. While Allen West has been critical of Social Security and has suggested reforms, he has not explicitly called it a Ponzi scheme or advocated for its destruction. He has, however, proposed changes to the system, such as raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for higher-income individuals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""On eliminating the influence of money in policy campaigns"" is a broad statement that is generally true but not entirely accurate. Money does play a significant role in political campaigns, but there are also many other factors that influence policy campaigns, such as public opinion, media coverage, and grassroots support. Additionally, the elimination of money in policy campaigns is not a feasible or practical solution, as it would likely lead to other forms of influence and potentially undermine the democratic process.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Senator Jim Webb served as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate from 2007 to 2009. He was known for being a centrist Democrat and was not a reliable vote for President Obama or Senator Harry Reid. In fact, Webb was known for his independence and often voted against his party on certain issues. Therefore, the claim that Senator Webb was a reliable vote for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid is false.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that homicides against blacks have tripled since Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law has been in existence is not accurate. While there have been some studies suggesting an increase in homicides involving black victims in Florida, the claim that this increase is tripled is an exaggeration. The ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows individuals to use deadly force if they feel threatened, has been in effect since 2005, but the overall homicide rates and the rates of homicides against blacks have not shown a tripling. The claim is misleading and not supported by reliable data.

"Explanation: The claim states that Pinellas County government downsized and laid off about 1,200 people in a 12 percent unemployment market, and that all of these individuals were rehired after Ms. Latvala went into office in 2000.

"Explanation: The claim that Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell voted for a toll lane on MoPac is false. Mayor Leffingwell was in office from 2011 to 2015, and during his tenure, there were no votes or decisions made regarding toll lanes on MoPac. The current mayor, Steve Adler, has been in office since 2016, and it is unclear if he has voted on this issue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker will be the only economist in the U.S. House. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that the speaker is the only economist in the U.S. House. The House of Representatives typically has a diverse group of members with various backgrounds, including economists. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that the speaker will be the only economist.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ohio Gov. John Kasich got lucky with fracking is a simplification of the complex economic factors that have contributed to Ohio's economic growth. While fracking has played a role in Ohio's economic development, it is not accurate to attribute the state's success solely to ""luck"" or to the actions of a single individual. Ohio's economic growth is the result of a combination of factors, including the state's strategic location, investments in infrastructure, education, and workforce development, as well as the state's efforts to attract and retain businesses.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the Associated Press (AP) called Charlie Crist's attacks ""over the top,"" ""out of context,"" and ""not true."" However, there is no evidence or source provided to support this claim. The Associated Press is a reputable news agency, but it is not known for making such direct evaluations of political statements. Therefore, without a credible source or context, it is not possible to verify the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 7,000 millionaires gamed the system to pay no income taxes is a generalization and lacks specific evidence. While it is true that some wealthy individuals may use legal tax avoidance strategies, such as exploiting loopholes in tax laws, it is not accurate to say that 7,000 millionaires have done so. The number 7,000 is not supported by any credible source, and the claim is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that 90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted is a misrepresentation of the facts. While it is true that the abortion rate for pregnancies with Down syndrome is higher than the general population, the 90 percent figure is an exaggeration. Studies have shown that the abortion rate for pregnancies with Down syndrome is around 60-70 percent, not 90 percent. This claim is often used to argue against abortion rights, but it is important to present accurate information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Steve Jobs was responsible for creating more jobs than the stimulus bill is not accurate. While Steve Jobs was a significant figure in the tech industry and his companies, Apple and Pixar, have created many jobs, the stimulus bill, which was a government initiative to stimulate the economy during the 2008 financial crisis, created a much larger number of jobs. The stimulus bill was designed to provide immediate relief to the economy and create jobs in various sectors, including construction, education, and healthcare. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you cannot destroy guns purchased in a buyback program is false. In many gun buyback programs, the guns are indeed destroyed after being collected. The goal of these programs is to reduce the number of firearms in circulation, and one way to achieve this is by physically destroying the guns. Memphis, like many other cities, has implemented such programs, and the guns collected are typically melted down or otherwise rendered unusable.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that taxpayers pay for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin and 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee is misleading. While it is true that Medicaid, a government-funded health insurance program, covers a significant portion of births in Wisconsin, the claim that taxpayers pay for 45% of all births and 60% of births in Milwaukee is an overstatement. Medicaid covers births for low-income individuals, but it does not cover all births in Wisconsin or Milwaukee. The claim also does not specify that it is referring to Medicaid coverage, which could lead to confusion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not bar the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs) to pay for non-prescription health needs such as aspirin. In fact, the ACA allows for the use of FSAs and HSAs to pay for a wide range of health expenses, including over-the-counter medications, with a prescription from a healthcare provider. This change was made to simplify the use of these accounts and to encourage preventive care.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Patrick Murphy, a former U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, has indeed passed several bills out of committee during his time in Congress. For example, he was a co-sponsor of the ""Veterans' Access, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2015,"" which passed the House of Representatives. Therefore, the claim that he has not passed a single bill out of committee is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin lost 10,000 jobs over the past 12 months, while California lost 1,000,000 jobs. Therefore, Wisconsin did not lose more jobs than any other state over the past 12 months.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State"" is false. New York State has banned hydraulic fracturing (fracking) since 2014, but the state has experienced issues with waste from fracking operations in other states being transported and disposed of in New York. For instance, in 2019, a waste disposal company was fined for improperly disposing of fracking waste in New York. Therefore, the claim that no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplified comparison of tax rates without considering the progressive nature of the tax system. In the United States, for example, the tax rate increases as income increases, but the effective tax rate (the total tax paid as a percentage of income) for higher earners is not necessarily four times that of lower earners. This is because higher earners often have more deductions, credits, and other tax advantages that reduce their effective tax rate. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Secretary of State John Kerry did not support Hamas to the exclusion of the Arab League. In fact, Kerry's visit to Paris and his meeting with Hamas representatives were part of broader efforts to engage with various stakeholders in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including Hamas, to promote peace and stability. The criticism he faced was more about the timing and method of his engagement with Hamas, rather than his support for them to the exclusion of other parties.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific interpretation of the Republicans' alternative health care plan, which is a complex and evolving policy proposal. The statement that insurers will be able to raise premiums four times faster than wages is a simplification and may not accurately reflect the nuances of the plan. The actual impact on premiums and wages would depend on various factors, including the specific provisions of the plan and how they are implemented. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false without more detailed information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by Hart and Risley (1995) which found that children from low-income families hear about 30 million fewer words than children from well-off families by the time they are 3 years old. This study has been widely cited and is considered a significant piece of research in the field of child development. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on an analysis by independent experts, which suggests that Donald Trump's tax plan would increase the national debt by over $5 trillion and could disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy. This claim is supported by various economic analyses and reports from independent think tanks and economists. For instance, the Tax Policy Center and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget have both published analyses indicating that Trump's tax plan would lead to significant increases in the national debt and could disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Democrats do not have a plan for extending the Bush tax cuts is false. In fact, Democrats have proposed various plans to extend or modify the Bush tax cuts, often as part of broader tax reform discussions. For instance, during the Obama administration, there were proposals to extend certain tax cuts for middle-class Americans while allowing others to expire. Additionally, in recent years, there have been discussions and proposals from Democratic lawmakers regarding tax policy, including extensions or modifications of the Bush tax cuts.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government is the largest energy user in the country is false. While the federal government does consume a significant amount of energy, it is not the largest energy user in the country. The largest energy users are typically large corporations, such as those in the manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture sectors. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that in 2020, the residential sector was the largest energy consumer, followed by the commercial sector, and then the industrial sector, which includes large corporations. The federal government's energy consumption is a significant portion of the total, but it is not the largest.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution does not have a residency requirement for presidential candidates.

"Explanation: The claim that ""one out of every three students currently today is ready for college before they go there"" is not supported by any reliable data or studies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that today's marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear is an exaggeration. While it is true that the potency of marijuana has increased over time, the claim of a 300 percent to 800 percent increase is not supported by scientific evidence. The potency of marijuana is typically measured in terms of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content, and while modern strains may have higher THC content than older strains, the increase is generally in the range of 10-20 percent, not 300-800 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the spending of the Democrats in one month to the spending of President Bush over seven years on the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, and Hurricane Katrina. This comparison is misleading because it does not account for the different time frames and the nature of the spending. The spending by the Democrats in one month is likely a fraction of the total spending by President Bush over seven years. Additionally, the spending by the Democrats is likely for different purposes and may not be directly comparable to the spending on wars and natural disasters.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations"" is false.

"Explanation: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's average annual wage growth from 2019 to 2021 was 3.5%, which is slightly below the national average of 3.7%. Similarly, Wisconsin's job growth rate from 2019 to 2021 was 1.5%, which is also slightly below the national average of 1.8%. Therefore, the claim that Wisconsin is below the national average in wage growth and job growth is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that people who are unemployed and give up looking for jobs are suddenly considered employed, which is not accurate. Unemployment rates are calculated based on people who are actively seeking work. If someone stops looking for work, they are no longer considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate. Therefore, the claim is misleading and false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that of the 25 wealthiest nations, the United States is the only one that doesn't provide basic health coverage. This is a false statement. While it is true that the United States does not have a universal healthcare system like many other developed countries, it is not accurate to say that it is the only wealthy nation without such a system. For example, some wealthy nations like Switzerland and Singapore have healthcare systems that are not fully universal but still provide significant coverage.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney supported a law that could have made most common forms of birth control illegal is false. During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney did support a law that would have allowed states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, but this law did not make most common forms of birth control illegal. Instead, it would have allowed employers to refuse to cover contraception if it went against their religious beliefs. The claim is misleading and exaggerates Romney's position.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the most significant driver of out-migration from Rhode Island is the estate tax is not accurate. While estate taxes can be a factor in some cases, they are not the primary driver of out-migration. Other significant factors include economic opportunities, cost of living, and quality of life. Additionally, Rhode Island's estate tax is not particularly high compared to other states, and it does not apply to all estates. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Scott Walker's school-aid cuts being so devastating that students are without chairs and a government survey found 47 kids in a classroom is false. While Scott Walker, as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, did implement budget cuts that affected schools, there is no evidence to support the specific claims made in the statement. The claim about students being without chairs and the government survey finding 47 kids in a classroom are not supported by credible sources.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not released any new estimates that conclude the final price-tag for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will exceed $2 trillion more than double what was initially reported.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the CBO's findings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in 2019, the top 1% of Americans paid 40.1% of the income taxes, while the bottom 50% paid 3.1%. The claim that 5% of Americans pay over half the income taxes is incorrect. Additionally, the claim that 40% of Americans pay no income taxes is also incorrect. The IRS data shows that in 2019, 44.5% of Americans did not pay any income tax, but this is due to various factors such as income below the taxable threshold, tax credits, and deductions.

"Explanation: The claim states that Connecticut takes on slot machines at a rate of 25 cents on the dollar and that the state takes on table games at a rate of zero. This claim is false. In Connecticut, the tax rate for slot machines is 25%, not 25 cents on the dollar. Additionally, the state does take a percentage of table game revenue, but it is not zero. The correct tax rates are 25% for slot machines and 10% for table games.

While it is true that the Obama administration used the Espionage Act more frequently than previous administrations, the claim that it was more than all previous administrations combined is an exaggeration. The Espionage Act was used to prosecute several individuals who leaked information to journalists, but the claim that it was used more than all previous administrations combined is not supported by historical data.

"Explanation: The claim that Nevada has been recently ranked No. 1 in unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy, and divorce is false. While Nevada has faced significant economic challenges in recent years, it has not been ranked No. 1 in all these categories. For instance, Nevada has had high unemployment rates, but it has not been ranked No. 1 in unemployment. Similarly, while Nevada has had high foreclosure rates, it has not been ranked No. 1 in foreclosures. The same applies to violent crime, personal bankruptcy, and divorce rates. These rankings are often based on national surveys and reports, and Nevada's rankings in these categories are not consistently at the top.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the annual deaths from tobacco to the total deaths from World War II, AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide, and suicide combined. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tobacco use is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States. The total deaths from World War II in the U.S. were approximately 400,000. The combined deaths from AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide, and suicide are significantly lower than the deaths from tobacco. Therefore, the claim is true.

Carpet bombing is a military strategy that involves dropping a large number of bombs over a wide area, often resulting in significant civilian casualties. This strategy is widely condemned due to its indiscriminate nature and the high risk of civilian casualties. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible evidence or official statement from Donald Trump or his administration indicating that he plans to use carpet bombing in the Middle East. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of his policies or statements.

"Explanation: The claim is about the allocation of funds in the United States, specifically mentioning pork barrel projects and earmark projects. Pork barrel projects are a form of political corruption where government funds are allocated to benefit specific individuals or groups, often in exchange for political support. Earmark projects are specific projects or programs that are funded by the government. The claim suggests that $20 billion was spent on these projects and that some of this money could have been used for bridge inspections instead. However, the claim does not provide any specific sources or evidence to support the $20 billion figure or the suggestion that the money could have been used differently. Therefore, without concrete evidence or sources, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

"Explanation: The claim that Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years is not accurate. Medicare's financial status is a complex issue, but it is not expected to become insolvent in the near future. The Medicare Trustees Report, released annually, provides projections about Medicare's financial status. According to the 2021 report, Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is expected to be depleted in 2026, but this does not mean Medicare will be bankrupt. The program will continue to operate, but at a reduced level of benefits. Additionally, the report also notes that the Medicare program is expected to remain solvent through 2030 if certain changes are made to the program.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn laws passed by Congress, and it has done so in the past. For example, in 1954, the Supreme Court struck down the ""separate but equal"" doctrine in Brown v. Board of Education, which was a significant majority decision by Congress. Therefore, the claim that it would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step is not accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is about the opposition to a specific war, which is the Iraq War. The Iraq War began in 2003 and lasted until 2011. The claim states that the person opposed the war in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. However, the war did not start until 2003, and the person's opposition to the war would have been relevant from 2003 onwards. Therefore, the claim that the person opposed the war in 2002 is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. State Department did not spend $630,000 to get 2 million Facebook Likes. The State Department has used social media to promote its messages, but the specific claim about spending $630,000 for Facebook Likes is not accurate.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that jobs involving the minimum wage are overwhelmingly for young people starting out in the workforce is not entirely accurate. While it is true that many entry-level jobs, which often pay minimum wage, are held by young people, there are also many adults and even older workers who hold these jobs. These jobs can include retail, food service, and other service industries. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is known to have been critical of the Iraq War.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the City of Milwaukee uses the building inspection area as a revenue base is false. Building inspections are typically conducted to ensure the safety and compliance of buildings with local codes and regulations, and they are not primarily used as a revenue source.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that by simply inflating tires and getting regular tune-ups, we could save all the oil that is being discussed in the context of drilling. This claim is misleading because while proper tire inflation and regular tune-ups can help improve fuel efficiency and reduce oil consumption, they are not a significant enough factor to save all the oil that is being discussed in the context of drilling. Drilling for oil is a complex process that involves significant energy and resource inputs, and the amount of oil that can be saved through tire inflation and tune-ups is minimal compared to the total oil consumption and drilling activities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit organization that tracks abortion policy, there have been 555 abortion restrictions enacted in the United States since 2019.

"Explanation: The claim is partially true but contains inaccuracies and misinterpretations. Here's a breakdown:
- **Iraq**: The claim that Obama left troops in Iraq and they are being more successful is true. Obama did leave a residual force in Iraq after withdrawing most troops in 2011, and the situation has improved since then.
- **Afghanistan**: The claim that Obama boosted the effort in Afghanistan is also true. Obama increased troop levels in Afghanistan after taking office, and the U.S. military presence there was significant during his presidency.
- **Guantanamo**: The claim that Obama did not close Guantanamo is false. While he did not close the detention facility during his presidency, he did attempt to close it and transferred many detainees to other facilities. The closure was blocked by Congress.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law"" is a generalization that is not supported by specific data or evidence. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was signed into law in 2010, and while it has had various impacts on the economy and healthcare, it is not accurate to say that businesses have created jobs every single month since its implementation. Job creation can vary significantly from month to month due to numerous factors, and it is not accurate to attribute all job creation to a single piece of legislation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that MSNBC went off the air for behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with the revelation that Michael Brown was a suspect in a robbery is false. There is no credible evidence or reports to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted 8% unemployment until 2014. However, the CBO's official reports and projections do not support this claim. The CBO's unemployment rate projections for 2014 were significantly lower than 8%. For instance, in their January 2014 report, the CBO projected the unemployment rate to be around 6.7% in 2014. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

These funds are typically used to purchase food, equipment, and supplies for school cafeterias.

"Explanation: The claim about a ""staggering drop-out rate of almost 61 percent"" for Miami-Dade and Broward counties is false. According to the Florida Department of Education, the dropout rate for Miami-Dade County in the 2019-2020 school year was 10.5%, and for Broward County, it was 11.3%. These rates are significantly lower than the claimed 61%.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that every time taxes have been cut, revenues have gone up and the economy has grown is a simplification of complex economic phenomena. While tax cuts can stimulate economic growth in the short term, they can also lead to reduced government revenue, which can negatively impact public services and infrastructure. Additionally, the impact of tax cuts on revenue and economic growth can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances, such as the size of the tax cut, the economic conditions at the time, and the composition of the tax base. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time taxes have been cut, revenues have gone up and the economy has grown.

While President Obama did discuss the possibility of a limited military strike on Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons, he did not use the term ""pinprick.""

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Pell Bridge, also known as the Pell Island Bridge, is a bridge that connects the mainland to Pell Island in Maine, USA. It is primarily used for commuter traffic, as it is a vital link for residents of the island and the mainland. While it does attract some tourists due to its scenic views and the historic nature of the island, its primary function is not tourism but rather commuting. Therefore, the claim that the Pell Bridge is essentially a tourism bridge and not a commuter bridge is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Colorado food stamp recipients can use ATMs to get cash to buy marijuana is false. Food stamp benefits in Colorado, like in many other states, are intended to purchase food and other essential items. The benefits are typically loaded onto an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which can be used at participating retailers to purchase eligible items. However, these benefits cannot be used to purchase cash or non-food items like marijuana. Additionally, there is no provision for using ATMs to withdraw cash specifically for marijuana purchases.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Republicans stood on the sidelines when Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid were created is false. In fact, many key figures in the creation of these programs were Republicans. For example, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, proposed Social Security in 1935, but it was Republicans who played a significant role in its passage through Congress. Similarly, Medicare was created under President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, but the legislation was supported by a bipartisan coalition in Congress, including many Republicans. Medicaid was created under President Richard Nixon, a Republican, and was supported by a bipartisan coalition in Congress.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which found that gun violence is the leading cause of death for young African American men. The study reported that gun violence accounted for 50% of deaths among African American men aged 15-34, while the next nine causes of death combined accounted for 40%. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that violent crime is lower in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is a topic of ongoing debate and research. Studies on the relationship between gun laws and crime rates have produced mixed results. Some studies suggest that states with more permissive gun laws have higher rates of violent crime, while others find no significant correlation or even a slight decrease in crime rates. The claim is not universally accepted and is subject to interpretation based on the specific studies and methodologies used.

"Explanation: The claim that Kendrick Meek was named one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a nation is the ""most highly taxed"" can be subjective and depends on the specific taxes being considered (e.g., income tax, sales tax, property tax, etc.). However, as of my last update in October 2023, the country with the highest overall tax burden is typically considered to be Sweden. Sweden has a high tax rate, with a top income tax rate of around 57.5% and a comprehensive tax-to-GDP ratio of approximately 45%. Therefore, the claim that a nation is the ""most highly taxed"" is generally true when referring to Sweden.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The total value of platinum in the world is significantly less than the U.S. national debt. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt was approximately $28 trillion, while the total value of platinum in the world is estimated to be around $100 billion. Therefore, even if you took every ounce of platinum in the world, it would not be enough to pay down the U.S. national debt.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In Oregon, minors under the age of 18 cannot consent to sterilization without parental consent. The Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) 40.700.010 states that a minor cannot consent to sterilization without the consent of a parent or guardian. Therefore, the claim that girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan is false. The U.S. government does not have a specific plan for a zombie apocalypse. While there are contingency plans for various emergencies, including natural disasters and public health crises, there is no evidence to suggest that the government has allocated resources specifically for a zombie apocalypse scenario. This claim is a humorous or satirical exaggeration, not a factual statement.

"Explanation: Rob Portman, a former U.S. Senator and current U.S. Trade Representative, has been criticized for his role in trade policies that some argue have led to job losses in the Mahoning Valley and other regions. However, the claim that he ""sucked the jobs out of the Mahoning Valley and sent them to China"" is an oversimplification and lacks specific evidence. While Portman's policies may have contributed to job losses, it is not accurate to attribute all of these losses solely to him. The claim also ignores the complex interplay of global economic factors, technological advancements, and other domestic policies that have influenced job markets.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson wore a T-shirt stating ""We Stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen"" is false.

"Explanation: The claim that ending federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) would jeopardize 9,000 jobs is based on a 2019 report by the NPR that stated that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if federal funding were to be eliminated. However, this report was a projection and not a guarantee. The actual impact on jobs would depend on various factors, including the ability of NPR to secure alternative funding sources and the specific circumstances of the job market. Therefore, while the claim is based on a real report, it is not necessarily accurate to say that 9,000 jobs would be jeopardized.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Florida Insurance Commissioner, David Altman, has been actively involved in negotiating lower rates and advocating for consumers under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). He has been critical of the federal government's handling of the healthcare law and has worked to ensure that Floridians have access to affordable healthcare options. Therefore, the claim that Florida refused to allow the insurance commissioner to negotiate lower rates or refuse rates that are too high is inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim that Georgia's CRCT (Criterion-Referenced Competency Test) sets some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation is not accurate. The CRCT is a standardized test used in Georgia to measure student achievement in various subjects.

The expectations and proficiency levels are set by the Georgia Department of Education and are based on state standards, which are comparable to those in other states.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""He's been endorsed by 'every major newspaper here in the state of Texas'"" is highly unlikely to be true. Endorsements from ""every major newspaper"" would be a significant achievement and would typically be widely reported and verified.

Without this specific data, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

- Montclair State University: 50.1%
- New Jersey City University: 27.3%
- Stockton College: 27.3%
- Rowan University: 51.3%
- William Paterson University: 55.1%

Only Montclair State University and William Paterson University have graduation rates above 50% within four years. Therefore, the claim that all of these universities graduate less than 50% of their students within four years is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Scott's sale of the state planes was not proper is a complex issue that depends on the specific circumstances and legal interpretations. Without detailed information about the sale, such as the process followed, the reasons for the sale, and any legal challenges or investigations, it is difficult to definitively determine the validity of the claim. However, if there are specific allegations of impropriety, such as conflicts of interest, lack of transparency, or violations of state procurement laws, then the claim could be true.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be definitively judged as true without more information.)"
"Explanation: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is ""job killing"" is a complex issue that has been debated extensively. Some studies suggest that the ACA may have led to a reduction in full-time employment, particularly among low-wage workers, due to the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees. However, other studies and analyses have shown that the overall impact on employment is minimal or even positive, with the ACA providing access to health insurance for millions of Americans who previously did not have it. Therefore, the claim that the ACA is ""job killing"" is not universally accepted and is subject to interpretation based on the specific data and studies one chooses to consider.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly prohibit someone from running for Congress simultaneously in multiple states. The Constitution does not address the issue of dual candidacies, leaving it to state laws and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to regulate such situations. However, the FEC has rules that can affect dual candidacies, such as the requirement to file a Statement of Candidacy in each state where one is running. Therefore, while the Constitution does not prevent it, practical and regulatory considerations may make it difficult or impossible to run for Congress in multiple states simultaneously.

In fact, she was a strong supporter of Medicare and voted against any legislation that would have significantly weakened or dismantled the program.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The fiscal cliff agreement, which was reached in early 2013, included a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. While it did result in significant tax increases, it is not accurate to say that it was the largest tax increase in history.

"Explanation: Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. During his presidency, he was heavily involved in national security affairs, including decisions on military operations, intelligence, and foreign policy.

Therefore, the claim that Obama ""has no experience or background at all in national security affairs"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that White House spokesman Robert Gibbs lied when he said President Obama's birth certificate is posted on the Internet is false. In 2011, President Obama released his long-form birth certificate to address persistent rumors about his citizenship.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes a provision for end-of-life counseling, but it is entirely voluntary. The provision, known as the ""Five Questions"" or ""Five Wishes,"" is designed to help patients discuss their end-of-life preferences with their healthcare providers. However, patients are not required to participate in this counseling, and it is not a mandatory part of the healthcare reform bill.

"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by John McCain's top lobbyist, Tony Blankley, during the 2000 presidential campaign. Blankley did indeed say, ""The American people won't care about this,"" when asked about the hiring of lobbyists for McCain's campaign. This statement was reported in various news outlets at the time, including The Washington Post and The New York Times. Therefore, the claim is true.

Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""For every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion"" is a misrepresentation of the actual data. According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2017, 34% of women who visited Planned Parenthood health centers for abortion services received an abortion. This means that the majority of women who visit Planned Parenthood for abortion services do not receive an abortion, and the claim that 32 out of 33 women receive an abortion is a significant exaggeration.

This claim is false because it is not possible for 37 percent of the students to be ineligible if they are already receiving free or reduced-price lunches. The percentage of ineligible students should be less than 100 percent, and the claim suggests that a significant portion of the students are receiving the wrong type of assistance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: President Obama did not campaign on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan. While he did support and sign into law the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which included provisions for reproductive health care, this was not the primary focus of his campaign. His campaign platform emphasized issues like healthcare reform, economic recovery, and ending the Iraq War.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The House of Representatives has indeed sued a sitting president in U.S. history. In 1998, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Bill Clinton, accusing him of perjury and obstruction of justice. Although he was acquitted by the Senate, this is a clear example of the House suing a sitting president.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Kasich's trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs, specifically 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China, is not accurate. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of trade data. Trade deals can lead to job losses in certain sectors, but they also create new jobs in other sectors. The specific numbers provided are not supported by reliable sources or economic data. The claim is misleading and not based on factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Jon Corzine, a former Senator, was subpoenaed to testify before the Senate, it is not the first time in history that a former Senator has been subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues. There have been numerous instances of former Senators being called to testify before the Senate in the past.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the person never supported the federal health care individual mandate is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes an individual mandate that requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. The person in question, Donald Trump, has publicly stated his opposition to the ACA and the individual mandate, but he did not support the mandate when it was first implemented.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of data from a study by the Federal Reserve. The study found that the top 400 wealthiest Americans have more wealth than the bottom 50% of Americans combined. However, this does not mean that the top 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans. The bottom 50% includes the top 400 Americans, so the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida had five sanctuary cities while Jeb Bush was governor is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no official record or widely accepted information that supports the claim that Florida had five sanctuary cities during Jeb Bush's tenure as governor. Sanctuary cities are typically defined as cities that have policies in place to limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, and the number of such cities in Florida has been a subject of debate and misinformation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the timing of the announcement for the president is vague and does not provide specific details or context. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Pell Grants were first introduced in 1972, and by 1976, they were fully funded. In 1976, a full Pell Grant covered 72% of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college. Over the years, the purchasing power of Pell Grants has decreased due to inflation and changes in the cost of attendance. In the 2021-2022 academic year, a full Pell Grant covered 34% of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that 17 intelligence agencies have concluded that cyberattacks on U.S. elections come from the highest levels of the Kremlin is a complex issue. While it is true that multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed cyberattacks to Russian actors, including those linked to the Russian government, the claim that these attacks are ""designed to influence our election"" is more nuanced. The intelligence community has reported that Russian actors interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but the extent to which these actions were specifically designed to influence the election rather than other activities is a matter of ongoing debate and investigation.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or misleading as it simplifies and generalizes the intelligence community's findings.)"
"Explanation: The claim about Andrew Cuomo creating 500 jobs at a cost of $1.5 million per job in the SolarCity project is misleading and likely false. The SolarCity project in Buffalo, which was announced in 2017, was intended to create 3,000 jobs, not 500. Additionally, the cost per job figure of $1.5 million is not accurate and seems to be an exaggeration. The actual cost per job for such projects is typically much lower.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence that former President Barack Obama made this statement. The claim appears to be a misattribution of a statement made by another politician or a fabrication. Additionally, the claim is not supported by any official records or statements from the Obama administration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which reports that 30.4% of Texas college students graduate within four years and 58.1% graduate within six years.

"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, Nancy Pelosi, and Al Gore are all prominent political figures in the United States, but they have not collaborated on global warming. Newt Gingrich is known for his skepticism about climate change, while Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore are both prominent advocates for addressing global warming. Therefore, the claim that they have teamed up on global warming is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Senate immigration bill would result in a population increase of over 70 million people in 20 years is an exaggeration and not supported by the actual provisions of the bill. The Senate immigration bill, known as the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, aims to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the U.S., increase the number of refugees admitted, and reform the visa system. While it does increase the number of immigrants, the projected population increase is not as dramatic as the claim suggests. Estimates from various sources, including the Migration Policy Institute, suggest that the bill would increase the U.S. population by several million over the next 20 years, but not by 70 million.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama ""shunned the opportunity to talk to soldiers to thank them for their service"" is false. In fact, President Obama made several visits to military bases and troops during his presidency to express his gratitude and support. For example, he visited troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations to thank them for their service and to discuss the ongoing operations. These visits were widely reported in the media and are documented in historical records.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there are pipes carrying natural gas in this country made of wood is false. Natural gas pipelines are typically made of materials like steel, plastic, or composite materials, not wood. Wood is not suitable for this purpose due to its susceptibility to rot, insects, and other environmental factors that could compromise the integrity of the pipeline.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney says ""class sizes don't matter"" is false. Mitt Romney has publicly stated that class size does matter and that reducing class sizes can improve educational outcomes. For example, in a 2012 presidential debate, Romney mentioned that reducing class sizes can help teachers provide better instruction. Therefore, the claim is a misrepresentation of Romney's actual stance on the issue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator and former presidential candidate. The statement suggests that Cruz's TV ad about John Kasich was a lie and that stations had to pull it off the air. However, there is no specific evidence provided to support this claim, and it is not widely reported that such an incident occurred. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""My office sends federal money back every year"" is false. Federal money, such as tax refunds, is typically sent to individuals or businesses based on their tax returns and is not something that an office would ""send back"" annually. The process involves the IRS calculating the amount of tax owed or refundable and then sending the appropriate amount to the taxpayer.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that there are over 25 million people living in Texas and less than 2 percent of them have concealed handgun licenses. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, as of 2021, there are approximately 25.1 million people living in Texas. The Texas Department of Public Safety also reports that as of 2021, there are about 1.6 million active concealed handgun licenses in Texas. To verify the claim, we can calculate the percentage of people with concealed handgun licenses:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of concealed handgun licenses}}{\text{Total population}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1,600,000}{25,100,000} \right) \times 100 \approx 6.37\% \]

Since 6.37% is greater than 2%, the claim that less than 2 percent of Texans have concealed handgun licenses is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) which estimated that reducing pay and benefits for federal employees could save $103 billion over 10 years. However, this figure is not a direct savings but rather a projection based on various scenarios and assumptions. Additionally, the claim that this would amount to more than $50,000 per worker is misleading as it does not specify the number of workers or the distribution of the savings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the person is the ""first Aggie governor of Texas"" is not verifiable with the information provided. The term ""Aggie"" typically refers to graduates of Texas A&M University, but without specific details about the person's name, term in office, and their connection to Texas A&M, it is impossible to confirm this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's collective-bargaining limits and their impact on the city of Milwaukee's budget. Walker implemented collective-bargaining limits in 2011, which restricted public employees' collective bargaining rights. These changes were part of a broader effort to reduce government spending and balance the state's budget. However, the specific impact on the city of Milwaukee's budget is not directly stated in the claim, and the claim does not provide any evidence or context to support the assertion that these limits helped balance the city's budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey's public school students have the best Advanced Placement (AP) scores in the nation is not accurate. While New Jersey does have a strong education system and its students often perform well on AP exams, it is not accurate to say that they have the best scores in the nation. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the 30 percent set aside for affordable housing in urban renewal areas is calculated citywide, not district by district. This claim is false because the 30 percent requirement is typically applied on a project-by-project basis, rather than being a citywide average. Each project within an urban renewal area must meet the 30 percent affordable housing requirement, but the overall citywide percentage can vary based on the specific projects and their locations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, it did not grant personhood status to the preborn. The Dobbs decision merely held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, leaving the issue to the states. The claim that this is the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn is incorrect because there have been other cases and laws that have recognized fetal personhood in various forms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Republican candidates in Oregon are advocating violence against gays is a false statement. There is no evidence to support this claim, and it is a misrepresentation of the political views and actions of Republican candidates in Oregon. Republican candidates, like any other political candidates, may have differing views on various issues, but advocating violence is not a part of their platform or any credible political discourse.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""the debt will soon eclipse our entire economy"" is a broad and vague statement that lacks specific context or data. It is not possible to accurately assess the truth of this claim without knowing which economy is being referred to, what time frame is being considered, and what specific debt is being discussed. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests a correlation between gains in Atlanta Public Schools scores on a national standardized test and dramatic score increases on state tests. However, correlation does not imply causation. Gains on a national standardized test do not necessarily indicate that the same improvements will be reflected on state tests. The two tests may have different formats, content, or scoring systems, and improvements on one do not guarantee improvements on the other. Therefore, the claim is not necessarily true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: A ""no-tax pledge"" is a political promise made by a candidate or politician to not raise taxes. This pledge is often used in political campaigns to attract voters who are opposed to tax increases. However, it is important to note that such pledges can be made without any legal or binding force, and politicians may still raise taxes after being elected if they believe it is necessary for their policy goals. Therefore, the claim that signing a no-tax pledge is a binding legal commitment is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the number-one source of illegal immigration is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population is not accurate. While it is true that some individuals overstay their visas, the majority of illegal immigrants enter the country through the southern border without proper documentation. According to the U.S. Border Patrol, the majority of apprehensions at the southern border are of individuals who do not have valid entry documents. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security reports that the number of overstays has been decreasing in recent years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Al Qaeda has camps with the drug cartels in Mexico. While it is true that Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have attempted to establish links with drug cartels for funding and operational purposes, there is no specific evidence of Al Qaeda having camps or bases in Mexico in collaboration with drug cartels. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the broader issue of transnational criminal networks.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Romneycare (Massachusetts Health Care Reform) sent costs spiraling out of control and hiking premiums is not accurate. While there were initial increases in premiums, the overall impact of Romneycare was to reduce the number of uninsured residents and improve access to healthcare. A study by the Commonwealth Fund found that the uninsured rate in Massachusetts dropped from 10.9% in 2006 to 2.7% in 2015, and the state's health insurance market remained stable. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) built upon Romneycare's framework, and the ACA's implementation has been associated with a reduction in premiums for many Americans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that Seneca Jones Timber Co. has shifted to using second-generation trees and that most mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years. While it is possible for companies to shift their practices, the claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the statement that ""most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years."" Without concrete data or references, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible source indicating that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has proposed a budget that includes selling off Wisconsin's state parks. Walker's budget proposals typically focus on other areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, but there is no evidence to suggest that selling off state parks is part of his agenda.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, the process for selecting delegates to the Republican National Convention is determined by state party rules and does not involve the chairman of the party appointing delegates. Instead, delegates are typically selected through a process of primaries, caucuses, or other state-specific methods. The chairman of the party may have influence, but they do not have the authority to appoint delegates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a specific quote made by someone on live TV. Without specific context or verification, it's challenging to confirm the authenticity of the quote.

Without additional information, it's difficult to definitively judge the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim ""On sharing power with Republicans"" is vague and does not provide specific details or context.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a television ad, which is a source of information that can be biased or inaccurate. Without specific details or evidence from a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the claim. Additionally, the claim mentions ""allegations"" without specifying the source of these allegations or providing any evidence to support them. Therefore, the claim cannot be independently verified as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Perry failed to involve border sheriffs in developing plans to prevent violence in their communities is false. In fact, Gov. Rick Perry has been actively involved in working with local law enforcement, including border sheriffs, to address border security and violence. He has supported initiatives such as the Secure Texas Task Force, which includes representatives from various law enforcement agencies, including border sheriffs. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 14, 1935. At that time, the average life expectancy for men was around 59 years and for women around 62 years. However, the claim incorrectly states that the age expectancy for the average man was 58 and for women was 62. The correct figures are 59 and 62, respectively.

"Explanation: The claim that former Clinton budget director Alice Rivlin said the stimulus bill ""won't actually stimulate the economy"" is false. Alice Rivlin has publicly stated that she supports the stimulus bill and believes it is necessary to help the economy. She has also criticized those who argue against it. Therefore, the claim that she said the stimulus bill won't stimulate the economy is a misrepresentation of her actual views.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was a significant piece of legislation passed in 2010. It aimed to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance, expand Medicaid, and reduce the number of uninsured Americans. The claim about support for the Affordable Care Act can vary depending on the specific context and the time period being discussed. However, as of my last update in October 2023, the ACA has had varying levels of support and opposition from different political parties and the public. The support for the ACA has been a contentious issue, with some people praising its provisions and others criticizing it.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true, as the Affordable Care Act has had support from various groups and individuals, although the level and nature of this support have varied over time.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Tim Kaine, a former U.S. Senator and Governor of Virginia, has been accused of appointing a radical jihadi to the Virginia Immigration Commission. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The individual in question, Ali Al-Akhras, is a Muslim community activist and has been involved in various community initiatives, but there is no evidence to suggest that he is a ""radical jihadi"" or that he was appointed to the commission in exchange for campaign contributions. The claim appears to be a misinformation campaign.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we are experiencing the worst economic recovery America has ever had is subjective and depends on the specific metrics and timeframes used for comparison. While the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant economic disruption, the recovery has been swift in many ways, with the U.S. economy rebounding quickly after the initial downturn. However, it's important to note that the recovery has been uneven, with some sectors and regions recovering more slowly than others. Therefore, the claim that it is the ""worst"" recovery is not universally accepted and depends on the perspective and criteria used for evaluation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the individual has proposed the largest employer contribution to the Virginia Retirement System in history.

"Explanation: The claim states that New Jersey's job growth in May represents 25 percent of all the jobs created in the country. To verify this, we need to compare the number of jobs created in New Jersey with the total number of jobs created in the United States. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, New Jersey added 10,000 jobs in May 2023, while the United States added 375,000 jobs in the same period. To find the percentage, we calculate (10,000 / 375,000) * 100 = 2.66%. This is significantly less than 25%, so the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Obama in 2010. The primary goal of the ACA was to increase access to affordable health insurance for Americans. While the law has had mixed results, it has indeed brought down the costs for many Americans through various provisions such as subsidies for low- and middle-income individuals, expansion of Medicaid, and the requirement for insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. Therefore, the claim that ""President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs for average Americans"" is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. A trade war, which involves countries imposing tariffs or other barriers to trade with each other, can indeed have significant economic impacts. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which was implemented during the Great Depression, is often cited as an example of how protectionist trade policies can exacerbate economic downturns. The act led to a significant increase in tariffs, which reduced international trade and contributed to the length and severity of the Great Depression.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that China is practicing how to blow up our satellites is a misinterpretation of a real event. In 2021, China conducted an anti-satellite (ASAT) test, which involved the destruction of one of its own satellites. This test was not directed at any other country's satellites, including those of the United States. The test was condemned internationally due to the creation of space debris and the potential threat to other satellites. The claim that China is practicing to blow up our satellites is false and misleading.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) is a non-profit organization that advocates for lower taxes. Their pledge typically relates to opposing new taxes or advocating for tax cuts. However, the claim that the ATR pledge relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action is not accurate. The ATR's pledge is more about opposing new taxes rather than supporting them. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sarah Palin supports ""aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife"" is false. While Sarah Palin has been known to support hunting and has advocated for certain hunting practices, there is no evidence to suggest that she specifically supports aerial hunting of wolves or other wildlife.

The amount a couple contributes to Medicare over their lifetimes is not a fixed number, and the benefits they receive are also not a fixed amount.

"Explanation: The claim that ninety percent of the job growth in Virginia has been in the private sector is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the majority of job growth in Virginia has been in the private sector, but it is not as high as ninety percent.

"Explanation: The claim about Rhode Island having the worst maintained bridges and the second worst maintained roads in the United States is not accurate. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2021 Infrastructure Report Card, Rhode Island's bridges are in fair condition, with a grade of C-. While the state's roads are in poor condition, with a grade of D-, it is not the second worst in the country. Alaska has the worst maintained roads, with a grade of D-, and Rhode Island ranks 40th in the nation for road conditions. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a specific database used by police to look up wanted suspects excludes certain warrants issued by Atlanta Municipal Court.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin road signs have always been made in Wisconsin and that Scott Walker is outsourcing them to an out-of-state company and paying more money for them is false. Wisconsin has indeed historically produced road signs within the state, but there have been instances where the state has outsourced the production to other states or companies. However, the claim that Scott Walker specifically did this and paid more money for them is not supported by reliable sources. The claim is a mix of true and false information, but the specific allegation about Scott Walker is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that there haven't been tax cuts for the rich in Rhode Island is false. In 2019, Rhode Island implemented a tax cut that primarily benefited higher-income individuals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On a timetable to withdraw from Iraq"" is a reference to the U.S. military's withdrawal from Iraq, which was part of the U.S. strategy following the 2003 invasion.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from Wisconsin is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total nonfarm employment in the U.S. increased by 212,000 jobs in June 2022. Wisconsin's job growth was 10,000 jobs, which is approximately 4.7% of the total U.S. job growth. Therefore, the claim that over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from Wisconsin is an exaggeration and is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that a press conference was held and not covered by mainstream media. However, without specific details about the press conference, such as the date, location, and the organizations that were invited, it is impossible to verify the claim.

"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island's legislature is the strongest in the country is not accurate. The strength of a legislature is typically measured by factors such as the number of bills passed, the influence of the legislature on national policy, and the effectiveness of its lawmaking processes. Rhode Island's legislature is relatively small and has a lower profile compared to larger states like California or Texas, which have more significant impacts on national policy and have larger legislative bodies. Therefore, it is not accurate to describe Rhode Island's legislature as the strongest in the country.

"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by the mayor of San Francisco, London Breed, during a press conference in 2019. She stated, ""If you happen to be in this country in an undocumented status, then we welcome you here. We want you here. We'll protect you here."" This statement was part of her city's sanctuary city policy, which aims to protect undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the severity of two different actions: having an untagged alligator and hosting an open house party for kids.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that only 49 out of 3,000 faculty members at Texas A&M University brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead over the past five years is not accurate. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of a specific study or report. It is important to note that the majority of faculty members at any university are not expected to generate revenue to cover their salaries and overhead costs. Instead, they rely on institutional funding, grants, and other sources of income.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the state of Illinois spent about $320 million on illegal immigrants over the last six years is false.

There are many bills introduced in the Senate that do not have bipartisan support.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitch McConnell voted to raise Medicare costs for a current Kentucky senior by $6,000 is false. Medicare costs are determined by the federal government and are not directly influenced by individual senators' votes. Medicare benefits and costs are set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) based on federal laws and regulations, not by individual senators' votes. Therefore, it is not accurate to attribute a specific increase in Medicare costs to a single senator's vote.

Answer: 0"

According to the latest data from the University of Texas System, the four-year graduation rate for the University of Texas at Austin, the flagship campus, was approximately 65.5% in 2020. While the university has been working to improve graduation rates, the claim of a 75% graduation rate is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Texas children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching is false. Teacher training and preparation are essential components of becoming a certified educator. In Texas, as in most states, teachers must complete a teacher preparation program, pass state certification exams, and often have student teaching experience before they can teach in a classroom. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a teacher would be hired without any teaching practice.

The U.S. military used waterboarding as an interrogation technique during this period, and it was not considered torture at the time.

"Explanation: The claim that the conviction rate is almost exactly the same for whites and blacks who commit murder is not accurate. Studies have shown that there are significant racial disparities in the criminal justice system, including in murder cases.

This disparity is often attributed to a combination of factors, including implicit bias, differential treatment by law enforcement, and disparities in plea bargaining.

"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, requires members of Congress to abide by the same rules as other Americans. This includes the requirement to purchase health insurance through the federal health insurance marketplace. However, members of Congress have the option to choose a plan from the federal marketplace or a plan from their state's marketplace. They also have the option to purchase a plan from the federal marketplace that is subsidized by the government. This is similar to the subsidies available to other Americans who purchase plans through the federal marketplace.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is a mixture of true and false statements. Let's break it down:

1. **Business Income Tax**: Sen. Steve Ogden has been a vocal opponent of the business income tax, but he was not the driving force behind it. The tax was implemented as part of a broader tax reform package.

2. **Robin Hood School Finance Scheme**: This is a reference to a school finance reform bill that Sen. Ogden supported. The bill aimed to redistribute property tax revenue to schools in need, but it did not necessarily result in property taxes skyrocketing.

3. **$14 billion deficit**: The claim about a $14 billion deficit is not accurate. The state's budget deficit is not that large.

4. **Voted against gun freedoms**: Sen. Ogden has voted against certain gun control measures, but the claim that he voted against ""gun freedoms"" is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"

To verify this claim, I would need to check the latest job creation data for Ohio and compare it with other states. However, without specific data, it's challenging to confirm the claim's accuracy. Typically, job creation data is available from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics or state-specific economic reports.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be confirmed as true without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Bob McDonnel's budget does not take money out of classrooms to pave roads. The claim is a misinterpretation of budget allocations. The budget typically allocates funds to various departments, including education and infrastructure, based on the needs and priorities of the state. The claim suggests a direct transfer of funds from education to road paving, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a nation is the ""highest taxed nation in the world"" can be evaluated by looking at various sources such as the OECD's Revenue Statistics database, which provides data on tax revenues as a percentage of GDP. As of the latest available data, the highest taxed nation in the world is typically Sweden, with a tax-to-GDP ratio of around 45%. Therefore, the claim that a specific nation is the highest taxed nation in the world would need to be supported by specific data and context.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it does not specify which nation is being referred to and the highest taxed nation is typically Sweden.)"
"Explanation: The claim that Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America is false.

"Explanation: The claim about the number of undocumented immigrants living in a specific state is not verifiable without additional context.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney received exactly zero votes in at least 12 Cuyahoga County precincts is false. While it is possible for a candidate to receive no votes in certain precincts, the claim specifies a minimum of 12 precincts, which is an exact number and not a general statement. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Romney received zero votes in exactly 12 precincts without specific evidence or data to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time"" is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the majority of new jobs created in recent years have been full-time.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a plan would cut taxes without increasing the deficit is a complex economic statement that depends on the specifics of the plan.

Therefore, without specific details about the plan, it is not possible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we have the third-lowest minimum wage of developed countries is not accurate. According to the OECD, the United States has the lowest minimum wage among developed countries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While President Obama did support access to reproductive health care, including abortion, he did not explicitly state that abortion would be at the heart of his health care reform plan. His stance on abortion was more nuanced and focused on reducing unintended pregnancies and improving access to contraception, rather than making abortion a central component of his health care reform.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the library district would come at no direct cost to the city budget. This claim is true because the library district is a separate entity from the city, and its funding is typically managed through a separate taxing district.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Kendrick Meek, a former U.S. Representative from Florida, did indeed express support for Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama-Clinton administration's policies on coal have cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs is a simplification and an exaggeration. While it is true that the Clean Power Plan, a key policy of the Obama administration, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, including those that burn coal, the impact on jobs was not as straightforward as the claim suggests. The Clean Power Plan was designed to promote cleaner energy sources and reduce the environmental impact of coal, but it also aimed to create new jobs in renewable energy sectors. Additionally, the claim does not account for the broader economic factors that contribute to job losses in any industry. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about 350,000 people succeeding in crossing borders illegally each year is not accurate. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in the fiscal year 2021 was approximately 1.7 million. This figure includes both successful and unsuccessful attempts to cross the border illegally. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and not based on accurate data.

The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was a U.S. policy that prohibited military personnel from discussing their sexual orientation and required them to keep their sexual orientation secret. The policy was repealed in 2011. The claim that more than 12,500 service members were discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the policy was implemented is not accurate. The actual number of discharges under the policy was much lower. Additionally, the claim that the discharges cost over $360 million is also not accurate.

This allows voters to avoid long lines and potential wait times on Election Day.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the response to a major snow event in Atlanta to the response to a major earthquake in Kansas City, Mo. This is a false comparison because snow events and earthquakes are fundamentally different types of natural disasters. Snow events are predictable and can be prepared for, while earthquakes are sudden and unpredictable. The response to each type of event would be vastly different, with snow events requiring snow removal and road clearing, while earthquakes require immediate safety measures and structural assessments. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""he didnt call Dr. George Tiller a baby killer"" is a direct denial of the accusation made by liberal groups. The claimant is essentially admitting that he did not personally use the term ""baby killer"" to describe Dr. Tiller, but he did report that some pro-life groups branded him with that term. This does not negate the fact that the claimant was reporting the use of the term by others, which is still a form of association with the term.

"Explanation: The claim that 29 states no longer have a death tax due to the tax damaging their economic competitiveness is not accurate. The primary reason for the repeal of the death tax in many states is not economic competitiveness but rather political and ideological reasons. Many states have repealed the death tax due to pressure from conservative groups and politicians who argue that the tax is unfair and should be eliminated. The economic impact of the death tax is not the primary factor driving its repeal.

The $1.6 billion figure is a result of Walker's budget cuts, which included reductions in education funding. However, the $2 billion figure for tax breaks is an exaggeration. Walker's tax policies did include cuts and reforms, but the total amount of tax breaks provided was not $2 billion. The claim also implies a direct transfer of funds from schools to the wealthy, which is not accurate. The budget cuts and tax policies were part of a broader economic strategy that had various impacts on different sectors of the economy.

"Explanation: The claim that the federal government can cut all of the non-military discretionary spending and not balance the budget is false. Non-military discretionary spending includes programs like education, healthcare, and social services.

Additionally, the federal government's budget is influenced by many factors, including mandatory spending (like Social Security and Medicare) and revenue from taxes. Simply cutting discretionary spending does not guarantee a balanced budget.

The U.S. Constitution grants the power to declare war to Congress, not the President. While the President has the authority to use military force in response to an imminent threat or in self-defense, he does not have the authority to initiate a war without congressional approval. In the case of the 2013 Syria strike, President Obama did not have the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress.

"Explanation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010, does not require a 20 percent down payment to buy a house.

The minimum down payment required for a mortgage is typically set by the lender or the type of loan, not by the Dodd-Frank Act.

"Explanation: The claim that there are half a million fewer government employees now than when President Barack Obama took office is based on a comparison of the number of federal employees in 2009 and 2021. According to the Office of Personnel Management, the number of federal employees in January 2009 was approximately 2,094,000, while in January 2021, it was approximately 2,097,000.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal tax code has loopholes that are giving incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas is partially true. While there are certain tax provisions that can incentivize companies to move operations overseas, such as the Foreign Tax Credit, these provisions are not specifically designed to encourage job offshoring. The primary goal of these provisions is to prevent double taxation of foreign income. Additionally, the U.S. tax code includes provisions like the GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income) tax, which aims to discourage companies from shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Therefore, while there are tax incentives that can indirectly influence job offshoring, it is not accurate to say that the tax code has loopholes specifically designed to incentivize this practice.

"Explanation: The claim suggests that the overall crime decline in the United States is significantly influenced by the crime decline in New York City. While it is true that New York City has experienced a notable decrease in crime, it is not accurate to say that the national crime decline would be ""fairly small"" if it weren't for this. The United States has seen a general trend of crime decline over the past few decades, with many cities and states contributing to this trend. Therefore, the claim overstates the influence of New York City's crime decline on the national trend.

"Explanation: The claim that the Senate immigration bill would make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI, with one agent every 250 feet, is an exaggeration and not accurate.

The FBI has approximately 14,000 special agents, while the Border Patrol has around 20,000 agents. The claim of having one agent every 250 feet is a misrepresentation of the bill's provisions.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the ARRA created or saved about 2.6 million jobs in 2010. Therefore, the claim that the 2009 stimulus bill failed to get people back to work is false.

"Explanation: Ronald Reagan was a member of the Democratic Party before he switched to the Republican Party. He was a Democrat from 1932 to 1962, serving as the Governor of California from 1967 to 1975 as a Republican. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that $125 billion can be saved by not giving out money to Medicare recipients who do not exist for procedures that did not happen. This claim is false because it oversimplifies the issue and ignores the complexities of fraud detection and prevention in healthcare systems. Medicare fraud is a serious issue, but the claim's suggestion that a significant portion of Medicare spending is fraudulent is not supported by evidence. The claim also implies that all non-existent recipients and procedures are fraudulent, which is not accurate. Medicare has systems in place to detect and prevent fraud, and the claim's figure of $125 billion is not based on reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the University of Wisconsin System will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America because of a cap on tuition tied to inflation is not accurate. While the University of Wisconsin System has implemented a tuition freeze or a cap on tuition increases tied to inflation, this does not necessarily make it the most affordable campus in America. Affordability can vary greatly depending on factors such as state funding, scholarships, and financial aid available to students. Additionally, the claim that it will be ""much more affordable"" is subjective and not supported by specific data or comparisons with other institutions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On immigration reform"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide specific information or context that can be verified.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Bill Young was indeed a Republican senator, but he was not the minority leader in the Florida Senate. The minority leader is the leader of the minority party in the Senate, and there were multiple Republican senators in the Florida Senate during Young's tenure. Therefore, the claim that he was the only Republican senator is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Oregon is one of only three states that allow the use of gillnets on inland waters is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about the nature of the work, the organizations involved, or the impact made.

Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""American Hustle"" shows the FBI making real-life bribes to Washington politicians is false. ""American Hustle"" is a fictional film directed by David O. Russell, and it is not based on real-life events. The claim that the speaker is a U.S. senator and turned down bribes is also false, as the speaker is not identified and there is no evidence to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone XL is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs is not accurate. The Keystone XL pipeline project was initially proposed in 2008 and faced numerous delays due to environmental concerns and regulatory processes. However, the actual impact on job creation is complex and varies depending on the source and methodology used. While some studies suggest that the pipeline could create jobs, others argue that the overall economic impact is minimal. The claim of 100,000 jobs lost due to the delay is not supported by credible evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that iPads and iPhones are built in the United States of America is false.

"Explanation: The claim that ""I never called for a partition of Iraq"" is false. In 2006, then-U.S. President George W. Bush stated that the U.S. would support a partition of Iraq into three separate entities: a Kurdish region, a Sunni region, and a Shia region. This statement was made in a speech at the American University in Washington, D.C., and was widely reported in the media at the time.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that in the history department at the University of Texas, only one out of 50 registered voters is a Republican.

"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years is not verifiable without specific data or sources. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to refer to official employment statistics or reports from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that Oregon's high minimum wage is the reason why restaurants employed fewer workers by 2011. However, correlation does not imply causation. The decrease in the number of employees could be due to various factors such as economic downturns, changes in consumer behavior, or other industry-specific trends. Without specific data showing a direct link between the minimum wage increase and the decrease in employment, the claim is not supported.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The current President of the United States, Joe Biden, has publicly stated his support for same-sex marriage. He has also signed an executive order that reverses a previous policy that restricted the rights of transgender individuals in the military. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that he agrees with the claim that marriage should be between a man and a woman.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Climatic Research Unit (CRU) e-mails, often referred to as ""Climategate,"" were a series of hacked e-mails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. The e-mails were leaked in 2009 and sparked controversy, with some claiming they showed evidence of scientific misconduct or manipulation of data. However, multiple independent investigations, including those by the Royal Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and the U.S. House of Representatives, found no evidence of scientific misconduct or manipulation of data. The e-mails did not debunk the science behind climate change; they merely showed that scientists were engaged in normal scientific practices, such as discussing data and methods, and occasionally expressing frustration with the process of peer review and public communication. Therefore, the claim that the CRU e-mails show that the science behind climate change has been debunked is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that PPS (Public Employees Retirement System) employees have paid their own PERS contributions for many years is false. PERS contributions are typically paid by both the employer and the employee. The employee's contribution is usually a percentage of their salary, while the employer's contribution is also a percentage of the employee's salary. This is a standard practice for public employee retirement systems to ensure that both parties contribute to the retirement fund.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, about 28% of uninsured individuals lived in households where at least one person was working. The claim states that 70% of uninsured individuals live in such households, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Nevada ranks 50th in the money received from the stimulus bill is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's data, Nevada received the 10th highest amount of stimulus funds per capita among the states. The claim likely confuses Nevada's ranking in terms of total stimulus funds received with its ranking in terms of funds received per capita.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""just about half of rural hospitals operate in the red in Virginia"" is difficult to verify without specific data or sources. However, it is known that rural hospitals often face financial challenges due to lower patient volumes, higher costs, and limited access to specialized care. Therefore, it is plausible that a significant number of rural hospitals in Virginia may operate at a loss. Without concrete data, it is challenging to definitively say whether exactly half of them are in the red.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the numbers of people who support Obamacare and like it have been steadily dropping is not accurate. According to various polls and surveys, public opinion on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has been relatively stable over time. While there have been fluctuations in support, the overall trend has not shown a steady decline. For instance, a 2021 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 56% of Americans approved of the Affordable Care Act, which is similar to the levels of support seen in previous years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The region you represent, which is not specified, cannot have more automotive plants than the entire state of California. California is home to numerous automotive plants, including those of major manufacturers like Tesla, Toyota, and Honda. As of now, there are no regions that can claim to have more automotive plants than the entire state of California.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Redistricting plans are typically drawn by state legislatures and are subject to legal and political scrutiny. The claim that a specific individual, such as Nancy Nusbaum, was cut out of her state Senate district by a half a block is not a standard way to describe redistricting changes and lacks specific details that would allow for verification. Additionally, redistricting plans are usually announced and discussed publicly, and such a specific claim would likely have been reported by multiple sources if it were true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama was interviewed by American reporters in Asia, and they did ask him about Asia and the economy.

Additionally, during his 2010 trip to India, he was asked about the economy and trade relations with Asia by American reporters.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010, and Wisconsin's Senator at the time, Russ Feingold, voted against it. The claim that a majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care is not accurate, as the ACA was supported by a majority of Americans at the time of its passage. Therefore, the claim that Feingold voted for it anyway is also incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Former U.S. President Barack Obama did not choose to deny the anti-Semitic motivation of the attack on a kosher Jewish grocery in Paris. In fact, he publicly condemned the attack and acknowledged the anti-Semitic nature of it. He stated, ""The attack on the kosher grocery store in Paris was an attack on the Jewish community, and it was an attack on the values that we share."" This statement was made in a press conference following the attack.

"Explanation: The claim that gas prices have never been higher is true. As of my last update in October 2023, gas prices have reached record highs in many regions around the world. Additionally, Exxon Mobil's profits have also been high due to the increased demand for energy and the high prices of oil and gas. Therefore, the claim that Exxon Mobil's profits have never been higher is also true.

"Explanation: Margaret Sanger, the birth control pioneer, was a controversial figure due to her views on eugenics. She believed in the idea of ""positive eugenics,"" which aimed to improve the human race by encouraging reproduction among those deemed ""fit"" and discouraging reproduction among those deemed ""unfit."" However, her views were not directed at eliminating specific groups of people, but rather at promoting the idea of selective reproduction. The claim that Sanger believed people like ""me"" should be eliminated is a misinterpretation of her views and is not supported by historical evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island was one of the first states in the union to pass a voter ID bill is false. While Rhode Island has implemented voter ID laws, it was not one of the first states to do so. The first state to pass a voter ID law was Georgia in 2005. Rhode Island's voter ID law was enacted in 2011.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing job creation during the Obama administration to the Reagan recovery. The Reagan recovery refers to the economic recovery that occurred during the 1980s, following the recession of 1980-1981. The claim suggests that Obama created more private-sector jobs in the past 27 months than Reagan did during his recovery period. However, the claim does not specify the exact time frame for the 27 months or the specific period of the Reagan recovery being compared. Without clear and specific data for both periods, it is not possible to accurately compare the job creation figures. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that states with the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates is not entirely accurate. While it is true that states with higher rates of gun ownership tend to have higher rates of gun-related suicides, this does not mean that gun ownership is the sole or primary factor contributing to suicide rates. Other factors such as mental health, socioeconomic conditions, and cultural attitudes towards guns and suicide also play significant roles. Therefore, the claim oversimplifies the issue and does not account for the complex interplay of various factors.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a politician, and it is a statement about their past actions and future intentions. However, without specific evidence or context, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Earmarks are a form of pork-barrel spending, and politicians often deny using them to maintain their image. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The Open Meetings Act is a law that requires public bodies to hold open meetings and provide notice of those meetings to the public.

"Explanation: The claim that nobody has ever escaped from a federal ""supermax"" prison is false. There have been several instances of prisoners escaping from these facilities. For example, in 2019, a prisoner named David Sweat escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, which is a high-security prison. Additionally, in 2015, two prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, escaped from the ADX Florence prison in Colorado, which is a federal ""supermax"" prison. These incidents demonstrate that escapes from federal ""supermax"" prisons are not unprecedented.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The bill in question is the ""Endless Frontier Act,"" which was introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2021. The bill does not create a $50 billion slush fund. Instead, it establishes a new agency, the National Science and Technology Council, to coordinate federal research and development efforts. The bill also includes provisions for funding research and development in various fields, but it does not create a fund that can be used for virtually any purpose by the Treasury Secretary.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama and the Democrats have ""proposed a tax for not having health insurance"" is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Obama, does include a provision for a penalty for not having health insurance, but it is not a tax. The penalty is often referred to as the ""individual mandate"" and is designed to encourage people to obtain health insurance. The penalty is not a tax in the traditional sense and is not collected by the IRS in the same way as taxes are.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that animal abuse is often an indicative trait of future acts of violence against humans is supported by several studies and research findings. Animal abuse is often considered a ""red flag"" behavior, as it can indicate a pattern of violent behavior. This is because the perpetrator may not differentiate between humans and animals, and the abuse of animals can be a precursor to abuse against humans. However, it's important to note that not all individuals who abuse animals will go on to abuse humans, and the correlation is not absolute.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was a United States military policy that prohibited open discussion of sexual orientation in the military. The policy was repealed in 2011, and it is not accurate to say that all those who do not answer directly to the president have said that repealing it was a terrible idea. The claim is a generalization and does not reflect the diverse opinions of individuals who may or may not have been directly involved in the policy's repeal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There have been Democratic women in Congress from New Jersey in recent decades. For example, Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democratic representative from New Jersey's 12th congressional district, has been serving since 2015. Therefore, the claim that there has not been a Democratic woman in Congress from New Jersey in almost four decades is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration increased the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes by 70 percent is false. While it is true that the Obama administration deported a large number of immigrants, including those convicted of crimes, the increase in deportations was not 70 percent. The actual increase was around 25 percent from 2009 to 2016. This misrepresentation of the data is a common tactic used to spread misinformation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Washington has run out of money about halfway through fiscal year 2009 is false. The U.S. federal government does not ""run out of money"" in the sense that it cannot pay its bills. The federal government has the ability to borrow money to meet its obligations. In 2009, the U.S. government did face significant financial challenges due to the Great Recession, but it did not run out of money.

"Explanation: The claim that Panasonic stayed in New Jersey because of the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant (BRRAG) program is false. Panasonic's decision to stay in New Jersey was primarily driven by the company's long-term strategic plans and the state's business-friendly environment, rather than the BRRAG program. The BRRAG program is a state incentive program designed to help businesses relocate to New Jersey, but it is not the primary reason for Panasonic's decision to remain in the state.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay"" is false. Federal employees are generally not covered by collective bargaining agreements, but they do have collective bargaining rights for certain benefits and pay. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) allows federal employees to bargain collectively over certain issues, including benefits and pay, but the specifics of what can be bargained over are limited compared to private sector employees. Therefore, the claim is misleading as it suggests that no federal employees have collective bargaining rights, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about offshore oil drilling is a general statement and does not provide specific information that can be verified as true or false. Offshore oil drilling is a well-documented and widely practiced industry, but the claim itself is too broad to be evaluated as true or false without additional context.

"Explanation: The claim is true. Same-day voter registration allows individuals to register to vote and cast their ballot on the same day.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Rhode Island has consistently ranked among the states with the highest rates of substance abuse, including opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder. However, it's important to note that the ranking can change from year to year, and other states may also have high rates of substance abuse. Therefore, while Rhode Island has historically had high rates of substance abuse, it is not accurate to say that it continues to have the highest rates in the country without specifying the time period and comparing it to other states.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered the ocean closed is clearly false. Presidents do not have the authority to close the ocean, and such a statement is not a part of any official policy or action taken by the Obama administration. This claim appears to be a humorous or satirical statement, often used to describe a situation where someone has made a ridiculous or extreme claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario that assumes the immediate opening of a gas reserve in Alaska and its impact on gas prices within five years. However, the actual impact of such a decision on gas prices is influenced by numerous factors, including market demand, supply chain logistics, geopolitical events, and regulatory policies. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific studies or data to support the assertion that gas prices would reach $2 per gallon within five years. Therefore, the claim is speculative and lacks concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about John McCain's past and present positions on the payroll tax.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama added $16 trillion to the national debt is false.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has publicly stated that she supports comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. However, she has not explicitly advocated for ""open borders"" in the sense of unrestricted immigration. Her stance is more nuanced and focuses on reforming the immigration system rather than advocating for completely open borders.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution grants the President the authority to use military force in certain circumstances, such as when there is an actual or imminent threat to the nation. However, the President must typically obtain authorization from Congress for military actions that do not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat. Unilateral military attacks without such authorization are not consistent with the U.S. Constitution and legal precedent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Homosexuality is no longer a felony in any state in the U.S. The Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) struck down laws that criminalized sodomy, including those that targeted homosexuality. Since then, all states have repealed such laws. Therefore, the claim that homosexuality remains a felony in some states is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a tax plan proposed by a candidate, and it's not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim without additional context or specific details about the tax plan. The claim itself is a statement made by a candidate, and without knowing the specifics of the plan or the calculations behind it, it's impossible to determine if it would indeed leave the federal government with a $1.1 trillion hole.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government borrows money to fund its operations, but this does not mean that the money would be available for entrepreneurs and businesses if the government did not borrow. The money borrowed by the government is used to pay for government services, infrastructure, and other expenses. If the government did not borrow, it would likely have to raise taxes or cut spending to balance its budget, which could have negative effects on the economy. Additionally, the money borrowed by the government is not directly available for entrepreneurs and businesses to use for job creation and business expansion.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the person started criticizing the war in Iraq before Barack Obama did is false. Barack Obama was a vocal critic of the Iraq War before he became President. He publicly opposed the war in 2002 and 2003, well before he was elected in 2008. Therefore, the claim that someone else started criticizing the war in Iraq before Obama is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Members of Congress have access to a different health insurance plan than other federal employees. Congress members and their families are eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a comprehensive health insurance plan. However, the specific plans and benefits available to members of Congress are different from those available to other federal employees. For instance, members of Congress have access to a more extensive network of providers and may have different cost-sharing arrangements.

Answer: 0"
"Claim: Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country.

Explanation: Georgia's ballot access laws are indeed considered among the most restrictive in the country. The state requires candidates to collect a significant number of signatures to qualify for the ballot, and the signature requirements are higher than in many other states. Additionally, Georgia has strict rules regarding the timing and placement of signature collection efforts. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sidney Blumenthal wrote that the Benghazi attack was almost certainly preventable is false. Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton aide, did not write any such statement. The claim is a misinterpretation of Blumenthal's emails, which were released during the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails did not attribute the preventability of the Benghazi attack to Hillary Clinton or the State Department. The claim is a distortion of the facts and is not supported by any credible evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general trend and correlation, but it lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that distracted driving, such as texting, is the primary cause of the rise in traffic deaths on Georgia roadways this year.

"Explanation: The claim about homeowners across Ohio signing mineral rights agreements and over a billion dollars worth of leases being signed to date is not verifiable with the information provided.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution requires a supermajority of 60 senators to break a filibuster, but this is not the first time it has been required. The 60-vote threshold has been used in various instances throughout history, including during the Obama administration and the Trump administration. The claim that this is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators is inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Texas General Land Office (GLO) does not earn money from wind leases that haven't produced energy. The GLO manages the state's land and mineral rights, but it does not generate revenue from leases that do not produce energy. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the GLO's role and responsibilities.

"Explanation: The claim that ""a couple of hundred American cities are infested by members of the Mexican cartels"" is an exaggeration. While it is true that Mexican cartels have a presence in some U.S. cities, the extent of their influence and the number of cities affected are often overstated. The U.S. Department of Justice and other law enforcement agencies have reported that cartels operate in a limited number of cities, primarily along the U.S.-Mexico border and in major metropolitan areas. The term ""infested"" suggests a widespread and significant presence, which is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that 50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens is not accurate. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, in 2019, 1,650 murders were reported in Texas, and only 10 percent of these were attributed to illegal immigrants. This information is based on data from the Texas Department of Public Safety and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

"Explanation: The claim that there are very few women and children among Syrian refugees and migrants coming into Europe is not accurate. In reality, the gender distribution among Syrian refugees is roughly equal, with about 50% being women and 50% being children. The perception of fewer women and children may be due to the fact that men are often the ones making the journey first to establish a foothold in Europe, while women and children follow later. Additionally, the media often focuses on the male refugees, which can create a skewed perception.

"Explanation: The claim that a legislative debate on airport pat-down procedures initiated federal changes in security procedures is true. In 2013, there was a significant debate in the U.S. Congress about the use of pat-downs and other security procedures at airports, following the incident of a passenger who was subjected to a pat-down after being caught with a knife. This debate led to changes in the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) procedures, including the use of advanced imaging technology and the implementation of the ""Known Crew Member"" program. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"

"Explanation: The claim is false. The amount of money a person takes home after taxes depends on various factors such as the tax rate, deductions, and credits. The claim suggests a flat reduction of $125,000 from $250,000, which is not accurate. The actual take-home pay would be calculated based on the individual's tax bracket and other deductions.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the funding sources of two political campaigns, the Doherty Campaign and the Cicilline Campaign. The claim states that the Doherty Campaign is funded mostly by individual donors, while the Cicilline Campaign relies on big PACs.

However, without specific data, it is not possible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified with the given information.)"
"Explanation: The claim that the president and vice president cannot be from the same state is false. There is no constitutional or legal restriction that prevents the president and vice president from being from the same state.

For example, in 1993, both President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were from Tennessee.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a political figure, suggesting that they campaigned on the proposals in the budget repair bill for Wisconsin. This claim is subjective and depends on the specific proposals and the extent to which they were emphasized during the campaign. Without specific details about the proposals and the campaign, it is difficult to verify the claim's accuracy. However, the statement ""Anybody who says they are shocked on this has been asleep for the past two years"" suggests that the proposals were well-known and discussed during the campaign.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true based on the statement that the proposals were well-known and discussed during the campaign.)"
"Explanation: The claim is made by a former mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, and it includes specific references to various publications and years. However, the claim is not verifiable through reliable sources. USA Today, Money Magazine, and All Cities Almanac are real publications, but the specific claims made about Providence's ranking and safety are not substantiated by any credible sources.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic that is not supported by reliable sources. The Guttmacher Institute, which is a leading research and policy organization on reproductive health, reports that major complications from abortion are rare. According to their data, the rate of major complications from abortion is less than 0.1% (1 in 1,000). The claim of 2 to 3 Texas women per week having major complications and 10 women per week seeking help at an ER after an abortion is not supported by credible sources and appears to be an exaggeration.

"Explanation: Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is a tool used by local governments to fund infrastructure and development projects. When a TIF district is created, the property taxes generated within that district are used to fund the project. The general fund is not directly impacted by TIF because the taxes are specifically allocated to the project. Therefore, the claim that TIF funding will take funds from the general fund for Pinellas County or the city of St. Pete is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion every year is often cited but is not accurate. The actual economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy is more complex and varies by year.

Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that criminals have learned how to spy on Americans by hacking into home computers and looking through video cameras attached to screens is a common misconception. While it is true that hackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to computers and use webcams, the claim that this is a widespread or common practice among criminals is not supported by evidence. Most cybersecurity experts advise against using webcams for security purposes due to the risk of hacking, but this does not mean that criminals are actively spying on Americans through this method.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Texas public school funding grew three times the rate of enrollment from 2002 to 2012. To verify this, we need to look at the actual data for both funding and enrollment during this period. According to the Texas Education Agency, the total funding for public schools in Texas increased from $20.4 billion in 2002 to $47.7 billion in 2012. Meanwhile, the student enrollment increased from 3.5 million to 4.8 million during the same period. The growth rate of funding was approximately 135% (from $20.4 billion to $47.7 billion), while the growth rate of enrollment was approximately 42% (from 3.5 million to 4.8 million). Therefore, the funding did not grow three times the rate of enrollment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ohio has lost over 100,000 jobs since the stimulus package was passed is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Ohio's unemployment rate has been decreasing since the implementation of the stimulus package.

"Explanation: The claim that the GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters is false. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders. It is calculated as the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy. While GDP can fluctuate and may even decrease in certain quarters, it is highly unlikely to be zero. Economic activity, even in the most severe economic downturns, does not cease entirely, and thus GDP would not be zero.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about job gains in New Jersey (McMansion State) since Chris Christie took office. It states that while there have been some job gains, they have lagged behind the nation as a whole and the states of New York and Connecticut.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the CEA's findings.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim about the privatization of Social Security is complex and depends on the specific context and details of the claim. Social Security is a government-run program that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible individuals. Privatization typically refers to the transfer of government services or assets to private entities. In the context of Social Security, privatization could mean shifting the system to private accounts or reducing government control over the program.

However, the claim itself is vague and does not specify whether it is referring to a specific proposal, law, or policy change. Without more context or specific details, it is difficult to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or incomplete as it lacks specific details to be judged as true.)"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified information indicating that U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson supports a plan for privatizing Social Security. The claim appears to be a misrepresentation or a misunderstanding of his political stance.

"Explanation: The claim that Iran continues to pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons is a complex issue that has been subject to various interpretations and assessments. While Iran has been accused by some countries and organizations of pursuing nuclear weapons, it is important to note that Iran has consistently maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been monitoring Iran's nuclear activities, and while there have been concerns and disputes, the IAEA has not found conclusive evidence that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the claim that Iran continues to pursue nuclear weapons is not universally accepted as true by all objective observers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""we are already bombing seven countries"" is not accurate. As of my last update in October 2023, the United States has been involved in military operations in several countries, but the exact number of countries being bombed can vary and is often subject to change. It's important to note that the number of countries involved in military operations can change frequently due to political and military developments. Therefore, the claim as stated is not specific and cannot be verified as true or false without more context.

Therefore, the claim that 67 percent of marriages end in divorce is an exaggeration.

Therefore, the claim that he has not worked anywhere outside of politics is false.

The Times' initial report in 2016 stated that Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State was ""inconsistent with the practices of other government officials."" However, the FBI investigation into the matter did not find evidence that Clinton had broken any laws. The Times did not retract its story, and the claim that they did is a misrepresentation of the facts.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton's health care plan from the 1990s, known as the Health Security Act, did not have a broader provision in favor of corporate right to back out of providing contraceptive coverage than the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision. In fact, the Health Security Act proposed a mandate for employers to provide contraceptive coverage, which was later challenged by Hobby Lobby in the Supreme Court. The Hobby Lobby decision, which was decided in 2014, allowed for-profit corporations to refuse to provide contraceptive coverage based on religious beliefs, which was not a provision in Clinton's 1990s plan.

While it is true that some graduates may struggle to find employment or jobs that align with their degree, the claim that ""half"" of them face this issue is not accurate. According to various sources, the unemployment rate for recent graduates is typically around 5-10%, not 50%. Therefore, the claim is false.

Therefore, the claim that Hillary Clinton's plan is the only one that covers every American is false.

The 9/11 hijackers were all from Saudi Arabia, and their families were not involved in the attacks. The claim is a misinterpretation of the fact that some of the hijackers' families were allowed to return to Saudi Arabia after the attacks, but this was due to diplomatic and legal processes, not because they were sent back to watch their boyfriends on television.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Koch brothers did not give twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett.

"Explanation: The claim that repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would save $95 billion in 2016 is false. The $95 billion figure is a misinterpretation of a study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that estimated the cost of repealing the ACA. The CBO's report stated that repealing the ACA would reduce federal spending by $145 billion over 10 years, not $95 billion in 2016. Additionally, repealing the ACA would likely increase the number of uninsured Americans, leading to higher costs for hospitals and other healthcare providers, which would offset any savings.

"Explanation: The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) does indeed place the responsibility for cleanup and containment of oil spills primarily on the party responsible for the spill. This is often referred to as the ""polluter pays"" principle. The act requires the responsible party to take immediate action to prevent or minimize the discharge of oil and to provide for the cleanup of the oil. The Obama administration, like any other administration, would be bound by this law. Therefore, the claim is true.

"Explanation: FirstEnergys annual revenues are not greater than the GDP of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, or 15 African nations. The GDP of these countries and the revenues of FirstEnergy are not comparable in the same context.

The GDP of these countries is a measure of their total economic output, while FirstEnergy's revenues are a measure of its business performance. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that ""above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth"" is not accurate. According to various studies and reports, the number of Muslims who are radicalized or extremist is a small fraction of the global Muslim population. For instance, a 2019 Pew Research Center report estimated that about 13% of Muslims worldwide hold extremist views, which translates to around 200 million people. This is significantly less than the 800 million figure stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim that more than half of Muslims are radicalized is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplistic assumption that freezing spending at 2007 levels would automatically balance the budget and cut the national debt in half by 2020. However, this ignores several factors:
1. **Economic Growth**: The economy grows over time, and spending needs to grow with it to maintain services and infrastructure.
2. **Inflation**: Prices increase over time, so the value of money decreases. Therefore, spending needs to increase to maintain the same level of services.
3. **Demographic Changes**: Population growth and aging can increase spending on social services.
4. **Economic Downturns**: Economic crises, like the 2008 financial crisis, can lead to increased spending to stimulate the economy.

Given these factors, freezing spending at 2007 levels would not balance the budget or cut the national debt in half by 2020. The claim is therefore false.

"Explanation: The claim that more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners is an overgeneralization and an exaggeration. While intimate partner violence is a serious issue, the actual number of women who die from such violence is lower.

This number is significantly lower than the claim of more than three women per day.

"Explanation: The claim that Medicaid has grown by 1,600 percent in the last 30 years in Virginia is misleading. While Medicaid enrollment has indeed increased significantly over time, a 1,600 percent growth rate is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicaid enrollment in Virginia has grown from approximately 1.2 million enrollees in 1990 to around 1.7 million enrollees in 2020. This represents a growth rate of about 42 percent, not 1,600 percent.

The cost of a new City-run criminal background check process would depend on various factors such as the scope of the checks, the number of people involved, and the efficiency of the process.

"Explanation: The claim that the tax changes in January 2023 are ""OBAMA TAX HIKES"" is false. The tax changes in question are part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law by President Trump, not President Obama. Additionally, the claim that these tax changes will ""slam every American's savings, investments, and job opportunity"" is not supported by evidence.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax"" is based on a misinterpretation of a study by the Tax Policy Center. The study found that 47% of Americans do not pay federal income tax, but this does not mean they pay no tax at all. Many of these individuals are low-income earners who do not earn enough to owe federal income tax, but they may still pay other taxes such as payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare) or state and local taxes. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: The claim that a new financial regulation ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks"" is false. Financial regulations are typically designed to prevent future crises and protect taxpayers from bearing the costs of bank failures.

"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget is a simplification of a complex political and economic situation. Ted Strickland served as the Governor of Ohio from 2007 to 2011. During his tenure, Ohio faced significant economic challenges, including the Great Recession. The budget cuts he implemented were part of efforts to address the state's fiscal crisis.

The claim is a misinterpretation of the ACA's provisions.

"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, including Virginia, income tax rates are progressive, meaning that higher earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.

For example, in Virginia, the top income tax rate is 5.75% for income over $12,000, while the lowest rate is 0% for income up to $12,000. Therefore, a cashier earning $20,000 per year would pay a lower tax rate than a hedge fund manager earning $20 million per year.

For example, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had a background in law and politics, and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had a long career in the military and private sector. Therefore, the claim that 92 percent of his administration had never worked outside government is an exaggeration and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that 56 percent of weekend voters in Cuyahoga County in 2008 were African American, while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population. This claim is false because it suggests a disproportionately high percentage of African American voters on weekends compared to their representation in the county's adult population. This is unlikely to be accurate as voter turnout is typically influenced by various factors such as accessibility, interest in the election, and other demographic factors, not just race.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The FBI does have the power to block terror suspects from purchasing firearms, explosives, and other dangerous items. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) can investigate and prevent individuals from purchasing such items if they are deemed a threat. The claim suggests that the FBI lacks this authority, which is incorrect.

"Explanation: Jon Husted has indeed been on the ballot multiple times for different political offices since 2000. He has served as the Secretary of State of Ohio, a position he held from 2013 to 2019. Before that, he served as the Auditor of State of Ohio from 2005 to 2013. Additionally, he has run for other offices, including the U.S. Senate in 2012. Therefore, the claim that he has been on the ballot six times for three different political offices is accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as of 2021, New Jersey spends more on Medicaid than New York. New Jersey's Medicaid spending was approximately $14.5 billion, while New York's was around $13.5 billion. Therefore, the claim that only New York spends more on Medicaid than New Jersey is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the spending of two different political campaigns, Cantor's and Brat's. Without specific data or sources to verify the claim, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that the average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean is not accurate. While there are some differences in height between the two populations, the claim of a 3-inch difference is an exaggeration. Studies have shown that the average height difference is more modest, typically around 1-2 inches. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Austin was the site of the first mass shooting in the country is false. The first mass shooting in the United States occurred in 1892 in the town of New York, New York, when a man named Patrick Henry Collins shot and killed 10 people. Austin, Texas, has had several notable mass shootings, but it is not accurate to say it was the site of the first mass shooting in the country.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not fire more cruise missiles than all other Peace Prize winners combined. The claim is a misinterpretation of the data and a false comparison. The Peace Prize winners are individuals who have made significant contributions to peace, not military leaders. The claim is a political statement rather than a factual one.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""more than one-quarter of America's young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military"" is based on a study conducted by the RAND Corporation. The study found that approximately 26% of young adults aged 17-24 are too overweight to meet the military's physical fitness standards. This means they would not be able to pass the physical fitness test required for enlistment. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: To evaluate the claim, I would need to check the unemployment rate data for New Castle County over the past two years. If the unemployment rate has indeed not almost doubled, then the claim is true. If it has doubled or nearly doubled, then the claim is false.

This bill was part of a broader effort to address the state's financial challenges.

Answer: 1"

According to the U.S. Congress website, the 117th Congress (2021-2023) has passed several appropriations bills, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022. Additionally, the 116th Congress (2019-2021) passed several appropriations bills, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. Therefore, the claim that no appropriations bills have been brought to the floor this year is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about a 34 percent increase in violent crime in California within the last year is not accurate. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the violent crime rate in California has been fluctuating but has not shown a significant increase of 34 percent in the last year. The FBI's data for 2020 and 2021 shows a decrease in violent crime rates in California, not an increase.

"Explanation: The claim that Goldman Sachs was Barack Obama's ""No. 1 private contributor"" is false. While Goldman Sachs did contribute to Obama's presidential campaigns, it was not the top contributor. The top private contributor to Obama's campaigns was George Soros, who contributed $2.5 million to his 2008 campaign and $10 million to his 2012 campaign. Goldman Sachs contributed $1.2 million to Obama's 2008 campaign and $1 million to his 2012 campaign.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that liquor sales account for nearly $1 billion in the state budget for this biennium. However, without specific data or a reliable source to verify this claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy. Typically, state budgets are publicly available and can be cross-referenced for such specific figures. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on early census returns, which are not yet finalized and may not accurately reflect the overall response rates. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that conservatives have been measurably less likely to return their census forms. Without concrete evidence, it is not possible to verify the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the church Barack Obama belongs to only admits black people is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Bill Young used his campaign money for a luxury car is false. Campaign funds are typically used for campaign-related expenses such as advertising, staff salaries, travel, and other operational costs. There is no evidence to suggest that Bill Young used his campaign funds for a personal luxury car.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Georgia has indeed been known for its robust scholarship programs, including the HOPE Scholarship, which provides financial assistance to Georgia residents attending eligible postsecondary institutions. However, the claim that Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""richest."" Other states may have more comprehensive or higher-value scholarship programs. Therefore, while Georgia's scholarship programs are notable, it is not accurate to say that it has one of the richest programs without additional context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy prisons is false. Tax breaks and deductions are typically associated with personal income tax, not the purchase of prisons. Prisons are government-owned facilities, and their purchase or construction is not a private transaction that would qualify for tax incentives. Additionally, there is no evidence or official announcement from any government or authoritative source supporting this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) does not rate senators or provide such rankings. The CDF is a non-profit organization that focuses on advocating for children's rights and well-being, but it does not publish or endorse any ratings or rankings of politicians. Therefore, the claim that the CDF rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not make the first speech to the nation's school children about persisting and succeeding in school. In fact, he delivered a speech to school children on September 8, 2009, which was not the first time a president had addressed school children. Previous presidents, including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, had also spoken to school children.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did introduce significant consumer protections for insured Americans, such as the requirement for insurers to cover pre-existing conditions and provide essential health benefits. However, the claim that ""every uninsured American can become insured"" is not entirely accurate. While the ACA expanded access to health insurance, it did not guarantee that every uninsured American would become insured due to factors like income, eligibility for Medicaid, and personal choices. Some people may still remain uninsured due to these factors.

Answer: 0.5"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as President Barack Obama's ""jobs bill,"" did not include provisions that allowed individuals to sue if they were unemployed and did not get a job. The bill focused on economic stimulus and job creation, but it did not provide a legal mechanism for individuals to sue based on their unemployment status.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney wants to end tax credits for wind producers is false. Mitt Romney has not proposed or advocated for the elimination of tax credits for wind producers.

He did not propose any significant changes to tax credits for wind producers during his campaign or subsequent political career.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling will directly link a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts for the first time ever is false. While it is true that debt ceiling increases often come with conditions or offsets, such as spending cuts or revenue increases, the claim that this is the first time ever is incorrect. There have been numerous instances in the past where debt ceiling increases were accompanied by spending cuts or other offsets.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ron Paul's voting record is virtually identical to his voting record except for foreign policy is false. Ron Paul's voting record is known for its consistency in certain areas, such as his opposition to the Federal Reserve and his support for limited government. However, his voting record is not identical to his voting record, as he has voted differently on various issues, including foreign policy. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse is an exaggeration. While it is true that the 2008 financial crisis had a disproportionate impact on African-American communities, with many losing their homes and savings, the claim that they lost half of their wealth is not accurate. According to a report by the Pew Research Center, the median wealth of African-American households fell by 34% between 2005 and 2010, but this does not equate to a loss of half of their wealth.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report. The CBO estimated that a cap-and-trade program could increase the cost of living for the average family by about $1,000 per year. This is not equivalent to a postage stamp a day, which costs about $0.50. The claim exaggerates the impact of the CBO's findings.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about campaign contributions from electric utilities is generally true. Many electric utilities in the United States are regulated by state public utility commissions and are required to disclose their political contributions. These contributions are often made to support candidates who are seen as favorable to the industry's interests, such as those who support deregulation or other industry-friendly policies.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that Jon Corzine did not raise tolls by 50 percent. However, this claim is false because Jon Corzine, who served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2002 to 2006, did indeed propose a 50 percent increase in tolls during his tenure. This proposal was part of a broader plan to address the state's budget deficit.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that deep poverty has reached its highest level on record over the past three years is false. According to the World Bank, the global poverty rate has been declining over the past few decades. In 2015, the global poverty rate was 10.0%, and by 2018, it had fallen to 8.6%. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on poverty rates, the World Bank's latest data shows that the global poverty rate in 2020 was 9.1%, which is still lower than the rate in 2015. Therefore, the claim that deep poverty has reached its highest level on record is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military has not asked for is false. Romney has proposed increasing the defense budget, but the specific figure of $2 trillion is not accurate. He has suggested increasing the defense budget by around $100 billion, which is a significant increase but not the $2 trillion mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the claim that the military has not asked for this increase is misleading, as the military has requested increases in the defense budget.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Michael Williams, a U.S. House opponent, does not live in and has never voted in the congressional district he is seeking to represent. This claim is false because it is a common practice for candidates to run for office in districts where they do not currently reside. Many candidates move to the district they are running in or have lived there previously. The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that Williams has never voted in the district or does not live there.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal corporate tax rate is 21%, not 44.6%. Additionally, the Canadian federal corporate tax rate is 15%, but this is not the total business tax rate in Canada. Provincial and territorial taxes also apply, which can increase the overall tax burden. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. tax rate on successful small businesses is 44.6% and the business tax rate in Canada is 15% is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the annual spending on highways to the total spending on Amtrak over its entire 40-year history. The claim is false because it is comparing apples to oranges. The spending on highways is an annual figure, while the spending on Amtrak is a cumulative figure over 40 years. Therefore, the claim is misleading and cannot be accurately judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Deer baiting, also known as deer hunting with the use of bait, is indeed illegal in Rhode Island. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) has regulations in place that prohibit the use of bait for deer hunting. Therefore, the claim that deer baiting planned for Block Island by DEM is illegal in Rhode Island is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Liberty University students were mandated to attend Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential announcement or face a fine is false.

Cruz's announcement was open to the public without any attendance requirements or fines.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Slim Jims just recently cost 99 cents but now cost $2.69 is false. Slim Jims have consistently been priced at $2.69 for a pack of 10. There is no evidence to suggest that the price has recently changed to 99 cents.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry agreed to lift Iran's economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct is false. In 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed, which included the lifting of sanctions in exchange for Iran's compliance with the agreement. However, the claim that this was done without any proof of change in conduct is misleading, as the agreement was based on Iran's commitment to limit its nuclear program and allow for inspections.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes is an oversimplification. While Estonia does offer an online tax filing system, the time it takes to complete the process can vary depending on the complexity of your tax situation. For instance, if you have a simple tax return with no deductions or credits, it might take less than five minutes. However, if you have multiple sources of income, deductions, or credits, the process could take significantly longer. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Oregon Department of Human Services in 2010. The study found that approximately 75% of child abuse and neglect reports in Oregon were made by individuals who were required to report by law, such as teachers, healthcare providers, and law enforcement officers. This information is accurate and has been verified by multiple sources.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Oregon Health Authority, which found that the implementation of Oregon's prescription-only law for pseudoephedrine (a common ingredient in methamphetamine) led to a significant reduction in meth lab incidents and arrests. The study reported a 96% decrease in meth lab incidents and a 32% decrease in meth-related arrests. These figures are supported by data and are not disputed by any credible sources.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a fictional character, Chet, who is not a real person and does not have a political stance or influence. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the truth of this claim as it is not based on any real event or person.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While it is accurate that health care premiums have increased since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the statement that they have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years is not supported by data. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, premiums have increased at a slower rate than in previous years, but this does not mean they are the slowest increase in the last 50 years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia Attorney General, has been criticized for his stance on immigration and social welfare policies. However, there is no widely reported or verified claim that he has specifically ""attacked churches for helping the poor."" While he has been critical of certain policies and organizations, there is no evidence to support the claim that he has targeted churches for their assistance to the poor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the outcomes of two different individuals' actions, Hillary Clinton and General David Petraeus, in relation to their respective scandals. The email scandal involving Hillary Clinton involved her use of a private email server for official communications, which was criticized for potential security risks and lack of transparency. General Petraeus, on the other hand, was involved in a scandal where he shared classified information with his mistress, which led to his resignation from the CIA and a prison sentence. The claim suggests that Clinton was let off the hook while Petraeus faced severe consequences. However, this is a simplification and an oversimplification of the facts. Clinton faced significant political and legal scrutiny, including investigations by the FBI and the House Select Committee on Benghazi, but was not charged with any crime. Petraeus, while facing severe consequences, was not ""destroyed"" in the sense that he was not imprisoned for a long period or faced life-altering penalties. The claim is misleading and inaccurate in its comparison.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a filibuster has never been successfully used against a Supreme Court justice is false. The most notable example is the 1968 filibuster against the nomination of Abe Fortas to the Supreme Court. The filibuster was led by Senator Strom Thurmond and lasted for 24 hours, but ultimately failed to prevent Fortas' confirmation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that scientists are questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is causing climate change is misleading. While there is ongoing scientific research and debate about various aspects of climate change, the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has repeatedly stated that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Therefore, the claim that this idea is ""more and more being put into question"" is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate is not supported by empirical evidence. While some studies have suggested that financial stress can contribute to divorce, there is no direct correlation between the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and an increase in divorce rates. Obamacare primarily focuses on expanding access to healthcare, not on marital status or divorce rates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or statement from Madison Mayor Paul Soglins indicating that his proposal to have city contractors disclose private political donations was intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees. The proposal was likely made to increase transparency and accountability in political donations, not to target specific organizations or donors.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Providence is one of the busiest fire departments for its relative size in the country is difficult to verify without specific data or a reliable source. The busiest fire departments are often determined by factors such as population density, number of fires, and response times. Without concrete evidence or a reputable source, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that former President Barack Obama refused to put his hand on his heart or say the Pledge of Allegiance is false. There is no credible evidence or historical record to support this claim. In fact, President Obama participated in the Pledge of Allegiance and other patriotic ceremonies during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about the plan and the criteria for qualifying for income-tax relief. It also does not provide any evidence or sources to support the claim that 98 percent of all small businesses in Wisconsin will qualify. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a statement made by Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, where he criticized Hillary Clinton for her stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. The claim suggests that Clinton changed her position on the TPP after Trump's criticism, implying a shift in her stance. However, this claim is false because Hillary Clinton was consistently against the TPP throughout her 2016 campaign and did not change her position based on Trump's statements.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the status of illegal immigrants is a broad topic and can vary depending on the specific context and location. Without specific details, it's challenging to determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if the claim is about a general status or policy, it would need to be backed by reliable sources and current information to be considered true.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or needs more specific information to be evaluated as true.)"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Johnson Amendment, which was indeed pushed by Lyndon B. Johnson, does not threaten religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. The amendment, passed in 1954, prohibits 501(c)(3) organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates. However, it does not strip them of their tax-exempt status if they engage in political activities, as long as they do so in a non-partisan manner and do not endorse or oppose specific candidates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Jack Kingston had more earmarks at one time than every member of the Georgia delegation put together is a specific and quantifiable statement. To verify this claim, one would need to compare the number of earmarks received by Jack Kingston with the total number of earmarks received by all other members of the Georgia delegation during the same period. Without specific data or a reliable source to support this claim, it is not possible to definitively determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Gang of Eight"" bill, also known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did not give President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees without background checks. The bill included provisions for background checks for refugees, including Syrian refugees. The bill also established a process for reviewing and admitting refugees based on security and humanitarian considerations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the speaker stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 is false. Earmarks are specific funding requests for particular projects or programs, and they were widely used by members of Congress until they were largely phased out in 2011 due to public outcry and bipartisan efforts to reduce their use. Therefore, the claim that the speaker stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of events: lightning strikes and voter fraud. The likelihood of being struck by lightning is a function of weather patterns and geographical location, while voter fraud is a legal and political issue. According to the National Weather Service, Texas is one of the states with the highest number of lightning strikes due to its size and the frequency of thunderstorms. On the other hand, voter fraud is a rare event, and its incidence is typically very low. Therefore, the claim that you are more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find in-person voter fraud is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim about whether the federal government should set a minimum wage is a topic of ongoing debate and policy discussion. It is not a fact that can be definitively judged as true or false because it depends on one's perspective and the specific context of the discussion. The federal government has set a minimum wage in the past, and the debate revolves around whether it should continue to do so, increase it, or leave it to the states.

Answer: 0 (The claim is not a definitive fact and cannot be judged as true or false.)"
"Explanation: The claim that eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke since 2010 is false. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there have been 52 child vehicular heatstroke deaths in the United States from 1998 to 2020. However, the claim specifies eight children in Georgia, which is not accurate. The NHTSA does not provide specific state-by-state data for child vehicular heatstroke deaths.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that eight Americans died in a knife attack at a Minnesota mall is false. There have been no reports of such an incident. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misreporting of a different event or a hoax.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The term ""carpet bombing"" refers to the extensive and indiscriminate bombing of a large area, often a city or a populated region, to achieve a strategic or tactical goal. It does not specifically refer to bombing the location of troops with embedded special forces to direct air power. The term is more commonly used to describe the bombing of civilian areas rather than military targets. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Too many tattoos on visible body parts keepsome applicants out of the military"" is generally true. The U.S. military, for example, has specific regulations regarding tattoos. The Army, for instance, allows tattoos on the arms, legs, and torso, but not on the head, neck, or hands. The Navy and Marine Corps have similar restrictions. These regulations are in place to maintain a professional appearance and to ensure that tattoos do not interfere with the wear of certain uniforms or equipment. Therefore, having too many tattoos on visible body parts can indeed disqualify some applicants from joining the military.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim ""You lie!"" is a direct response to President Obama's statement that health reform would not insure illegal immigrants. This claim is not a factual statement but rather an emotional or rhetorical response. It does not provide any evidence or information to support its truthfulness. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on factual information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""The fact is it's not amnesty"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. Amnesty typically refers to the forgiveness of a crime or debt, often in exchange for a promise of good behavior. Without additional context or details about what is being forgiven or the circumstances surrounding the claim, it is impossible to definitively judge whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon"" is false. In most countries, including the United States, it is illegal for private citizens to purchase automatic weapons. Automatic weapons are heavily regulated and typically require special permits or licenses, and they are not available for purchase by the general public. The claim that ""Most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon"" is also false, as the vast majority of people cannot legally purchase automatic weapons.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is made by former Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. While it is difficult to quantify the exact level of unpopularity of any governor, Christie's tenure was marked by controversies and low approval ratings. For instance, a 2014 poll by Quinnipiac University found that 42% of New Jersey residents approved of Christie's job performance, while 51% disapproved. This indicates that Christie was indeed unpopular during his tenure. However, the claim that he was ""maybe the most unpopular governor in the country"" is subjective and cannot be definitively proven. Therefore, the claim is partially true but lacks specific evidence to support the ""most unpopular"" part.

Answer: 0.5"
"Explanation: The claim that Democrats plan to raise tax rates to 70 or 80 percent is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible evidence or official proposal from the Democratic Party or any of its prominent figures suggesting such a drastic increase in tax rates. Tax policy proposals from Democrats typically focus on progressive taxation, which aims to increase the tax burden on higher-income individuals, but not to the extent of 70 or 80 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, also known as Act 10, did not seek 12 percent to 13 percent of public employees' incomes for health insurance premiums. The bill primarily focused on reducing collective bargaining rights and increasing employee contributions to health insurance and pension plans. The specific percentage increase in employee contributions was not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's energy agenda will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion is a misrepresentation of her actual policies and their potential impacts. Hillary Clinton's energy agenda, as outlined during her 2016 presidential campaign, focused on transitioning to renewable energy sources, investing in clean energy technologies, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While these policies could have significant costs, the claim of a $5 trillion cost is not supported by credible sources or analyses. The $5 trillion figure appears to be a fabrication or an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has added 200,000 new federal jobs over the last two years since President Obama took office is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of federal employees has actually decreased since 2009.

"Explanation: The claim that K-12 students in the United States are scoring at the bottom in science and mathematics in the industrialized world is not accurate. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is a global assessment of 15-year-olds' educational performance, the United States ranks 36th in mathematics and 24th in science among the 70 participating countries. While these rankings are not at the top, they are not at the bottom either. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

"Explanation: The claim that royalties for oil and other energy sources are the ""second-largest revenue source to the federal government after the IRS"" is not accurate. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is indeed the largest revenue source for the federal government, primarily through income taxes.

Without specific details or a clear source, it's challenging to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the recent drop in the unemployment rate is questionable because it was calculated over two days of the Thanksgiving week. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) typically adjusts its unemployment rate calculations to account for holidays and other factors that might affect the data. The BLS uses a method called the ""seasonal adjustment"" to account for these variations, ensuring that the unemployment rate reflects a consistent period of time. Therefore, the claim that the drop in unemployment rate is questionable due to the calculation period is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's re-election would result in state and federal income tax rates rising to roughly 65 percent for some taxpayers is false. During President Obama's second term, the top federal income tax rate was 39.6 percent for individuals earning over $400,000. Additionally, state income tax rates varied widely and did not reach 65 percent for any taxpayer. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of tax policy changes that occurred during his presidency.

Therefore, the claim that Romney has changed his position on supporting the TARP program is true.

"Explanation: The claim that ""Congress as a whole is less popular than it has been since polling was invented"" is difficult to verify without specific data and context. Popularity of Congress can vary greatly depending on the time period, specific events, and the political climate. However, general trends in public opinion polls can provide some insight. According to various polls and surveys, Congress has consistently been one of the least popular institutions in the United States for many years. While it's challenging to pinpoint an exact point in history where Congress was more popular, it's generally accepted that public opinion of Congress has been low for a significant period.

Abortion rates are influenced by various factors, including socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and cultural attitudes.

Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to support the 25 percent reduction figure.

"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has publicly stated her views on gun control, including her support for background checks and restrictions on certain types of firearms. However, she has not explicitly stated that she does not believe in the right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.

The closure of the MVC was part of a broader effort to reduce state spending and improve efficiency.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The $290 million structural surplus in the 2011-13 Wisconsin budget was not solely based on the assumption that Congress would reinstate the estate tax.

The estate tax assumption was one of several factors considered in the budget projections, but it was not the sole basis for the surplus.

Answer: 0"

Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1935, the poverty rate for the elderly was around 50%. However, by 2020, the poverty rate for the elderly was around 9.7%, not 9.4%. The claim incorrectly states the current poverty rate as 9.4%.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased since the passage of ObamaCare (the Affordable Care Act) and the stimulus package is false.

Both policies had positive impacts on the economy and employment rates.

These actions were part of her efforts to stabilize the financial system and prevent a recurrence of the crisis.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Constitution, members of Congress are paid by the federal government. During a government shutdown, which occurs when Congress and the President cannot agree on a budget, federal employees, including members of Congress, are typically not paid. However, there is a provision in the Constitution that ensures members of Congress are paid for their services, even during a shutdown. This is because the Constitution states that members of Congress are to be paid for their services, and this payment is considered a ""necessary expense"" that cannot be withheld.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Obama has flip-flopped on public campaign financing is false. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama initially accepted public campaign financing, but later decided to forgo it in order to raise funds through private donations.

"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration ""gutted"" the Project ChildSafe budget to provide trigger locks and safety kits is misleading. The Project ChildSafe program was established in 1999, during the Clinton administration, and was not directly related to the Obama administration.

"Explanation: Ebola is primarily transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of an infected person, or indirect contact with surfaces or objects contaminated with these fluids. While it is possible for Ebola to be transmitted through the air in a laboratory setting, such as through an aerosolized virus, this is not a typical or common mode of transmission in the real world. The claim that Ebola can be transmitted through a sneeze or cough is not supported by scientific evidence and is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the virus's transmission methods.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Supreme Court of the United States has not made 15 rulings stating that marriage is a fundamental right. The most relevant case is Loving v. Virginia (1967), where the Court ruled that laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional. However, the Court has not explicitly stated that marriage must be between a man and a woman. The claim also misrepresents the history and interpretation of the Court's rulings.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The highest value of a General Motors share ever was not $43, $44, or $46. The highest value of a General Motors share was $143.50, which occurred on October 1, 2007. Therefore, the claim that GM would have to sell its shares at $143 a share to pay back everything it owes is incorrect.

"Explanation: In Texas, public schools are required to teach science in a way that is consistent with the scientific method and the standards set by the Texas State Board of Education. While the Texas Education Code does not explicitly prohibit the teaching of creationism, it does not require it either. The focus is on teaching evolution as a scientific theory. Therefore, the claim that Texas teaches both creationism and evolution in public schools is misleading because while evolution is taught, creationism is not.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a telecom bill could prevent the State Corporation Commission (SCC) from obtaining rate-of-return information from electric utilities. This claim is false because the SCC's authority to regulate and oversee electric utilities is not dependent on a telecom bill. The SCC's role in regulating utilities is established by law and is not affected by telecommunications legislation. Therefore, a telecom bill would not impact the SCC's ability to gather rate-of-return information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a majority of Americans since Harry Truman days support single-payer health insurance, or full Medicare for all, is not accurate. While there has been consistent support for some form of universal healthcare among Americans, the specific support for single-payer or full Medicare for all has varied over time. Polls and surveys have shown that support for these ideas has fluctuated, and there is no consistent majority support dating back to the Harry Truman era. Additionally, the specific terminology and details of these proposals can influence public opinion, making it difficult to pinpoint a consistent majority support.

"Explanation: The claim that the Benghazi probe is the longest-running congressional investigation ever is false. While the Benghazi investigation was extensive and lasted for several years, it is not the longest-running congressional investigation in history.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that repealing the prevailing wage law would make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers. However, prevailing wage laws are typically designed to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage, and repealing such laws would not inherently create a loophole for hiring illegal workers. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the effects of repealing prevailing wage laws. Additionally, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that there is an ""illegal worker loophole"" in the state budget.

"Explanation: The United States Constitution does not explicitly state that people can be put to death. However, it does allow for the death penalty through the Fifth Amendment, which states that ""No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.""

"Explanation: The claim is false. The stimulus money funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was intended to create jobs and stimulate the economy. The claim that a government board made recommendations that would cost 378,000 jobs and $28.3 billion in sales is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. The stimulus package was designed to create jobs and boost the economy, not to eliminate them.

"Explanation: While it is true that some smaller cities and counties in Georgia may not have official websites or email addresses for their elected officials, it is not accurate to say that this is a widespread or universal issue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math is false. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a global assessment that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science. The United States typically ranks in the middle of the pack among developed countries, not developing countries. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the PISA results.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work"" is not supported by reliable sources or empirical evidence. Smart guns, which are firearms with built-in safety features, are designed to prevent unauthorized use.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the Rhode Island Parole Board never received an objection from the attorney general to the parole of convicted murderer Alfred Brissette.

Therefore, the claim that Putnam was silent is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true. Texas does not have a state income tax, but Oklahoma has been reducing its income tax rates.

"Explanation: The claim that 75 percent of United States airstrikes against ISIS return to base without having fired a weapon is not accurate. While it is true that some airstrikes do not result in weapons being fired, the percentage of such missions is not 75%. The actual percentage varies and is not consistently 75%. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the data.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, African-Americans made up about 37% of Mississippi's population in 2008, but they only accounted for about 25% of the votes in that state. Therefore, the claim that Mississippi would suddenly become a Democratic state if African-Americans voted their percentage of the population is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ann Kuster said the debate over America's debt limit is not an important issue of the day is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Harry Reid's plan is ""basically giving the president a blank check"" is a political statement that is subjective and depends on one's interpretation of Reid's plan. Reid's plan, often referred to as the ""Reid Plan,"" was a proposal to raise the debt ceiling without any specific spending cuts or revenue increases. This plan was criticized by some as giving the president a ""blank check"" because it would allow the president to increase the debt without any immediate fiscal responsibility. However, this interpretation is a matter of political opinion and not a verifiable fact.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about a specific event involving the payment of a ransom to Iran for hostages, which is a sensitive and high-profile topic. However, the claim is made in a way that suggests the speaker has personal knowledge of a videotape of this event, which is not a widely reported or verified source of information. Without credible evidence or sources to support this claim, it is not possible to verify its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Sixty-one percent of our bridges are in trouble"" is not specific enough to be verified as true or false without additional context.

Without a clear definition of what ""in trouble"" means and specific data sources, it is impossible to accurately assess the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Jeff Merkley was indeed a key figure in the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2010, but he was not the deciding vote. The deciding vote was cast by Senator Joe Lieberman, who switched his vote from opposing to supporting the bill after negotiations. Merkley's role was significant, but he did not cast the deciding vote. Additionally, the claim that Obamacare has been an unmitigated disaster in Oregon is a matter of opinion and depends on the specific metrics and perspectives used to evaluate its impact.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that a 5% increase in domestic production would have a minimal impact on the world supply and prices. However, this claim oversimplifies the complex dynamics of global energy markets. A 5% increase in domestic production could have a more significant impact on the world supply and prices depending on various factors such as global demand, supply from other countries, and market reactions. Additionally, the claim does not account for potential changes in domestic consumption patterns or the potential for increased domestic production to influence international prices.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that every time the price of gasoline rises by 1 cent, it takes a billion dollars out of the economy and sends it to Saudi Arabia is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. The impact of a 1-cent increase in gasoline prices on the economy and on Saudi Arabia's revenue is not as direct or significant as the claim suggests. The claim also implies a direct correlation between the price of gasoline and Saudi Arabia's revenue, which is not accurate. The actual economic impact of gasoline price changes is more complex and involves various factors, including consumer spending, business operations, and global energy markets.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Nancy Pelosi and others staying at a five-star hotel during the Copenhagen summit and the cost of the trip is false. The Copenhagen summit, also known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference, was held in 2009. Nancy Pelosi, a prominent figure in U.S. politics, did attend the summit, but there is no credible evidence to support the claim that she or other attendees stayed at a five-star hotel costing nearly $10,000 per person. The cost of accommodation for such events is typically covered by the host country or the United Nations, and the details of individual expenses are not publicly disclosed.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States has a record number of abortions year after year is not accurate. According to the Guttmacher Institute, the number of abortions in the United States has been declining since the 1980s. In 2019, the number of abortions was at its lowest since 1973, the year Roe v. Wade was decided. The claim may be based on a misunderstanding of the data or a misinterpretation of recent trends.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: While drone technology has advanced significantly, the claim that drones as small as birds can record individuals in their homes and immediately upload the footage to the internet is not accurate. Drones of that size would have limited battery life and storage capacity, making real-time uploading impractical. Additionally, the legal and ethical implications of such surveillance would be significant, and it's unlikely that such technology would be widely available or used without proper authorization.

"Explanation: The first word spoken from the moon was not ""Houston"". The first words spoken from the moon were ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,"" spoken by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969. The phrase ""Houston, we have a problem"" was famously spoken by Jack Swigert during the Apollo 13 mission, but it was not the first words spoken from the moon.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading cause of death among African-American men aged 15-34 is homicide, not gun-related deaths specifically. While gun violence is a significant issue, it is not the leading cause of death when considering all causes of homicide. The claim exaggerates the impact of gun violence and misrepresents the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Laureate Education, but there is no connection between Hillary Clinton's role and any alleged money laundering. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

However, the claim itself is not inherently false; it is a statement that could be true or false depending on the data sources used.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim about Bill White bringing in 250,000 refugees to Dallas and San Antonio after Hurricane Katrina and housing them in empty apartment buildings for over two years is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing the budget request for veterans in 2016 (during President Obama's term) with the appropriated amount in 1980. However, the claim does not specify whether the 1980 figure is in constant dollars or not. If the 1980 figure is not adjusted for inflation, then the claim is false because the value of money has decreased significantly over time. If the 1980 figure is in constant dollars, then the claim would need to be verified with actual data to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it does not specify whether the 1980 figure is in constant dollars or not.)"
"Explanation: The claim that seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality is not supported by any specific data or survey results.

"Explanation: The claim states that ""The state ethics commission took absolutely the same percent of cuts as most other state agencies. They were somewhere in the 7 percent range same as the governors office.""

Without specific data or official sources, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal, known as the ""Better Way"" plan, does include cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and defense spending over the long term. While it is true that the proposal does not cut these programs in the next two to three years, it does propose significant changes to these programs over a longer period. Additionally, the proposal does not cut the debt in three years; instead, it aims to reduce the debt over a longer period. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

"Explanation: Hillary Clinton's immigration platform during her 2016 presidential campaign did not propose ""totally open borders."" Instead, her platform focused on comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, increased border security, and a focus on legal immigration.

"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Barack Obama had one of the worst attendance records in the Senate is false. According to the Washington Post, Sen.

The lack of any supporting evidence or official records makes this claim unfounded.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the national healthcare law (Affordable Care Act) puts federal bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor is a common misconception. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) primarily aims to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs, not to create a new layer of bureaucracy between patients and their doctors. The law does introduce some new regulations and oversight, but these are primarily aimed at ensuring that insurance companies and healthcare providers operate in the best interests of patients. The law does not replace the patient-doctor relationship with federal bureaucrats.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Iran nuclear deal involved the U.S. giving Iran $150 billion and receiving nothing in return is a simplification and an exaggeration. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a multilateral agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States), and the European Union. The agreement involved Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The $150 billion figure refers to the estimated value of Iran's frozen assets abroad, which were released to Iran as part of the agreement. However, the claim that the U.S. received nothing in return is false, as the agreement was designed to address Iran's nuclear program and the lifting of sanctions was a key part of that agreement.

"Explanation: The claim that young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who did not serve is generally true. According to various studies and reports, such as those from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans, particularly younger ones, often face higher unemployment rates compared to their civilian counterparts. This is often attributed to factors like the transition from military to civilian life, lack of civilian work experience, and the challenges of reintegrating into the workforce.

"Explanation: The claim that Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country is likely false. While Georgia does experience a significant number of lightning strikes due to its geographical location and climate, it is not necessarily the state with the highest number of insurance claims for lightning strikes.

Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax, is not accurate. While it is true that Ohio has seen a decline in the number of family farms, the rate of loss is not as high as claimed. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of farms in Ohio has been declining, but the rate of loss is not as severe as the claim suggests. Additionally, inheritance tax is not a significant factor in the loss of family farms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. President does not have the authority to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.

The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a famous quote by Benjamin Franklin, which is often attributed to him. The original quote is: ""Nothing is certain but death and taxes."" The claim adds a humorous twist by suggesting that even Franklin did not foresee the tax man visiting on the day of one's death. This is a creative interpretation of the quote and does not change the original meaning or the fact that Franklin did indeed say something similar. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the federal government reneging on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin caused about $240 million in extra costs in the 2013-15 state budget is false. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported that the state received $1.2 billion in federal Medicaid funds in 2013 and $1.3 billion in 2014, with no significant reduction in federal funding during the 2013-15 period. The $240 million figure appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a federal program that provides health coverage to children from low-income families. The income limit for CHIP varies by state, but it is typically for families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level. In 2021, this means a family of four could earn up to $51,000 per year and still qualify for CHIP. Therefore, a family making $60,000 a year would not qualify for CHIP.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that the current minimum wage in New Jersey is insufficient to lift a single-parent family out of poverty. However, the poverty threshold for a family of three (which is the typical composition of a single-parent family with one child) in New Jersey is $26,500 per year. The current minimum wage in New Jersey is $15 per hour, which translates to approximately $31,200 per year for a full-time worker. Therefore, a single-parent family earning the minimum wage at a full-time job would not live in poverty.

Answer: 0"

The speech in question was delivered by President Barack Obama in 2009, and it was a speech aimed at improving relations with the Muslim world.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that 600,000 jobs have been lost over the last 10 years, and only Michigan and California have done worse. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the following:
1. The total number of jobs lost in the U.S. over the last 10 years.
2. The job loss in Michigan and California specifically.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. has experienced a net increase in employment over the last 10 years. As of 2021, the U.S. has added approximately 11.4 million jobs since 2011. This contradicts the claim that 600,000 jobs have been lost.

Regarding Michigan and California, both states have experienced job growth over the last 10 years. As of 2021, Michigan has added approximately 300,000 jobs, and California has added approximately 2.5 million jobs.

"Explanation: The claim that the healthcare bill will subsidize families of four that make more than $80,000 a year is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, provides subsidies for individuals and families with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL). For a family of four, this means an income of up to $104,800 in 2021. Subsidies are not provided for families with incomes above this threshold.

Budget gaps are typically calculated based on various economic indicators, revenue projections, and spending plans.

"Explanation: The claim states that 37% of Central Falls retired police officers and firefighters are out on disability pensions, while in most municipalities, about 5% of retirees collect disability pensions. This claim is comparing a specific percentage for Central Falls to a general percentage for most municipalities. Without specific data or sources to support the 37% figure for Central Falls, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim. However, the general statement about the 5% figure for most municipalities is a common statistic and is often used in discussions about disability pensions among retirees.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false because the 37% figure for Central Falls is not supported by specific data or sources.)"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific percentage of early voters in the 2008 election.

"Explanation: The claim that ""ObamaCare charges the IRS with implementing"" is false. The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) does not directly charge the IRS with implementing the law. Instead, the IRS is responsible for administering and enforcing certain provisions of the law, such as the individual mandate and the employer mandate, but it is not tasked with implementing the entire law. The implementation of the law is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that there are over 300 million firearms in the United States is an exaggeration. According to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center, about 30% of American adults own a firearm. Assuming an adult population of around 250 million, this would mean approximately 75 million adults own firearms. However, this number does not account for the fact that some people own multiple firearms, and it does not include children or other individuals who may own firearms. Therefore, the claim that there are over 300 million firearms in the country is an overestimation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government has allocated a total of $1.9 trillion for the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which includes the stimulus plan. As of the latest reports, the majority of the funds have been spent or allocated. The remaining funds are not necessarily unspent but are being held for future use or are in the process of being allocated. The claim that there is still about $400 billion or $500 billion unspent is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Harry Reid, as Senate Majority Leader, was a strong advocate for the nuclear option, and Mitch McConnell, as Senate Majority Leader, was also a proponent of it. President Obama supported the nuclear option to confirm his nominees. The claim that they changed their positions is inaccurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that a 9-9-9 tax reform plan is not regressive is based on the specifics of the plan. A regressive tax system is one where the tax burden is higher for lower-income individuals relative to their income. The 9-9-9 tax reform plan, proposed by some politicians, suggests a flat tax rate of 9% for income, 9% for sales, and 9% for capital gains. While this plan simplifies the tax code, it is generally considered regressive because it does not account for the ability to pay and can disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who spend a larger portion of their income on consumption.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a maximum age limit of 112 years for active Social Security numbers. However, the SSA does not issue Social Security numbers to individuals who are 112 years old or older. The SSA only issues Social Security numbers to individuals who are alive and have not yet reached the maximum age limit. Therefore, it is not possible for there to be 6.5 million people with active Social Security numbers who are 112 years old or older.

"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did use the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" in his speeches and statements. For example, in a 2015 speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, he said, ""We are the first nation to make the words 'liberty' and 'justice' more than just words."" He also used the phrase in a 2016 speech at the Pentagon. The claim that nobody in the administration would say these words is also false, as various officials, including the President himself, used the phrase.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The amendment in question, known as the ""Use of Force"" amendment, does indeed change existing rules of engagement for American service members. It specifies that military members may use deadly force in certain situations, such as when they reasonably believe that doing so is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or others. This is a significant change from the previous rules, which were more restrictive. Therefore, the claim that the amendment does nothing to change existing rules of engagement is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that we can fix our roads without raising taxes is generally false. Road maintenance and repair require significant funding, which often comes from taxes. While there may be some potential for cost savings through efficiency improvements, innovative funding mechanisms, or public-private partnerships, the primary source of funding for road infrastructure is typically tax revenue. Therefore, the claim that we can fix our roads without raising taxes is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim that Obama couldn't have afforded his home without Rezko's help is false. Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama purchased their home in Chicago in 2005, before he became a U.S. Senator. The home was purchased for $1.65 million, and they paid for it with their own funds. The claim that Rezko, a businessman and political donor, helped Obama afford the home is a misinterpretation of the facts. Rezko was involved in a political scandal in Illinois, but there is no evidence to suggest that he provided financial assistance to the Obamas for their home purchase.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that former President Barack Obama did not condemn left-wing attacks on General David Petraeus, despite casting other ""important votes"" earlier and later in the day.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that the Clintons charge the Secret Service $10,000 monthly rent for the use of a Secret Service residence is false. The Secret Service does not charge the Clintons for the use of their residence.

The claim about the rent being equal to their mortgage payment is also false, as the Clintons do not pay a mortgage for the Secret Service residence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), also known as the ""death panel"" by critics, was created under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to recommend changes to Medicare payments to reduce the program's costs. However, the IPAB does not have the authority to interfere with the treatment decisions between patients and their doctors. The IPAB's role is limited to making recommendations to Congress about Medicare payments, not to dictate medical treatment. The term ""death panel"" was a misnomer used by critics to suggest that the IPAB would make decisions about end-of-life care, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that David Cicilline is the 5th most liberal person in the House of Representatives is not verifiable with the information provided.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world is false. As of 2021, the U.S. has a federal corporate tax rate of 21%, which is lower than many other countries. For example, the corporate tax rate in France is 25%, in Germany it is 25%, and in Japan it is 30.62%. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world at 35% is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that the United States doubled its commitment to fighting global AIDS in the first 17 months of the current president's term. The original commitment was $500 million per year. To double this commitment, the new commitment would need to be $1 billion per year. However, the claim does not specify the new commitment amount or provide any evidence to support the doubling of the commitment. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is referring to the ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows individuals to use deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm. The claim suggests that this law has led to ""horrific events"" and that lives have been put into these situations. While it is true that the law has been criticized for contributing to an increase in gun violence and controversial shootings, the claim itself is vague and does not provide specific examples or evidence to support the assertion that the law has directly caused ""horrific events"" or put lives into these situations. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and lacks specific evidence to support its truthfulness.

"Explanation: The claim about the unemployment rate among blacks in Texas being 9.5% and wages falling for black workers since 2000 is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for blacks in Texas in 2021 was around 8.5%, which is indeed higher than the rate for whites (around 4.5%). However, the claim that the unemployment rate is ""far more than double white unemployment"" is misleading because it suggests a much higher disparity than the actual figures. Additionally, the claim about wages falling for black workers since 2000 is not supported by data. In fact, wages for black workers have generally increased over time, although the rate of increase has been slower compared to other groups.

This is part of the state's constitutional amendment process, which aims to give citizens more control over tax increases.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Fourteen million Americans mortgages are greater than the value of their homes"" is false. This statement is misleading because it implies that a significant number of Americans are underwater on their mortgages, which is not accurate. According to various sources, the number of Americans with mortgages greater than the value of their homes is much lower. For instance, as of 2021, the number of underwater mortgages in the U.S. was around 1.5 million, which is significantly less than the 14 million stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of March 2023, the total number of jobs created in the United States since the start of the Biden administration is approximately 12.5 million. This number is significantly higher than the 850,000 jobs claimed. Therefore, the claim that more than 850,000 jobs have been created, more than all the other states combined, is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 20 million illegals voting would lead to the repeal of the Second Amendment is a false and misleading statement. The Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms, is a part of the U.S. Constitution and cannot be repealed by a simple majority vote. Additionally, the claim that 20 million illegals would vote is not supported by any credible evidence or data. The actual number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is estimated to be around 10.5 million, and even if they were all to vote, it would not be enough to repeal the Second Amendment.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood has illegally sold baby parts is a misrepresentation of a 2015 controversy. The claim originated from a series of videos released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress, which alleged that Planned Parenthood was selling fetal tissue for profit. However, multiple investigations, including those by the FBI and the Department of Justice, found no evidence of illegal activity. The videos were later found to have been heavily edited and misleading. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: While toothaches can be extremely painful and uncomfortable, they are not typically life-threatening. Toothaches are usually caused by dental issues such as cavities, infections, or impacted wisdom teeth. While severe infections can lead to complications like sepsis, which can be life-threatening, this is not a common outcome of a typical toothache. Therefore, the claim that ""anyone can die of a toothache"" is an exaggeration and is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim is true. In the United States, federal law requires that military personnel be paid on time, regardless of government shutdowns. However, during a shutdown, the military is funded by the previous year's appropriations, and personnel are paid retroactively once the shutdown ends and appropriations are available. This means that while military personnel continue to serve and accrue pay, they will not actually receive their pay until the shutdown is over and the government has appropriated funds.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of Americans working in 2016 (when Obama was president) was 155.0 million, and in 2020, it was 153.7 million.

Hedge fund managers and private equity professionals often have access to various tax strategies and structures that can result in lower effective tax rates compared to those of truck drivers, teachers, and nurses. These strategies can include the use of pass-through entities, complex tax planning, and the ability to defer or reduce taxes through various deductions and credits.

"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there have been several Latinos who have served on the Austin City Council.

"Explanation: The claim is false. There are many people and organizations in various fields who are against amnesty for illegal immigrants. For example, the Center for Immigration Studies, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, and many conservative politicians and advocacy groups have publicly opposed amnesty. Additionally, there are numerous legal scholars and immigration experts who have argued against amnesty. Therefore, the claim that the speaker is the only person in this field who is against amnesty is not accurate.

While Texas has a high concentration of wealthy individuals, particularly in the oil and gas industry, the majority of Texans do not fall into the millionaire category. The claim that ""most Texans aren't millionaires"" is supported by statistical data.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The weight of a single $1 bill is approximately 1 gram. The national debt of $14.1 trillion would require 14,100,000,000,000 bills. The weight of these bills would be 14,100,000,000,000 grams, or 14,100,000,000 kilograms. An aircraft carrier typically weighs around 100,000 tons (90,718,474 kilograms). Therefore, the weight of the bills would be approximately 155 aircraft carriers, not 136.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country under Scott Walker is not accurate. According to a 2018 report by the Wisconsin Policy Forum, Wisconsin's middle class has been shrinking, but it is not the fastest rate among all states. The report also noted that Wisconsin's middle class has been shrinking at a similar rate to other states in the Midwest. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the per-student spending in Virginia in 2008 with the current spending. According to the Virginia Department of Education, the state's per-student spending in 2008 was approximately $10,000. In recent years, the per-student spending has been around $12,000 to $13,000. Therefore, the claim that Virginia spends less per student today than in 2008 is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the economic impact of Atlanta's 2000 Super Bowl was $292 million is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of people who hunt and fish in Texas with the total attendance of the Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets games. According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold in Texas annually is around 1.5 million. On the other hand, the combined attendance of the four sports teams (Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets) is significantly lower. For example, in the 2021-2022 season, the combined attendance of these teams was approximately 3.5 million. Therefore, the claim that more people hunt and fish in Texas in a given year than attend the games of the four teams combined is false.

The revenue generated from these cameras typically goes to the city or state, which uses it for various purposes such as improving infrastructure, maintaining public services, or reducing traffic congestion. Private corporations may be involved in the installation, maintenance, or operation of these cameras, but the revenue itself is usually managed by the public entity.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The religious liberty bill proposed in the Georgia House of Representatives, known as HB 105, does not explicitly exclude corporations from claiming a religious exemption. However, the bill does not provide a blanket exemption for corporations either. It allows individuals and businesses to claim a religious exemption based on their sincerely held beliefs, but it does not specify that corporations can automatically claim this exemption. Therefore, while corporations could potentially claim a religious exemption, it is not explicitly stated in the bill that they can do so.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the latest data from the New Jersey Department of Corrections, as of 2021, the prison population in New Jersey is approximately 40% African-American, not 61%. The state's overall African-American population is indeed around 13%, but the prison population is disproportionately higher due to various factors such as higher rates of arrest and conviction among African-Americans.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is not supported by reliable statistical evidence. While it is true that some students may experience a decrease in their SAT scores when retaking the test, the claim that one third of test-takers will get a lower score is an overgeneralization and not based on established data. The College Board, which administers the SAT, does not provide specific statistics on the percentage of students who score lower on a retake. Therefore, the claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Obama has declared and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions is false. While Sen. Barack Obama did express a willingness to engage in diplomatic talks with Iran during his presidency, he did not do so without preconditions. In fact, he maintained that such talks would require Iran to meet certain conditions, such as addressing its nuclear program and regional behavior. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim ""I'm proud to have had a 100 percent pro-life voting record"" is a statement that can be true or false depending on the context and the specific political positions of the individual making the claim. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting record of the individual in question. Without specific information about the individual's voting history, it is impossible to definitively determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in their monthly report on U.S. crude oil production and imports. The EIA reported that in March 2021, the U.S. produced more oil than it imported for the first time since 2002. This is a significant milestone, as it indicates a shift in the U.S.'s dependence on oil imports and a rise in domestic production.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that every eligible Mexican citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram is false.

"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that reducing obesity rates to the levels of the 1980s would significantly decrease healthcare costs, specifically for Medicare. However, this claim oversimplifies the issue. Obesity rates have been increasing due to a combination of factors, including changes in diet, physical activity, and environmental factors. Simply reducing obesity rates to 1980s levels would not necessarily lead to a trillion-dollar savings in Medicare costs. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential costs of implementing and maintaining such a reduction in obesity rates, nor does it consider the potential economic benefits of a healthier population.

"Explanation: The claim states that a 12-year council member has never chaired, vice-chaired, or led a single council committee meeting. This claim is false because it is not possible for a council member to have been in office for 12 years without having chaired, vice-chaired, or led at least one committee meeting. Council members typically have roles and responsibilities that include participating in and leading committee meetings.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Mexico can afford to build a wall because of its trade deficit with the United States is misleading. While it is true that Mexico has a trade deficit with the United States, this does not directly translate to Mexico having the financial resources to build a wall. The trade deficit refers to the difference between the value of imports and exports, which is influenced by various factors including trade policies, economic conditions, and consumer preferences. The cost of building a wall would be a significant investment that would need to be funded through government spending, which is not directly related to the trade deficit.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Chicago White Sox can still get into the playoffs mathematically depends on several factors, including their remaining schedule, the performance of other teams, and the current standings. As of my last update, I don't have real-time data, but typically, teams can still mathematically make the playoffs if they have a reasonable number of games left and are within a certain number of games behind the teams in the playoff spots. However, without specific data on the current standings and remaining games, it's challenging to definitively say whether they can still make the playoffs.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that a candidate has released their past tax returns is a common political statement. However, without specific details or evidence, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of this claim. Typically, candidates release their tax returns to build trust with voters and demonstrate transparency. If the candidate has indeed released their tax returns, this claim would be true. If not, it would be false.

Answer: 1 (assuming the candidate has released their tax returns)"
"Explanation: The claim that the media widely overlooked comments made by former President Bill Clinton about Hillary Clinton's concussion is false. The incident in question occurred in 2016 when Hillary Clinton collapsed at a 9/11 memorial service. The media extensively covered the incident, and Bill Clinton himself made comments about it. He stated that Hillary Clinton had a concussion and that it took her six months to recover. This information was widely reported in the media at the time. Therefore, the claim that the media overlooked this information is incorrect.

However, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the figures mentioned (two bucks a pop for the votes they got and 42 bucks for incumbent Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele). Without concrete evidence or data to back up these figures, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, Missouri does not have a perfect AAA credit rating. The state's credit rating is typically lower, reflecting its fiscal health and debt levels. Texas, on the other hand, has a higher credit rating, but it is not perfect AAA either. Therefore, the claim that Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act was a proposal by President Obama to invest in infrastructure and job creation. The claim that it would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year is not accurate. The act was designed to create jobs and improve infrastructure, but the cost per family was not $1,000 a year. The claim also suggests that the act would have made no significant impact, which is a subjective statement and not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about the number of car crashes on the Columbia River Bridge is not accurate. According to the Washington State Department of Transportation, the number of crashes on the bridge is significantly lower. For instance, in 2020, there were approximately 1,000 crashes on the bridge, not 400. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not based on reliable data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that Boston is 60 minutes away from Providence and offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent, while construction costs are similar. This claim is misleading because the distance between Boston and Providence is approximately 45 minutes by car, not 60. Additionally, the claim that Boston offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent is not accurate. Boston does not have a specific subsidy program for developers that allows them to charge higher rent. The claim about the skyline being dominated by cranes is true, as Boston has been experiencing significant construction activity in recent years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that notices were sent to Jews in Ukraine indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews is false. There is no credible evidence or official reports supporting this claim. The Ukrainian government has not implemented such a policy, and it would be against international human rights laws and Ukrainian laws protecting religious freedom.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that the judicial system is the most underfunded in the state and that judges receive some of the richest pensions among public employees is not supported by reliable sources. The funding and pension information for the judicial system would typically be available through official government reports or budget documents, which would provide specific figures and comparisons. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: George Washington, the first President of the United States, was known for his religious beliefs and often referenced God in his speeches and writings.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that if Oregon's legislature authorizes $450 million for the Columbia River Crossing (CRC) project, it will result in Oregon bearing a greater cost responsibility than initially planned. However, the claim does not provide specific details or evidence to support this assertion. Without concrete information on the total cost of the project, the additional costs Oregon might be responsible for, or the funding sources and allocations, it is not possible to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that photos prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership is not accurate. Photos alone cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of ridership.

Photos can provide visual evidence but do not provide quantitative data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 data, Rhode Island does indeed have the highest gambling revenue per capita among all states in the U.S. This is primarily due to the state's legalized gambling industry, which includes casinos, lottery, and other forms of gambling. Therefore, the claim is true.

"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that a pack-a-day smoker spends $1,650 a year on cigarettes.

"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher is the only working farmer currently serving in the House is false. While Rep. Fincher is a farmer, there are other members of Congress who also work in agriculture or have farming backgrounds. For example, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) is a farmer and has served in the House. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Milwaukee police and firefighters receiving 4 percent raises annually while others receive zero or one percent raises is not accurate. Public sector employees, including police and firefighters, often have collective bargaining agreements that determine their salary increases. These agreements are typically negotiated between the unions representing the employees and the city or county governments. While it is possible for certain groups to receive higher raises, it is not accurate to say that this is a routine occurrence for all police and firefighters. The claim seems to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the actual salary negotiation process.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Disney was looking to build Disney World in Miami and was told to ""take a hike"" is false. Disney World was actually built in Orlando, Florida, not Miami.

Therefore, this claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigrants mow the grass around the Texas Capitol is true.

Therefore, the statement that the national debt was reduced every year for the last five years is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Since 1961 our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs"" is not accurate. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the total number of private-sector jobs in the U.S. has fluctuated over time, but it has not consistently been 66 million since 1961. Additionally, the claim that Republicans have created 24 million jobs and Democrats have created 42 million jobs is not supported by any reliable data source. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of job creation statistics.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. tax code does not provide a tax deduction for companies that close down American factories and offices and move those jobs overseas.

"Explanation: The claim that ""We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day"" is false. The baby boomer generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is a large cohort, but the number of baby boomers retiring each day is not 10,000. The actual number of baby boomers retiring each day is much lower, typically around 10,000 per day, but this is a general estimate and not an exact figure. The claim exaggerates the number significantly.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of crime statistics. The U.K. figure of over 2,000 crimes per 100,000 population is a general crime rate, while the U.S. figure of 466 violent crimes per 100,000 is a specific type of crime rate. These two figures are not directly comparable because they measure different things. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: Mercury is indeed present in compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), and if a CFL bulb is broken, it can release mercury vapor. However, the amount of mercury released is very small and not enough to pose a significant health risk. The primary concern with broken CFLs is the glass shards and the potential for electrical shock. The claim that you should throw away your shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them is an exaggeration. It is recommended to clean up the broken bulb carefully, using a damp cloth to avoid inhaling mercury vapor, and to dispose of the bulb according to local regulations.

Freshmen lawmakers are those who have been elected for the first time, and they indeed account for one-third of the House. Additionally, two-thirds of the chamber having two years or less experience is a common observation in the House, as many members are elected for the first time or have limited prior experience.

Kohls is a retail store that sells a variety of products, including clothing, but their prices are typically higher than one dollar.

The claim as stated is an oversimplification and may not accurately reflect the full scope of the tax plan.

"Explanation: The claim that unemployment in Ohio is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and that it has always been that way is not accurate. Ohio is a right-to-work state, which means that workers cannot be required to join a union as a condition of employment. The unemployment rate in Ohio can vary over time and is influenced by numerous factors, including economic conditions, industry trends, and labor market dynamics.

"Explanation: The claim that Florida was the only state to go from AA to AAA in its bond rating during a specific eight-year period is not accurate. While Florida's bond rating has improved over time, it is not the only state to have achieved an AAA rating. Other states, such as New York and Massachusetts, have also received AAA ratings. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a loophole allowing members of Congress and high-powered executive branch appointees to exploit insider knowledge of the financial industry for personal profit. While it is true that insider trading is illegal and can lead to severe penalties, the claim does not provide specific evidence or examples of such a loophole. Furthermore, the U.S. government has strict regulations and oversight mechanisms in place to prevent and detect insider trading. Therefore, the claim is not supported by concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""we have automatic citizenship upon birth"" is true, but the statement that ""we are the only country in the world that has it"" is false.

However, the specific details and conditions for automatic citizenship can vary significantly from country to country.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim about the number of annual gun purchases in Rhode Island is not accurate. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the number of background checks conducted for firearm purchases in Rhode Island in 2020 was approximately 10,000. This number is often used as a proxy for the number of gun purchases, as each background check typically corresponds to one firearm purchase. Therefore, the claim that there are approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island is an exaggeration.

"Explanation: The claim that it will cost $50,000 per enrollee in Obamacare over the next 10 years is false. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is a complex piece of legislation that has been subject to various analyses and cost estimates. The $50,000 figure is not supported by any credible sources or official estimates. The actual costs associated with the Affordable Care Act are much lower and vary depending on the specific provisions and the overall healthcare system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a subjective statement that expresses an opinion rather than a factual statement. The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department does not make such value judgments about neighborhoods. Instead, HUD focuses on policies and programs related to housing and urban development.

The term ""missed votes"" typically refers to votes that a member of Congress did not cast, either because they were absent or because they chose not to vote. However, the claim does not specify the context or the type of votes that were ""missed."" Additionally, there is no credible source provided to support this claim.

"Explanation: The claim about Texas prosecutor Rosemary Lehmberg purchasing 72 bottles of vodka in just one store over a year is false. This claim was debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations, including Snopes and FactCheck.org.

The actual number of bottles purchased was significantly lower, and the claim was used to discredit Lehmberg during her political campaign.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not release a statement on the death of Robin Williams before a statement on Michael Brown. In fact, President Obama released a statement on the death of Michael Brown on August 10, 2014, and a statement on the death of Robin Williams on August 11, 2014. The order of the statements is reversed in the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Ronald Reagan became a Republican in 1962, after serving as a Democrat and then an Independent. The claim that someone became a Republican sooner in their life than Ronald Reagan did in his is false because it is not possible to have become a Republican before 1962.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. English is indeed the de facto national language of the United States, but it is not the official language. The U.S. Constitution does not designate an official language, and federal law does not require the use of English in any official capacity. In fact, the U.S. Census Bureau allows respondents to answer questions in any language they prefer. Additionally, many states and cities have laws that allow the use of multiple languages on ballots and other official documents. Therefore, the claim that making English official would prevent the use of other languages in places like New York City is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific Gallup poll result, but it's important to note that Gallup polls are not always representative of the entire population and can vary based on the sample size and methodology. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific details about the poll, such as the exact wording of the question, the sample size, or the time period of the poll. Without these details, it's difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Chicago takes more guns off the streets than New York or Los Angeles is not accurate. According to data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, Chicago has a higher rate of gun-related crimes compared to New York and Los Angeles.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has indeed proposed the idea of building a mirror system in space to reflect sunlight back to Earth. This concept is part of a broader proposal to address climate change and improve the Earth's habitability. The idea is to place large mirrors in space to redirect sunlight towards the Earth, potentially increasing the planet's temperature and helping to mitigate the effects of global warming. While the feasibility and practicality of this idea are still subjects of scientific debate, the claim that Gingrich has suggested this is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that allowing brewpubs to sell beer in Georgia could lead to a situation where only a couple of manufacturers control the market, similar to Mexico. However, this claim is misleading and not supported by evidence. The brewpub industry is typically small-scale and local, with many independent operators. The market is not likely to consolidate into a few large manufacturers. Additionally, Georgia's alcohol laws and regulations are distinct from Mexico's, and the comparison is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Commercial nuclear power has not resulted in any deaths of the American public. While there have been incidents like the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, these were not commercial nuclear power plants in the United States.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim about the people in Massachusetts liking the state health care plan by a 3-1 margin is not supported by any specific data or survey results. While there may be general support for the state's health care initiatives, a 3-1 margin is a specific and quantifiable claim that requires evidence to support it. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be considered true.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama is trying to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is false. President Obama did not attempt to pack the court.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that less than half of 1 percent of all Texas legislators who ever served draw a benefit from pensions tied to the salaries of state district judges. This claim is difficult to verify without specific data on the number of legislators who have served and the number of those who receive such pensions. However, the claim is phrased in a way that suggests a very small percentage, which is typically difficult to achieve in large groups. Therefore, without concrete evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is likely true, as it is a small fraction of the total number of legislators.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Rep. Tammy Duckworth has been a staunch supporter of expanding the spending, size, and reach of the IRS is not accurate. While Rep. Duckworth has advocated for increased funding for the IRS to improve its ability to enforce tax laws and collect revenues, she has not been a strong proponent of expanding the IRS's size or reach beyond its current scope. Her primary focus has been on improving the IRS's efficiency and effectiveness, rather than advocating for a significant increase in its size or scope.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that federal bureaucrats could take over local building code enforcement due to non-compliance with energy efficiency legislation. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the role of federal regulations in local building codes. Federal energy efficiency legislation typically provides guidelines and incentives, but does not give the federal government the authority to directly enforce local building codes.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 97 percent of scientists believe humans are causing climate change has been widely cited and supported by numerous studies. The claim that this number was pulled out of thin air is false. The head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has not debunked this claim. The IPCC's reports consistently state that the consensus among scientists is that humans are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Federal spending is not entirely discretionary. While some spending, such as defense and non-defense discretionary spending, can be adjusted annually through the budget process, mandatory spending, which includes Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, is not discretionary. These programs are funded automatically based on formulas in the law, and Congress does not have the discretion to change the law to alter these spending levels in the same way it does for discretionary spending.

"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, during his presidential campaign, Romney stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop"" by political opponents.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that judges are using Shariah law in Dearborn, Michigan is false. Dearborn, like all other cities in the United States, operates under the U.S. legal system, which is based on common law and federal and state constitutions. There is no evidence to suggest that Shariah law is being used in Dearborn or any other city in the U.S. This claim is a misinterpretation of the fact that Dearborn has a significant Muslim population and some local businesses may operate under Islamic principles, but this does not extend to the legal system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that John doesn't have a record in the Senate and that he has only passed four bills, all of which are about post offices. This claim is false because it is not possible to have a record in the Senate without passing any bills. Additionally, the claim that John has only passed four bills is not accurate as it is not specified which bills were passed or the context in which they were passed.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: According to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, Georgia ranks 10th among states with the highest number of uninsured people. Therefore, the claim that Georgia has the fifth-highest number of uninsured people is false.

"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed shifted his stance on abortion over time. In the past, he has supported abortion rights, including a statement in 2012 where he said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" However, in recent years, he has become more vocal about his opposition to abortion, aligning himself with the pro-life movement. Therefore, the claim that he is now ""pro-life"" is accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""three companies got 90 percent of that"" is misleading. It implies that the three companies (CVS and two others) received 90% of the $35 million, which would be $31.5 million. However, the claim does not specify how much each of the three companies received, nor does it provide evidence that the two companies not located in Rhode Island received a significant portion of the $35 million. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as it stands.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The largest structural deficit in Wisconsin's history was in the 2011-2012 fiscal year, not two years ago. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the fiscal year 2019-2020, which had a structural deficit of $1.3 billion, but this was not the largest in Wisconsin's history.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Scott allowed Republican legislators to cut his teacher pay raise proposal by 60 percent is false. In 2018, Gov. Scott proposed a $1,000 raise for teachers, but the Florida Legislature ultimately approved a $1,000 raise for teachers in the 2019-2020 school year. The proposal was not cut by 60 percent; instead, it was reduced by $500, which is a 33.33% reduction from the original proposal. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The New York Times, like any other news organization, can be sued for defamation if they publish false information that harms someone's reputation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida students take an array of standardized high-stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year is an exaggeration. While standardized testing does take up a significant amount of time in Florida schools, the 45 school days figure is not accurate. According to the Florida Department of Education, the average student in Florida spends about 20-25 days per year on standardized testing, which is a significant portion of the school year but not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Security Agency (NSA) is authorized to collect certain types of communications data, including phone calls, under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This section allows the NSA to collect ""any tangible thing"" relevant to a foreign intelligence investigation, including phone records. However, the NSA must obtain a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to collect such data. This process is different from the FISA warrant process, which is used for surveillance of individuals suspected of espionage or terrorism. Therefore, the claim that it is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans' phone calls without a specific FISA warrant is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States is ""seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s"" is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other economic studies. According to these sources, income inequality in the U.S. has been increasing since the 1970s, with the top 1% of earners capturing a larger share of the total income. However, the claim that this level of inequality is greater than any time since the 1920s is not accurate. The 1920s was a period of significant income inequality, but the current level of inequality is not as high as it was during that time.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that amniocentesis results more often than not in abortion in this country is false. Amniocentesis is a procedure used to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus. The results of the test are used to make informed decisions about the pregnancy, but the decision to terminate the pregnancy is not a result of the test itself. The test is performed to provide information, and the decision to terminate the pregnancy is made by the parents based on that information. Therefore, the claim that amniocentesis results more often than not in abortion is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by former U.S. President Barack Obama. The statement itself is a subjective assessment of Iran's threat level, which can vary based on political, military, and diplomatic perspectives. While Iran is not considered a superpower in the traditional sense, it does pose significant regional and international threats due to its nuclear program, support for militant groups, and geopolitical influence. Therefore, the claim is true.

"Explanation: The claim is false. John Boehner, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has not called for repealing the entire stimulus package, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle-class people.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is comparing two unrelated phenomena: the number of people who have seen UFOs and the approval rating of George W. Bush's presidency. These two topics are not directly related, and there is no evidence to suggest that the number of people who have seen UFOs is related to the approval rating of a former president. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Zephyr Teachout, a political candidate, has publicly stated her opposition to Super PACs, which are political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. However, it is possible for candidates to accept donations from individuals or groups that support Super PACs, as long as the candidate does not directly benefit from the Super PAC's activities. The claim suggests that Teachout is against Super PACs but has taken money from Super PAC donors, which is a nuanced issue. Without specific evidence of Teachout directly benefiting from Super PAC funds, the claim is difficult to verify as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not say she was under attack in Bosnia and then found out it was young girls handing her flowers. This is a misinterpretation of a genuine event. In 1996, Clinton was in Bosnia and was greeted by a group of young girls who handed her flowers. She did not describe this as an attack.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that drug testing for welfare recipients will save money is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies have shown that the costs of implementing drug testing programs often outweigh the savings. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other organizations have criticized drug testing programs for welfare recipients, arguing that they are ineffective and costly. Furthermore, the potential savings are often overstated, and the programs can lead to increased administrative burdens and legal challenges.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that New Hampshire's second congressional district includes two counties where at least 5% of residents are enrolled in the state's expanded Medicaid program. To verify this, I would need to check the specific enrollment data for the counties within New Hampshire's second congressional district. However, based on general information, it is known that New Hampshire has expanded Medicaid, and some counties may have higher enrollment rates. Without specific data, it is difficult to confirm the exact percentage for the two counties mentioned.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Dr. Paul, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, has voted for legislation that is not expressly authorized by the Constitution. For example, he has voted for bills related to healthcare, education, and other areas that are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. The Constitution does not provide a list of topics that Congress can or cannot legislate on, and the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress has the power to legislate on any subject not explicitly prohibited by the Constitution.

"Explanation: The claim that President Obama flip-flopped on warrantless wiretapping is false. During his presidential campaign, Obama criticized President George W. Bush's warrantless wiretapping program, stating that it was unconstitutional and violated privacy rights. However, after taking office, Obama continued and expanded the program, arguing that it was necessary for national security. This is a well-documented shift in policy, but it does not constitute a ""flip-flop"" in the sense of changing one's position on a specific issue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a national study of 2,500 charter schools, which suggests that 20% of these schools perform better than community public schools, 40% perform worse, and the remaining 40% have no significant difference.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing the job losses during the Great Recession (2007-2009) to the combined job losses of the last four recessions before it. The Great Recession resulted in a net loss of approximately 8.8 million jobs, while the combined job losses of the previous four recessions (1980-1982, 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009) were around 5.5 million jobs. Therefore, the claim that we lost more jobs in the Great Recession than the last four recessions combined is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest disparity of income in the country is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement made by budget analysts, which is a common perspective in economic discussions. However, it is not specific enough to be definitively true or false without more context. Budget analysts often use models and projections to predict the economic impact of tax hikes and spending cuts, but their predictions can vary based on assumptions and methodologies. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false without additional specific data or context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""When Pakistan erupted in crisis, I spoke to Musharraf before Bush did"" is a statement made by former U.S. President George W. Bush. This claim is often used to highlight Bush's direct involvement in the situation and his immediate response to the crisis. However, the claim itself is not verifiable through independent sources and is based on Bush's own account. Without additional evidence or verification from other sources, it is difficult to definitively confirm the claim's truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, threatened to secede from the United States is false.

"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold said that with Obamacare, we could keep our doctors and our plans, and that it was rated as the Lie of the Year, is false. Russ Feingold, a former U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, did not make this statement. The claim is a misattribution of a statement made by President Obama during the 2009 healthcare reform debate. The statement was later rated as the ""Lie of the Year"" by PolitiFact, but it was not made by Russ Feingold.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Houston is home to more doctors, more nurses, and more researchers than any other place in the world is not accurate. While Houston is a major medical hub with several renowned hospitals and research institutions, it does not have the highest number of doctors, nurses, or researchers globally. For instance, cities like New York, London, and Tokyo have larger populations and more healthcare professionals. Additionally, the claim does not specify the criteria for ""more"" (e.g., per capita, total number, etc.), which makes it difficult to verify without additional context.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Bill White did not pay taxes while earning $133,600 as deputy secretary of energy is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. tax code is 80,000 pages is often cited but is not accurate. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is indeed extensive, but the total length of the tax code, including regulations and other related documents, is estimated to be around 70,000 pages. This discrepancy is often due to the inclusion of various regulations and other documents that are not part of the IRC itself.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Fox News gave Republican senators twice the air time as Democrats during a hearing about the Islamic State is not supported by any credible sources or evidence.

According to the U.S. Treasury Department's data, in fiscal year 2021, the total interest paid on the federal debt was approximately $370 billion, while total tax revenue was around $3.5 trillion. Therefore, the interest paid on the federal debt is significantly less than total tax revenue.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Supreme Court did not decide in 1982 that non-citizen children must get free K-12 education. The landmark case that addressed this issue is Plyler v. Doe (1982), where the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot deny undocumented children access to a free public education. However, the ruling did not specify that non-citizen children must get free K-12 education; it only ensured that they could not be excluded from public schools.

According to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there are 61 nuclear power plants in the United States, and the majority of these plants are located in states with large populations, such as California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. However, the population density around these plants varies, and it is not accurate to say that most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States has doubled its exports under President Barack Obama is not accurate. While exports did increase during his presidency, they did not double. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. exports increased from $1.5 trillion in 2009 to $2.3 trillion in 2016, which is an increase of about 53% over the eight years of his presidency, not a doubling.

"Explanation: The claim that the last time there was a sustained surge of confidence in governments' competence was under Ronald Reagan is not accurate. While Ronald Reagan's presidency did see a period of increased confidence in the U.S. government, particularly in economic matters, this was not the last time such a surge occurred. For instance, the post-World War II era saw a significant surge in confidence in governments' competence, and more recently, the post-2008 financial crisis period has also seen a resurgence of confidence in governments' ability to manage economic recovery and stability. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Senator Obama has never had a serious Republican challenger is false. Barack Obama, who later became the 44th President of the United States, was a Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. During his time in the Senate, he faced several Republican challengers in his 2008 Senate re-election campaign. The most notable challenger was Alan Keyes, who ran against Obama in the 2004 Senate election and again in 2008. Therefore, the claim that he has never had a serious Republican challenger is incorrect.

"Explanation: The claim that the Colorado caucus system for selecting Republican delegates is rigged is a complex issue that has been debated among political observers and participants. The Colorado caucus system involves local precinct meetings where voters select delegates to represent them at the county and state conventions. While there have been allegations of irregularities and concerns about the fairness of the process, there is no widely accepted evidence or consensus that the system is ""rigged"" in a way that systematically disadvantages one group or candidate. The system's rules and procedures are publicly available, and any irregularities are typically investigated by the relevant authorities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Every 28 hours an unarmed black person is shot by a cop"" is a misinterpretation of a study conducted by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and the NAACP. The study found that a black person is killed by police every 28 hours, but it does not specify that the person is unarmed. The claim is often used to highlight the disproportionate impact of police violence on the black community, but it is not accurate to say that every 28 hours an unarmed black person is shot by a cop.

The actual flow rates of water into and out of Lake Erie vary significantly based on factors such as weather patterns, seasonal changes, and human activities.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that San Antonio has seen a 67% growth in water customers in the last 25 years, but there is 0% more water used.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to multiple news reports and official statements, the crowd size at Trump's rally in Phoenix on June 18, 2020, was estimated to be around 15,000 to 20,000 people.

Global temperature records show that the last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, with 2016, 2019, and 2020 being the three warmest years ever recorded. This trend is consistent with the long-term warming trend observed over the past century, primarily driven by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution is false. Evolution is a well-established scientific theory that explains how species change over time. Gorillas are a species of great apes that have evolved from a common ancestor with humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos. The existence of gorillas does not contradict the theory of evolution; rather, it is a result of the evolutionary process. The claim seems to misunderstand the relationship between evolution and the diversity of species.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. George Allen, a former U.S. Senator from Virginia, did not vote to add $3 trillion to the federal debt. He voted to raise the debt ceiling four times, but this is a routine vote that occurs when the debt limit is reached and needs to be increased to allow the government to continue borrowing money. Additionally, he voted for the No Child Left Behind Act, which is a true statement. However, the claim that he voted to add $3 trillion to the federal debt is incorrect.

The bill focused on border security, legalization of undocumented immigrants, and other immigration-related reforms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that it makes no difference whether children are raised by heterosexual or homosexual parents is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex nature of family dynamics and child development. While numerous studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents in terms of emotional well-being, academic achievement, and overall development, it is not accurate to say that it makes no difference. The claim ignores the unique experiences and challenges that children in same-sex parent households may face, such as potential stigma, lack of societal acceptance, and the need for additional support. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Wisconsin law does not prevent a candidate from removing their name from the ballot for re-election to Congress. Wisconsin Statutes § 12.01(1) allows candidates to withdraw from a primary or general election by filing a written withdrawal with the appropriate election official. Therefore, the claim that he cannot remove his name from the ballot for re-election to Congress is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that under Governor Mitt Romney's definition, Donald Trump is a small business. However, this claim is misleading because it implies a direct comparison or equivalence between Romney's definition and Trump's business status. Romney's definition of a small business typically refers to businesses with a certain number of employees or annual revenue, which does not directly apply to Trump's business empire. Trump's businesses are large corporations, not small businesses as defined by Romney's criteria.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a misunderstanding of the Iran nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The agreement does not limit Iran to the number of centrifuges needed for a weapon but rather limits the number of centrifuges Iran can use for its nuclear program. The agreement allows Iran to have a certain number of centrifuges for peaceful purposes, but it also includes strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama did not attack John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is solid through about 2040 without any changes whatsoever is false. The Social Security Administration has reported that the program's trust funds will be depleted by 2034, and the program will only be able to pay 75% of its benefits after that point. This is due to the increasing number of retirees and the decreasing number of workers paying into the system. The Social Security Administration has also stated that changes will be needed to ensure the program's long-term solvency.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that if you are from Guatemala and are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed, is not accurate. While it is true that Mexico has strict immigration policies and illegal entry can result in detention, the claim that this automatically leads to jail time is an oversimplification. Detention centers are often used for processing and deportation, but not all individuals are jailed indefinitely. The process involves legal proceedings and the possibility of release on bail or other conditions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama wants to raise the lowest income tax rate from 10 to 15 percent is false.

In fact, his administration focused on reducing the tax burden for low- and middle-income Americans.

"Explanation: The claim that all travelers, including babies, arriving in the U.S. by air must have a passport is false. While it is true that U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) must have a passport or other acceptable identification to enter the U.S., there are exceptions for minors. Children under 16 can enter the U.S. with a valid passport or a certified copy of their birth certificate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that tailpipe emissions rules, if fully implemented, will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit by 2050 is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. Tailpipe emissions regulations are part of broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, but their impact on temperature rise is not as precise as the claim suggests. The reduction in temperature rise would be more significant in terms of preventing further warming rather than a specific reduction of nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit by 2050.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Michael Thurmond is a former Georgia State Senator and has indeed authored legislation that has provided tax relief to Georgia's senior citizens and working families.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that none of the $400 million proposed by the City of Austin for road projects will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that John McCain accused Barack Obama of ""letting infants die"" is false.

The claim is a misrepresentation of McCain's actual statements.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown voted six times to raise his own pay is false. Sherrod Brown is a U.S. Senator from Ohio, and senators' salaries are set by law and are not determined by individual votes. The salary for a U.S. Senator is currently $174,000 per year, and this amount is set by Congress as a whole, not by individual senators voting on their own pay.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The latest unemployment numbers do not indicate that nearly 315,000 Americans have given up hope when it comes to finding a job. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports the unemployment rate, which is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The number of people who are unemployed is a subset of the labor force, and it does not include those who have given up looking for work. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the unemployment data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the changes to Georgia's tax and fee structure are an overall tax cut is not accurate. While there may be specific tax cuts or reductions in certain areas, the overall impact on the tax burden can vary depending on individual circumstances and the specific changes made. Therefore, it is not accurate to label the entire tax and fee structure change as an overall tax cut.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years is based on a study conducted by the Pew Research Center. The study found that the number of gun homicides in the U.S. decreased from 18,255 in 2006 to 9,663 in 2018, a decrease of 47%. This is a significant reduction, but the claim states a 49% decrease, which is slightly inaccurate. Therefore, the claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that ""there's no money in Social Security"" is false. Social Security is a federal program in the United States that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible individuals.

"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney and his staff purchased computer hard drives for $100,000 is false. The actual cost of the hard drives was $1,000, not $100,000. This misinformation likely stems from a misunderstanding or deliberate exaggeration of the actual cost.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican-led softening of firearms training rules does not mean that untrained individuals would be allowed to carry guns with a state permit. The claim misrepresents the actual changes in the rules. The changes typically involve reducing the number of hours required for training or allowing for online training, but they still require some form of training before an individual can obtain a permit to carry a gun.

"Explanation: The claim that if all of the Bush-era tax cuts expire on schedule, the budget will be close to being balanced in four years, is based on a simplified economic model. However, it does not account for several factors that could affect the budget balance, such as changes in economic growth, inflation, and potential adjustments to other tax policies or spending programs. Additionally, the expiration of tax cuts would likely have a significant impact on individual and corporate tax liabilities, which could lead to economic adjustments that might not result in a balanced budget within four years. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and cannot be considered entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that children do best with a mom and a dad is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex nature of family structures and their impact on child development. Research in social sciences has shown that various family structures, including single-parent households, same-sex parent households, and blended families, can also provide a nurturing and supportive environment for children. The well-being of children is more closely tied to factors such as parental involvement, economic stability, and emotional support, rather than the specific gender composition of their parents.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that from May 5 to May 9, 1,100 soldiers committed suicide, with one suicide every 36 hours. This claim is false because it is not possible for 1,100 soldiers to commit suicide in just 5 days. The average number of soldiers committing suicide per day would be 220, which is an unrealistic and unsustainable figure. Additionally, the claim does not provide any credible source or evidence to support the statement.

The ACA's funding mechanisms were designed to be revenue-neutral, meaning the costs were offset by the new revenue sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Assembly did not vote to take funding away from public schools to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools. The voucher program is funded separately from the state's general education funding, and the Assembly's budget decisions do not directly impact the funding for public schools or private voucher schools.

"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been consistently lower than the national average during Walker's tenure as governor.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that this is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression is based on the comparison of the current economic recovery to the period following the Great Depression. While the current recovery has been slow and uneven, it is not accurate to say it is the worst since the Great Depression. The Great Depression was characterized by a much more severe and prolonged economic downturn, with unemployment rates reaching over 25% in the United States. In contrast, the current recovery has seen unemployment rates peak at around 14.8% in April 2020 and has since been declining. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is asking whether the governor of Massachusetts should be able to appoint an interim U.S. senator. In the United States, the appointment of a U.S. senator is typically made by the state's governor, but this appointment is usually for a temporary period until a special election can be held. The claim does not specify the context or the reason for the appointment, so it is not possible to definitively say whether the governor should be able to make this appointment. However, the general practice is that governors can appoint interim senators, so the claim is not necessarily false.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Voting instructions provided to voters in elections typically include information about the limitations of the master lever, also known as the ""straight ticket"" option. This option allows voters to cast their vote for all candidates of a particular party with a single mark. The instructions usually specify that this option does not include all candidates or that it may not be available for all races. Therefore, the claim that there is nothing in the voting instructions about the limitations of the master lever is incorrect.

Answer: 0"

Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: N/A"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) does not have a ""slush fund"" for spaying and neutering pets. The Affordable Care Act is a healthcare reform law that primarily focuses on expanding access to health insurance and improving the quality of healthcare services. There is no provision in the law that allows for the use of funds for pet spaying and neutering, nor is there any evidence to suggest that such a program has been implemented or funded through the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is partially true but misleading. During George W. Bush's administration, the U.S. experienced a significant economic downturn, including the Great Recession, which led to a loss of millions of jobs per month. However, the claim does not specify the exact time frame, which could be misleading. Under Barack Obama's administration, the U.S. did experience a period of job growth, with hundreds of thousands of jobs added per month during the recovery period. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of job growth under Obama, it is misleading in its comparison to the Bush administration without specifying the time frame.

"Explanation: The claim that Ron Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas is false. Ron Johnson, a former CEO of J.C. Penney and a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has been known to support various economic policies, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he voted five times for tax breaks specifically designed to help companies move jobs overseas. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his voting record.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that taxpayers pay $18,000 a month for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco is false. The U.S. House of Representatives does not provide monthly figures for individual members' district offices. The cost of maintaining a district office is typically funded through campaign funds and not directly from taxpayers. Additionally, the claim does not provide a source or citation to support the $18,000 figure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that reducing obesity rates to 1980 levels would directly translate to a trillion dollars saved in Medicare costs. However, this is a simplification that overlooks several factors. Obesity is just one of many factors contributing to healthcare costs, and reducing obesity rates would not necessarily lead to a direct trillion-dollar savings. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential costs of implementing and maintaining a program to reduce obesity rates to 1980 levels. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about the additional cost of a surcharge on student loans. However, the claim does not specify which surcharge is being referred to, nor does it provide any context or source for the figures.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that a federal plan to expand Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over 10 years is based on a study conducted by the Florida Policy Institute. The study estimated that the expansion of Medicaid in Florida would cost the state $26 billion over a decade. However, this cost is not borne solely by Florida taxpayers; it is a shared responsibility between the federal government and the state. The federal government would cover a significant portion of the costs, with the state contributing a smaller amount. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of the total cost, it is misleading to attribute the entire $26 billion to Florida taxpayers.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do is supported by numerous studies and reports. For instance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics has shown that African-Americans are arrested at a higher rate than whites for similar offenses. Additionally, studies have found that African-Americans are more likely to receive harsher sentences, even for similar crimes. This disparity is often attributed to systemic biases in the criminal justice system.

"Explanation: Wisconsin does allow voters to change their early ballot if they realize they've made a mistake. This process is known as ""curing"" the ballot. The voter can contact their local clerk's office to request a replacement ballot. The original ballot is then voided, and the voter can cast a new one. This process is designed to ensure that voters' intentions are accurately reflected in the election results.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Kurt Schrader cast the deciding vote that failed to extend tax cuts for Oregon's middle-class families and small businesses is false. Kurt Schrader, a Democratic representative from Oregon, voted against the tax cut extension, but he did not cast the deciding vote. The deciding vote was cast by another representative, and the bill ultimately failed due to a lack of support from Democrats.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Governor Scott Walker openly backing a move to abolish the state retirement system and convert it to a 401(k)-style plan, which would reduce pensions by at least a third for current and retired public employees, is false. While Governor Walker has proposed changes to the state's retirement system, including a shift towards a 401(k)-style plan, he has not openly backed a move that would reduce pensions by at least a third. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresentation of his actual proposals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) does indeed limit the enrichment of uranium to the five recognized nuclear weapon states (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States). The treaty allows these states to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, but it also requires them to limit the spread of nuclear weapons technology to other countries. Non-nuclear weapon states are required to accept safeguards on their nuclear activities to ensure they are not developing nuclear weapons.

"Explanation: The claim that Congress has cut funding for veterans benefits over the last years is not accurate. In fact, the U.S. government has been increasing funding for veterans benefits. For instance, the VA budget has been increasing in recent years, with the 2021 budget being the largest in history. Additionally, the VA has been receiving additional funding through various legislative measures, such as the VA Mission Act and the VA Maintain Act, which aim to improve veterans' healthcare and benefits.

"Explanation: The claim that ""fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges these days can't find jobs"" is not supported by reliable data. While it is true that liberal arts graduates may face challenges in the job market, the specific percentage of 53% is not widely reported or verified by credible sources. According to various studies and reports, the unemployment rate for liberal arts graduates is generally lower than the claim suggests, and the majority of graduates do find employment, often in fields related to their interests and skills.

"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has led the nation in student fatalities caused by motorists illegally passing stopped school buses is not accurate. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Georgia does not consistently rank as the state with the highest number of student fatalities due to motorists illegally passing stopped school buses. The NHTSA's data shows that other states, such as California and Texas, have higher rates of such incidents. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on an estimate from Governing magazine, which is a reputable source for public policy and management news.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Florida Democrats put your Social Security number and your wife's Employment Identification Number in a mail piece is highly unlikely. There is no legitimate reason for a political party to use personal identification numbers in a mail piece, and it would be illegal and unethical to do so.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Oregon ranks 30th in the nation with regard to its incarceration rate can be evaluated by checking the latest data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics or the Prison Policy Initiative. As of the latest available data, Oregon's incarceration rate is indeed relatively low compared to other states, but the exact ranking can vary slightly depending on the specific year and methodology used. However, the claim that Oregon ranks 30th specifically is not supported by the most recent data.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that ""creeping defense commitments in (the Middle East) and globally now consume over half the U.S. discretionary budget annually"" is misleading. While it is true that the U.S. spends a significant portion of its discretionary budget on defense, the claim that it consumes over half is an exaggeration. According to the latest data from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the defense budget is around 15-20% of the discretionary budget, not over half. The claim also does not specify the time period or the source of the data, making it difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Politicians and corporate lobbyists do not have the power to take away an individual's right to spend their paycheck as they wish. The government can impose taxes and regulations, but these are not the same as taking away the right to spend money. The claim is a misinterpretation of the role of government and corporate influence.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act is not accurate. While polls have shown that a majority of Latinos support the DREAM Act, the exact percentage varies. For instance, a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Latinos supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which includes the DREAM Act. However, the claim that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act is an exaggeration. Additionally, Marco Rubio has expressed support for the DREAM Act in the past, but he has also opposed certain aspects of it, such as the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Therefore, the claim that Marco Rubio opposes the DREAM Act is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005. In a speech, he said, ""If the Islamic Republic of Iran decides to use its nuclear power, it will be for the benefit of the entire world."" He did not explicitly threaten to use a nuclear weapon against Israel or the United States. The claim misrepresents his statement and exaggerates his intentions.

"Explanation: The claim that Georgia lawmakers ""fuel up for the session by feasting on wild hogs"" is a humorous and exaggerated statement.

Without such data, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that a significant portion of prisoners are incarcerated for less than a year, and that some are locked up for not paying child support. While it is true that some people are incarcerated for short periods, the claim that ""a little less than half"" of prisoners are in for less than a year is not supported by reliable data. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2019, about 40% of state prisoners were sentenced to less than a year. However, the claim that ""we are locking them up in the state pen"" for not paying child support is misleading, as child support violations typically result in fines or other penalties, not jail time.

"Explanation: The claim that this is the slowest job recovery since Hoover is comparing the current job recovery to the period following the Great Depression under President Herbert Hoover. The Great Depression was a severe economic crisis that lasted from 1929 to 1939, and the job recovery during that time was indeed very slow. However, the current job recovery, following the COVID-19 pandemic, has been slower than the recovery after the Great Recession of 2008, but not necessarily slower than the recovery after the Great Depression. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as it stands.

"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, during his presidential campaign, Romney stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin women are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job is a misinterpretation of the gender wage gap. The gender wage gap refers to the difference in earnings between men and women, and it is often expressed as a percentage. In Wisconsin, the gender wage gap is approximately 81 cents on the dollar, meaning that women earn about 81% of what men earn for the same job. This is a common statistic used to illustrate the gender wage gap, but it does not mean that women are paid 81 cents for every dollar a man earns.

"Explanation: Common Core State Standards (CCSS) are not a federal mandate. They were developed by the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers, and they were adopted voluntarily by individual states. The federal government did not impose these standards on states. The misconception likely arises from the fact that the federal government provided funding and incentives for states to adopt these standards through programs like Race to the Top.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee's police chief can fire officers for ""basically no cause"" is false. In the United States, police officers, like other public employees, are typically protected by civil service laws that provide due process rights.

The specific laws and procedures can vary by jurisdiction, but the general principle of due process applies.

Additionally, there are no public Christian churches in Saudi Arabia, but private worship services can be held in homes or other private spaces with the appropriate permits.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does not estimate that the average cost to every family of four from cap and trade will be $6,800 per year. The CBO has estimated the cost of a cap-and-trade program on households, but the figures are not as high as claimed. For example, in a 2019 report, the CBO estimated that a cap-and-trade program could increase the cost of living for a family of four by $1,000 to $2,000 per year, depending on the specific design of the program.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal government does not spend $46,000 a year per family. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the federal government's spending on various programs. The claim also suggests that reducing spending to $30,000 per family would balance the budget, which is not accurate as the budget deficit is influenced by many factors, not just per-family spending.

The U.S. has a significant military presence in Africa, with operations and bases in various countries. For instance, the U.S. has military operations in Somalia, Djibouti, Kenya, and other nations, often in support of counter-terrorism efforts and regional stability. Additionally, the U.S. has military advisors and trainers in several African countries. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent is inaccurate.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a projection that mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt will consume the entire budget in a few decades. While it is true that these programs are significant and their costs are projected to increase, it is not accurate to say that they will ""eclipse"" the entire budget. The U.S. budget includes many other categories, such as defense, education, and infrastructure, which are not mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame or the exact percentage of the budget that these programs will consume, making it difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the Tax Policy Center, which analyzed the impact of Donald Trump's tax plan. The study found that the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would indeed receive more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent combined. This is because the tax plan proposed by Trump included significant reductions in the top marginal tax rate and the elimination of the estate tax, which primarily benefited high-income individuals.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. PolitiFact does not rank governors based on the number of lies they have told.

The claim that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin was listed as the governor who told the most lies is incorrect, as PolitiFact does not provide such a ranking. Additionally, the claim that Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of ""Lie-en Governors"" is also false, as Politifact does not use such a ranking system.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton's presidency was a hundred times what it was under President Ronald Reagan is false. While Bill Clinton's presidency saw significant economic growth and job creation, the claim of a hundred times the job creation and poverty reduction under Ronald Reagan is an exaggeration. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy created about 22.5 million jobs during Clinton's presidency, while under Reagan, the economy created about 16.5 million jobs. Additionally, the poverty rate decreased from 15.2% in 1993 to 12.7% in 2000 during Clinton's presidency, while under Reagan, the poverty rate decreased from 15.2% in 1980 to 12.8% in 1989. The claim of a hundred times the job creation and poverty reduction is not supported by the data.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has been challenged in court multiple times, but the Supreme Court has ruled on it twice. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the individual mandate was constitutional. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in California v. Texas that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but the rest of the ACA remained intact. Therefore, the claim that ""three courts have found the new health care law constitutional and two have found it unconstitutional"" is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the proposed mine in northern Wisconsin would be built without any government oversight is false. In the United States, mining operations are subject to various regulations and oversight by federal and state agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and state departments of natural resources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that car insurance rates have decreased in New Jersey due to market-based solutions attracting more auto insurers is not supported by reliable data or sources. While it is true that the number of auto insurers in New Jersey has increased over the past decade, this does not necessarily correlate with a decrease in insurance rates. Insurance rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including the cost of claims, the risk profile of drivers, and regulatory environments. Without specific data or studies to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that energy companies spend 0.25 percent on research and development (RD) is not accurate. The actual percentage of revenue spent on RD by energy companies varies widely and is typically much higher than 0.25 percent.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about Wisconsin's finances being on track for a budget surplus this year is based on the state's fiscal year 2021-2022 budget, which was approved in June 2021. The budget projected a surplus of $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ending in June 2022. However, this projection was made before the COVID-19 pandemic's full impact on the state's economy was known. The actual fiscal year 2021-2022 ended with a surplus of $1.1 billion, which was less than the projected surplus. Therefore, while Wisconsin did have a surplus, the claim that it is ""on track"" for a budget surplus this year is not accurate as it was based on a projection that did not fully account for the economic impact of the pandemic.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that every statewide candidate drawing over 43 percent of the vote in a Republican Texas primary won the resulting runoff is not entirely accurate. While it is true that candidates who received over 43 percent of the vote in the primary often had a significant advantage in the runoff, it is not a guarantee that they would win. There have been instances where candidates with over 43 percent of the vote in the primary did not win the runoff. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

The claim of adding close to 68,000 troops is an exaggeration. The increase in the military's size is a result of the National Defense Strategy and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018, which authorized an increase in the size of the military.

"Explanation: President Barack Obama did raise taxes during his presidency. He signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law in 2010, which included a 3.8% tax on net investment income for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. Additionally, he implemented a 0.9% Medicare tax on wages and salaries for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. Therefore, the claim that President Obama has not raised taxes is false.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that the United States has more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world is not accurate. While the U.S. does have a high concentration of scientists and engineers, particularly in certain regions like Silicon Valley and the Boston area, it does not have the highest concentration globally. Countries like Israel and Singapore have higher densities of scientists and engineers per capita and per square mile. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for low- to moderate-income working individuals and families. To be eligible, individuals must meet certain criteria, including having earned income and meeting income limits. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for the EITC because they do not have a valid Social Security number, which is required to claim the credit. Additionally, the claim that they can receive up to $36,000 to $38,000 without paying a dime is misleading, as the EITC is a refundable credit, meaning it can reduce the amount of tax owed or result in a refund, but it does not provide a guaranteed amount of money without any tax liability.

Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and his support for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, are well-documented.

"Explanation: The claim that subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies and that cutting these subsidies would save the U.S. government $45 billion every year is misleading. While it is true that oil and gas companies receive significant subsidies, the percentage of total federal subsidies they receive is not 88%. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), oil and gas subsidies in the U.S. are around 10% of total federal subsidies. Additionally, the claim that cutting these subsidies would save $45 billion annually is an oversimplification and not accurate. The actual savings would depend on various factors, including the specific subsidies being cut and their impact on the economy.

While it is true that the steel industry has become more efficient and automated over time, leading to a decrease in the number of workers needed, the production levels have not remained constant. The steel industry has faced significant fluctuations in production due to economic cycles, trade policies, and other factors. Therefore, the claim that production levels are the same as they ever were is inaccurate.

In contrast, Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves were estimated to be around 266 billion barrels. Since 1 barrel of oil is equivalent to approximately 6.22 barrels of coal, the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia are significantly higher than the coal reserves in the United States.

"Explanation: The 2005 Energy Policy Act, also known as the Energy Bill of 2005, was a significant piece of legislation that aimed to address various aspects of energy policy in the United States. While it included provisions for renewable energy, such as tax credits for wind and solar power, it also expanded the use of nuclear power and promoted the development of liquefied natural gas. Critics argue that the bill was not a significant step forward for clean, renewable energy due to its emphasis on nuclear and natural gas. Therefore, the claim that the 2005 energy bill was a big step backwards on the path to clean, renewable energy is a matter of perspective and interpretation.

"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt is misleading. While the Affordable Care Act did increase the federal deficit in the short term, it also reduced the deficit in the long term. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the ACA would reduce the deficit by $145 billion over the 2016-2025 period. Additionally, the ACA has not significantly contributed to the national debt. The national debt is primarily driven by factors such as tax cuts, spending on defense and social programs, and economic downturns.

While the gun industry does have certain protections, such as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which limits lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers, this is not true for all businesses in America. Many industries have some form of liability protection, and the gun industry is not uniquely protected in this regard.

Such claims are often made in the context of broader investigations or reports from regulatory bodies, and they should be backed by credible sources.

The size of a mine hole can vary greatly depending on the specific project and its scale, but it is unlikely to be larger than an entire district.

Therefore, the claim that the mine hole is bigger than the entire district is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the mine's size.

"Explanation: The claim is a misinterpretation of a quote from President Obama. The full quote is: ""If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."" The ""somebody else"" refers to the infrastructure, laws, and institutions that enable businesses to operate, not to the hard work of the business owners themselves. The quote is often used to criticize Obama's views on business success, but it is not accurate to say that he believes success is solely the result of government and not hard work.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Fox News network, like any other news organization, is subject to the same legal and ethical standards as other media outlets. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it does not give any entity the right to deliberately distort news reports.

The claim that Fox News admits to lying and has the right to do so under the First Amendment is a misrepresentation of the facts and the law.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While Idaho did create a state-based marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, it was not the only Republican-led state to do so.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The pay structure for law enforcement officers typically increases with experience and seniority, not with the duration of time spent on the force.

The pay scale is usually based on rank, experience, and other factors, not the exact duration of time spent on the force.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Only about a third of Texans who enroll in college graduate"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While it is true that graduation rates can vary widely, the claim does not provide specific data or context. According to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the six-year graduation rate for public universities in Texas is around 50%, and for community colleges, it is around 30%. However, these rates can vary significantly depending on the institution and the specific program of study. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate as it does not reflect the full range of graduation rates.

"Explanation: The Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) was established in 2008 to stabilize the financial system during the financial crisis. The total amount allocated to TARP was indeed $700 billion. However, the claim that $325 billion has been spent without purchasing any toxic assets is misleading. The $325 billion figure refers to the amount of money that was not used to purchase toxic assets, not the total amount spent. The program has been used to purchase assets, provide loans, and make investments to stabilize the financial system. Therefore, the claim is false.

"Explanation: Members of the military typically contribute to their pension through a combination of their salary and a percentage of their pay. This is often referred to as the Blended Retirement System (BRS) in the United States, where service members contribute a portion of their pay to their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and receive a defined benefit pension upon retirement.

While it is true that properly inflated tires can improve fuel efficiency, the exact percentage of reduction in oil consumption is not universally agreed upon and varies based on factors such as vehicle type, driving conditions, and tire quality. Therefore, the claim that ""every expert says"" this reduction is 3 to 4 percent is an overstatement.

The claim seems to be an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the financial impact of the deficit.

However, without specific context or verification from a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm whether these figures are indeed the final job numbers for 2011.

Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, in 2020, there were 93,331 drug overdose deaths in the United States, which is indeed a significant number. However, the claim that ""about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day"" is not accurate. To find the average daily deaths, you would divide the total number of deaths by the number of days in a year. In 2020, there were 365 days, so the calculation would be 93,331 / 365 ≈ 256.2 deaths per day, not 120. Additionally, the claim that ""drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms"" is also not accurate. According to the CDC, in 2020, there were 19,580 deaths from firearms, which is less than the 93,331 deaths from drug overdoses.

"Explanation: The claim that every family health insurance policy has a ""$900 hidden tax"" to subsidize health care costs of the uninsured is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not impose a $900 tax on all health insurance policies. Instead, it includes a tax on high-cost health plans, known as the ""Cadillac tax,"" which is not a hidden tax and only applies to certain high-cost plans. Additionally, the ACA does not use a flat tax of $900 to subsidize the uninsured; instead, it uses a combination of subsidies and other mechanisms to help reduce the cost of health insurance for low- and middle-income individuals.

"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds during her campaign for president is false. While it is true that Clinton received significant contributions from various sources, including some from Wall Street and hedge funds, the total amount of $100 million is an exaggeration. According to Federal Election Commission records, Clinton's campaign received approximately $600 million in total contributions during her 2016 presidential campaign.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law by President George W.

"Explanation: The claim that two million new jobs have been created in California since 2011 is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total number of nonfarm jobs in California in 2011 was approximately 11.5 million. By 2021, the number had increased to about 13.5 million. This means that the total number of jobs created in California from 2011 to 2021 is around 2 million, but this is not a new creation since 2011 but rather a cumulative increase over the decade.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific action (replacing 100,000 old toilets) and a resulting water savings (2.4 million gallons per day).

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton invented ISIS or is responsible for ISIS is false. ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), emerged in 2014 as a result of complex political, social, and religious factors in the Middle East. The group's origins can be traced back to the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which led to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the rise of various extremist groups. Hillary Clinton, as a former Secretary of State, was involved in U.S. foreign policy during this period, but there is no credible evidence to suggest that she played a direct role in the creation or growth of ISIS. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked by fact-checking organizations.

"Explanation: The claim that Snitker has been virtually ignored by the major media is subjective and depends on the definition of ""major media"" and ""ignored."" If ""major media"" refers to mainstream news outlets and ""ignored"" means receiving little to no coverage, this claim would be difficult to verify without specific examples or data. However, if ""major media"" is interpreted broadly to include various types of media coverage and ""ignored"" is interpreted as receiving minimal attention, the claim could be true or false depending on the context.

"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. Capitol was built by slaves is false. While it is true that slaves were involved in the construction of the Capitol, they were not the primary workforce. The majority of the labor was done by free workers, including immigrants and skilled craftsmen.

"Explanation: Prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases refers to the authority of immigration officials to decide whether to initiate or pursue legal action against an individual.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate was at its lowest point during Barack Obama's presidency, reaching 3.6% in 2019. This was the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s and was significantly lower than the rates during Jimmy Carter's presidency. Therefore, the number of adults working was higher during Obama's presidency compared to Carter's.

"Explanation: The claim that Miami-Dade has the nation's highest-rated tap water is not accurate. While Miami-Dade County does have high-quality tap water, it is not the highest-rated in the nation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other organizations regularly publish reports on water quality, and Miami-Dade's water quality is generally considered good, but it does not consistently rank as the highest in the nation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is the only president to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare is false. While it is true that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, included provisions that reduced Medicare spending, the total reduction was not $500 billion. The ACA reduced Medicare spending by about $716 billion over 10 years, but this was achieved through a combination of cuts to Medicare providers and other measures, not a single $500 billion cut. Additionally, other presidents have also implemented policies that reduced Medicare spending, such as the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 under President Bill Clinton.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The United States is often considered one of the oldest democracies in the world, but it is not the oldest. The title of the oldest democracy is typically given to the United Kingdom, which has a history of democratic institutions dating back to the Magna Carta in 1215. The United States, while having a long history of democratic principles, was founded in 1776, which is later than the UK's democratic roots.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Senate version of the health reform bill, also known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), does not include a provision that requires every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) enrolled plan to pay a minimum of $1 per month towards reproductive rights, including abortion. The AHCA does not mandate such a payment and does not expand coverage for reproductive health services in this manner.

"Explanation: The claim that the average person will pay $6,000 more a year under Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal is based on a specific analysis of the proposal.

This study was widely cited in news reports and political discussions.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that there are some missing service members from previous and current conflicts, the number is not in the tens of thousands. The Department of Defense's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has been working to find and repatriate missing service members, but the number of missing service members is significantly lower than the claim suggests. As of 2021, the DPAA has accounted for 81% of the 83,000 service members listed as missing from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War. The remaining 19% are still missing, which is approximately 15,600 service members.

"Explanation: The claim that Mike Morell testified to Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS oil fields is due to concerns about global warming is false. Mike Morell, a former CIA deputy director, did testify before Congress in 2015, but he did not make this specific claim. The testimony focused on the broader strategy against ISIS and the challenges of the conflict, but there was no mention of global warming as a reason for not bombing ISIS oil fields.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that gun ownership information could be recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not include provisions for the collection of gun ownership information. The ACA primarily focuses on expanding access to health insurance and improving the quality of healthcare services. There are no provisions in the ACA that authorize the collection of gun ownership data by the federal government or insurance companies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Exit polls are surveys conducted at polling stations to gather information about voters' choices and opinions. While exit polls can provide valuable insights into voting patterns, they are not always accurate and can be influenced by various factors such as sampling bias, non-response bias, and the wording of questions. Therefore, it is not uncommon for exit poll results to vary significantly from actual election outcomes. Additionally, the claim that Democrats receive over 70 percent of LGBT votes in federal elections is a generalization that may not hold true for all elections or regions. Specific exit poll data would be needed to verify this claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country and includes an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons is not accurate.

Additionally, the specific number of weapons banned under the assault weapons ban is not 35.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Romney/Ryan budget would allow interest rates on federal student loans to double is false. The Romney/Ryan budget proposal in 2012 did not include a provision to double the interest rates on federal student loans. Instead, it proposed to cap the interest rates at 8.5% for undergraduate loans and 10.5% for graduate loans, which were lower than the rates at the time. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the budget proposal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the state had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, state spending in the U.S. has been increasing over the past few years, with a total of $1.1 trillion in 2019 and $1.2 trillion in 2020. There is no evidence to support the claim that $13 billion was cut from state spending over two years.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 17 million American children had a pre-existing condition and were uninsurable when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed is false. The ACA was signed into law in 2010, and it included provisions to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions. The claim likely confuses the number of uninsured individuals with the number of people who had pre-existing conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of uninsured children in the U.S. was around 10% in 2010, which translates to approximately 7.5 million children. However, the ACA did not directly address the issue of pre-existing conditions for children specifically, as it primarily focused on adults.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that local Texas chambers of commerce were granted exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarters is false.

"Explanation: Preventive care, such as regular check-ups, screenings, and immunizations, can indeed save money in the long run. By catching health issues early, preventive care can prevent more costly treatments and hospitalizations. This is true for individuals, families, businesses (through health insurance and employee wellness programs), and governments (through reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity). Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that in Florida, it is not illegal for an immediate family member of state officials to benefit from legislation supported by a spouse. This claim is false because Florida, like many other states, has laws against conflicts of interest and improper influence. These laws prohibit public officials from using their position to benefit themselves or their family members. For example, Florida Statutes § 112.314 prohibits public officials from using their official position to secure a special privilege for themselves or others. Therefore, the claim that it is not illegal for an immediate family member to prosper from legislation supported by a spouse is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that scientists are in dispute over whether being gay is a choice is false. The overwhelming consensus among scientists and medical professionals is that sexual orientation is not a choice. The American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, and other major health organizations have stated that sexual orientation is not a choice and is not a mental disorder. The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: The claim that the Koch brothers want to protect tax cuts for companies that ship jobs overseas is a simplification and misrepresentation of their actual stance. The Koch brothers, through their political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, have indeed advocated for lower corporate taxes and less regulation, but their primary focus is on reducing the overall tax burden on businesses, not specifically on companies that ship jobs overseas. They have also been criticized for their role in promoting policies that can lead to job outsourcing, but it's not accurate to say they are solely focused on protecting tax cuts for such companies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that raising income tax rates will likely reduce federal revenues is a complex economic issue that depends on various factors. While it is true that higher tax rates can discourage work and investment, leading to lower tax revenues, this is not always the case. The Laffer Curve, a theoretical representation of the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue, suggests that there is an optimal tax rate that maximizes revenue. However, the actual impact of tax rate changes on federal revenues can vary based on economic conditions, the specific tax rates being considered, and other factors such as tax avoidance strategies and economic growth.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
"Explanation: The claim that there are 3 million jobs that go vacant each month in this country is not accurate.

This figure is based on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Kasich's budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder, is a simplification and exaggeration of the actual tax changes implemented during his tenure as governor of Ohio. While there were some tax increases, they were not as significant as the claim suggests. The tax increases were primarily targeted at businesses, but the impact on the middle class was not as severe as the claim implies. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney used to favor gun control and said he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush is partially true. Romney did support certain gun control measures during his 2012 presidential campaign, such as background checks and a ban on assault weapons. However, he also supported the Second Amendment and has since shifted his stance on gun control. The claim that he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush is a simplification of his political views and does not accurately reflect his current stance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""you don't mention it's also the biggest tax cut in history"" is a misinterpretation of the context. The Morning Joe show on MSNBC often discusses various political and economic topics, including tax policies. The claim that the biggest tax increase in history is also the biggest tax cut in history is a contradiction because a tax increase and a tax cut are opposite actions. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Sarah Palin had ""executive experience"" in the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) is false. While Sarah Palin was involved in the PTA as a member and later served as the president of the Wasilla High School PTA, her role was not an executive position in the broader sense. She did not hold an executive position in the PTA at the national or state level, nor did she have executive experience in the context of a corporate or political executive role.

This information is not consistent with known facts about his activities and is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the newly created Immigration Enforcement Review Board can prosecute and jail violators with the help of the attorney general. However, the role of the Immigration Enforcement Review Board and the attorney general's involvement in immigration enforcement are not typically aligned in this manner. The board is usually responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on immigration cases, while the attorney general's role is more focused on legal policy and guidance. Prosecution and jail time for immigration violations are typically handled by immigration enforcement agencies like ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and the Department of Homeland Security, not the review board or the attorney general.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific dataset from the U.S. Congress, where men hold 80% of the seats in the 117th Congress (2021-2023). This data is accurate and can be verified through official sources such as the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The claim is specific to the 117th Congress and does not generalize to all legislatures or time periods.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding is false. Automobiles contribute to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental issues, but their elimination would not be offset by a single volcanic eruption. Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of ash, gases, and heat, which can have significant environmental impacts, but they do not directly offset the specific environmental issues caused by automobiles.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Virginia public schools have cut 5,000 positions since 2008 is false. According to the Virginia Department of Education, the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions in Virginia public schools has actually increased over the past decade. In 2008, there were approximately 100,000 FTE positions, and by 2020, this number had increased to around 110,000 FTE positions. Therefore, the claim that 5,000 positions have been cut is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific budget proposal by a president, which is a political statement and not a verified fact.

Therefore, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim without further context or official data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks has been debunked is false.

Without specific data, it is difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific data.)"
"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown is an ""Obama rubber stamp"" for supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan is a political statement that can be interpreted differently based on one's perspective. Sherrod Brown, a Democratic Senator from Ohio, has indeed supported various environmental policies, including cap and trade, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, labeling him as a ""rubber stamp"" for Obama and suggesting that these policies are ""job-killing"" is a simplification and a political attack. The effectiveness of cap and trade on job creation is a subject of debate among economists and policymakers, with some arguing that it can create jobs in renewable energy sectors while others argue it can lead to job losses in certain industries.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that driving on average in America this summer will save you about $70 according to Department of Energy figures is misleading. The Department of Energy's Energy Saver 101 guide does not provide specific figures for summer driving savings.

"Explanation: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has indeed expressed concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the Systematic Alienization Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database for verifying citizenship on voter rolls. The SAVE database is used to check the citizenship status of individuals applying for certain government benefits, but it has been criticized for its potential inaccuracies and the risk of including U.S. citizens in its lists of non-citizens. The DHS has acknowledged these limitations and has not claimed that the SAVE database is a foolproof means of verification.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""he did mandate health care for Massachusetts, which is HillaryCare"" is misleading. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, was a federal law that expanded health insurance coverage for Americans. The claim that this is ""HillaryCare"" is a political term used to criticize the ACA, but it is not accurate to say that the ACA was a mandate for Massachusetts alone. Additionally, the claim that he doesn't want to do for America what he did for Massachusetts is a false equivalence, as the ACA was a federal law, not a state-specific mandate.

"Explanation: The claim that the health care reform bill is the largest tax increase in U.S. history is false. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) did introduce new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes were not the largest tax increase in U.S. history.

"Explanation: The claim is comparing civilian casualties in Cambodia with those from American drone attacks. However, the comparison is not directly relevant because the two events are not comparable in nature. The Cambodian conflict involved a complex mix of political, military, and humanitarian factors, while American drone attacks are a specific military tactic used in various conflicts. Without specific data on the number of civilian casualties in Cambodia and the number of civilian casualties from American drone attacks, it is impossible to accurately compare the two. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

In many countries, including the United States, students are allowed to celebrate Christmas and pray in school, as long as it is done in a way that respects the rights and beliefs of all students.

Crist has generally supported the Second Amendment, he has also expressed some nuanced views on gun control and has supported certain measures to address gun violence.

Veterans' benefits are typically managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are not directly tied to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or other health care reforms.

"Explanation: Social Security and Medicare are not a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading. In contrast, Social Security and Medicare are government-run programs funded through payroll taxes and general revenues, with benefits paid to eligible individuals based on their contributions and the program's rules. The funds are managed by the government and are not used to pay off earlier investors.

"Explanation: The claim that ""the majority actually want single-payer health care"" is not universally true. Opinions on healthcare systems, including single-payer systems, vary widely among different populations and regions. While some polls and surveys suggest that a significant portion of people in certain countries or regions support single-payer healthcare, it is not accurate to say that the majority of people worldwide or in any specific country universally want it.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require 100% of Americans to depend on federal payments or government benefits. The ACA aims to provide access to affordable health insurance for all Americans, but it does not eliminate private insurance or require everyone to rely on government benefits. Some people may still choose to purchase private insurance, and others may qualify for government assistance to help with their premiums or out-of-pocket costs. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresents the purpose and effects of the ACA.

In the United States, projects like this typically require approval from multiple federal agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and others.

"Explanation: The claim that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad is not irrefutable in the context of social science. While some studies suggest that children raised by two parents may have certain advantages, such as better academic performance or emotional well-being, these findings are not universally applicable and are often influenced by various factors such as socioeconomic status, family dynamics, and individual differences. Moreover, the notion that children need both parents to thrive is not supported by all research, as many children raised by single parents or in other family structures also thrive and achieve success. Therefore, the claim is not irrefutable.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a quote often attributed to George Washington, but there is no evidence that he actually said these exact words. The quote is more commonly attributed to Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in a letter to William S. Smith in 1787: ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason for the people to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, for self-preservation against tyranny in government."" While the sentiment expressed in the claim is similar to Jefferson's words, it is not a direct quote from Washington.

The 2008 recession had a significant impact on various sectors, and the recovery has been uneven.

"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010 and has significantly altered the healthcare landscape in the United States. It introduced several changes, including the expansion of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance marketplaces, and the requirement for most Americans to have health insurance. While the ACA has had a complex impact on the healthcare system, it has not fundamentally altered the doctor-patient relationship. The core of the relationship remains centered on the patient and their healthcare provider. The ACA has introduced new regulations and requirements, but it has not fundamentally changed the nature of the relationship between doctors and their patients.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Austin is indeed known for its thriving startup scene, with a significant number of venture capital investments and patent filings. According to various reports and rankings, Austin is often considered one of the top cities in Texas for startups and venture capital. However, it's important to note that the claim does not specify a particular metric or time frame, so it's difficult to definitively say that Austin is ""number one"" in Texas across all categories (startups, venture capital, and patents) at any given moment. Therefore, while the claim is largely true, it's not entirely accurate to say that Austin is ""number one"" in Texas in all these categories simultaneously.

Answer: 0.5 (The claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate.)"
"Explanation: The claim that stimulus money went to studying ants in Africa is false.

The federal government does offer income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs, but these are not the same as refinancing.

"Explanation: The claim that ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected, specifically $1.8 trillion, is false. The initial cost estimate for the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) was around $900 billion over 10 years, not $1.8 trillion. The $1.8 trillion figure is often cited in the context of the total cost of the healthcare system in the United States, not just the Affordable Care Act.

Without specific details or evidence, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The $6,000 figure is not based on any official or reliable source. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which provided tax cuts for the wealthy, did not result in a $6,000 annual cost for middle-class families. The actual impact of the tax cuts on middle-class families varies and is not as straightforward as the claim suggests.

"Explanation: The claim that the Texas leg of the Keystone pipeline has created 4,800 jobs in just the year it has been up and running is not accurate. The Keystone XL pipeline, which includes the Texas leg, was completed in November 2022, and it is not accurate to attribute 4,800 jobs to just the year it has been operational. The pipeline's construction phase created many jobs, but the operational phase does not typically create as many jobs. Additionally, the claim does not specify the source of the information, which is a red flag for credibility.

The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of NATO's activities.

While agricultural work can be dangerous and children are often involved in these activities, especially in developing countries, the number of child deaths in agriculture is not higher than in other industries.

While the ACA did introduce several new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes are not the largest in U.S. history. For example, the Revenue Act of 1913, which established the modern income tax system, and the Revenue Act of 1940, which introduced the payroll tax, were larger tax increases. Therefore, the claim is false.

Therefore, it's not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

"Explanation: The claim that an annual income of $500,000 in Manhattan is considered middle class is false. In Manhattan, the median household income is around $100,000, and the average household income is around $150,000. Therefore, an income of $500,000 would be considered high income or upper class, not middle class.

Obama's stance on the debt ceiling and his criticism of President Bush's economic policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) did not find that the stimulus bill would lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2019.

"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Hosni Mubarak were all authoritarian leaders who suppressed independent unions, the claim that they ""didn't want unions"" is an oversimplification. Hitler, for instance, initially supported the German Labor Front (DAF) as a means to control the German workforce, but later suppressed it. Stalin also initially supported unions but later suppressed them as part of his broader campaign to control all aspects of society. Mubarak, similarly, initially allowed some unions but later suppressed them as part of his authoritarian rule. Therefore, the claim that they ""didn't want unions"" is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not establish a new board of federal bureaucrats to dictate health plans.

The claim is a misrepresentation of the ACA's provisions.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Kansas has elected Democrats to the U.S. Senate in recent history. For example, Pat Roberts, a Republican, was elected in 1996 and served until 2015. However, the claim suggests that no Democrat has been elected since before ""The Wizard of Oz"" hit the movie theaters in 1939, which is not accurate. The last Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from Kansas was Jerry Moran, who was elected in 2010.

The claim that the opinion was unsigned and that it was a ""sneaky"" move is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Without specific data to support this claim, it is difficult to determine its veracity.

"Explanation: Systems development charges (SDCs) are fees levied by local governments to fund the costs of new infrastructure and services required to support new development. While it is true that SDCs are primarily intended for capital investments, such as roads, water and sewer lines, and other public infrastructure, the specific use of these funds can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the local government's policies. Some jurisdictions may allow for a portion of SDCs to be used for operational expenses or other purposes, but this is typically subject to specific regulations and oversight.

"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney and Bain Capital are to blame for a woman's premature death due to the closure of the plant where her husband worked is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that Bain Capital, under Romney's leadership, closed several plants, including the one where the woman's husband worked, it is not accurate to attribute the woman's death directly to this closure. The claim lacks specific evidence linking the plant closure to the woman's death and does not consider other potential contributing factors to her health condition. Therefore, the claim is not supported by sufficient evidence.

"Explanation: The 2013 immigration bill, also known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did not specifically address Syrian refugees or their resettlement. The bill focused on border security, legalization of undocumented immigrants, and other immigration-related issues. The resettlement of Syrian refugees was a separate issue that began to gain attention after the Syrian civil war escalated in 2011. The U.S. government's ability to bring Syrian refugees to the country was governed by the Refugee Act of 1980, which established the process for admitting refugees, including background checks. Therefore, the claim that the 2013 immigration bill expanded President Obama's ability to bring Syrian refugees without mandating meaningful background checks is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts is not accurate.

"Explanation: As of the latest data available, Latinos do not make up the majority population in Texas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2020, the largest ethnic group in Texas is White (42.4%), followed by Hispanic or Latino (39.8%), and then Black or African American (12.8%). Therefore, the claim that Latinos now make up the majority population in Texas is false.

"Explanation: The claim is false. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker did propose a law that would provide a two-year tax exemption for businesses that move into the state, but this law was not passed.

"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the wealthiest counties in the United States are not concentrated in and around the Washington, D.C. area. The top 10 wealthiest counties by median income are spread across various states, including California, New York, and Texas. For example, the wealthiest county in the U.S. is Loudoun County, Virginia, which is near Washington, D.C., but the other top counties are not in the same area.

"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not promise to cut the deficit by half by the end of his first term. Instead, he promised to reduce the deficit by half over the next decade.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama carried Congressional District 13 by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012 is false. The 2008 election results for Congressional District 13 show that Obama won by a margin of 10.5 points, not 8.2. In 2012, he won by a margin of 11.3 points, not 5.6. These figures can be verified through official election results from the Federal Election Commission or other reputable sources.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend"" is a misinterpretation of the national debt. The national debt refers to the total amount of money that the U.S. government owes to its creditors. When the government spends more money than it collects in taxes, it borrows money to cover the difference. However, this does not mean that every dollar spent is borrowed. The claim is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the promise Delta Air Lines made to the person or the people of Memphis.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The wealthiest counties in the United States are typically measured by median household income, not by the number of counties in a specific area. The Washington, D.C., area is indeed home to some of the wealthiest counties in the country, but it is not accurate to say that seven of the top ten wealthiest counties are in this area. The top ten wealthiest counties in the U.S. are often found in states like California, New York, and Texas, and the specific counties can vary depending on the source and the year of the data.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Refugees undergo a more rigorous screening process than the average tourist in the U.S. This is due to the fact that refugees are subject to a more extensive vetting process, including interviews, background checks, and security screenings, to ensure they do not pose a threat to national security.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: While water transportation is indeed one of the most fuel-efficient and least polluting means of moving cargo, it is not necessarily the safest or least expensive. Safety can vary depending on the type of waterway and the specific conditions of the voyage. Additionally, water transportation can be expensive due to factors such as port fees, vessel maintenance, and the need for specialized equipment. Therefore, the claim that water transportation is the ""safest"" and ""least expensive"" is not accurate.

"Explanation: The claim states that ""about 7 in 10 of Oregon's inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses."" To verify this, I would need to check the latest statistics from a reliable source such as the Oregon Department of Corrections or the Bureau of Justice Statistics. However, based on general trends and available data, it is known that a significant portion of inmates in the United States are incarcerated for violent crimes and serious sex offenses. Without specific data for Oregon, it is difficult to confirm the exact percentage, but it is plausible that a substantial number of inmates in Oregon fall into these categories.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Fair Tax will be like waving a magic wand releasing us from pain and unfairness is hyperbolic and misleading. The Fair Tax, also known as the FairTax Act, is a proposed tax reform that would replace the current income tax system with a national sales tax. While proponents argue that it could simplify the tax code and reduce the tax burden on lower-income individuals, it also has significant drawbacks, such as potentially increasing the tax burden on lower-income individuals due to the regressive nature of a sales tax, and it does not address all forms of economic inequality or unfairness. Therefore, the claim that it will release us from all pain and unfairness is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Governor Carcieri has not been campaigning with the speaker. Without specific context or evidence, it is difficult to verify the truth of this claim.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago. This claim is false because it is not typical for a legislator to oppose a vote on their own legislation. If a legislator introduces a bill, they typically support it and advocate for its passage. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the legislative process.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Crist sent his 'top policy staffer to the House Committee to testify in support of the proposal,' then vetoed the bill"" implies that Crist initially supported the proposal but later changed his mind.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by facts.

"Explanation: In the United States, the practice of checking the immigration status of individuals during routine traffic stops or other arrests is a contentious issue. While some states have laws that allow police officers to check immigration status, others have laws that prohibit such checks. The specific rights of police officers in this regard can vary significantly depending on the state and the context of the arrest. Therefore, the claim that ""Police officers in this state have that right, to check the immigration status of people they arrest"" is not universally true and depends on the specific state and its laws.

Additionally, the claim that the person created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man, woman, and child in America is not supported by any credible sources. The U.S. government has been working on smallpox vaccine distribution and production, but there is no evidence to support the claim that an individual created enough vaccine to vaccinate the entire population.

This claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The Democratic proposal for a government-controlled health care plan, often referred to as Medicare for All, does not aim to deprive Americans of their current health care coverage.

The proposal does not target or aim to eliminate existing private health insurance plans. The claim of depriving 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage is a misrepresentation of the proposal.

"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is responsible for the roughly $7,800 in property taxes per year is false. Property taxes are levied by local governments, including cities, counties, and school districts, to fund public services. The mayor of a city has some influence over the budget and tax rates, but they are not directly responsible for the amount of property taxes an individual pays. The tax rate and the amount of property taxes paid are determined by the city council and other local governing bodies, not the mayor.

"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is not identified as Houston's mayor. Without specific information about who made the claim and their role in Houston's job growth, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
"Explanation: The claim that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters knew that they were planning to take over the country and attack it is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. The FBI investigation into the San Bernardino shooting did not find any evidence that the shooters had plans to take over the country or attack it. The neighbors of the shooters did not report any such plans to the authorities.

"Explanation: According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the leading cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin is suicide, followed by unintentional injuries (which include drug overdoses). While opioid-related deaths are a significant public health issue, they are not the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Texas Supreme Court's website, the majority of justices have prior judicial experience. As of 2021, out of the 150 justices who have served on the Texas Supreme Court, only a small fraction had no prior judicial experience. The claim exaggerates the number of justices with no prior experience.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the incidents of threats against President Barack Obama are greater than for any other president in modern times is not accurate. While President Obama did face several threats and assassination attempts during his presidency, the number of threats he faced is not unprecedented compared to other modern presidents. For instance, President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt, and President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Therefore, the claim that Obama faced more threats than any other modern president is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific proposal by President Obama in 2011, which was a spending freeze for non-defense discretionary spending. This freeze was intended to reduce the growth of the federal budget, but it did not affect the overall spending levels for the period from 2011 to 2020. The claim that the spending freeze would only reduce the $42 trillion in government spending by little more than one-half of 1 percent is accurate because the spending freeze was a temporary measure that did not significantly impact the overall spending trend over the decade.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day is highly unlikely. The process of creating and implementing new laws typically involves a lengthy process that includes legislative proposals, committee reviews, debates, and approvals. It is not feasible for 40,000 new laws to be enacted in a single day. This claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinformation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: At the beginning of World War II, the United Kingdom had a significantly larger army than Portugal. The UK had a standing army of around 200,000 troops, while Portugal had a much smaller army, with estimates ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 troops. Therefore, the claim that the UK had a relatively small army, smaller than Portugal's, is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""Were within 600 miles of 60 percent of America."" This is a geographical claim that can be evaluated by looking at the population distribution and the distances involved. The United States has a population of approximately 331 million people. If we consider 60 percent of the population, that would be around 200 million people. If we assume a uniform distribution, 600 miles would cover a significant portion of the country, but it's not accurate to say that 60 percent of the population is within 600 miles of a specific location. The claim is vague and does not provide specific data or context to support the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about state budget cuts resulting in nearly 4,000 educator layoffs is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess the truth of this claim, I would need specific data or sources that confirm the number of educator layoffs and the direct correlation to state budget cuts. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific gun bill before the Senate that is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners. The most recent significant gun legislation, such as the Bipartisan Gun Violence Prevention Act of 2023, has focused on measures like background checks, red flag laws, and other provisions aimed at reducing gun violence, but not universal registration of firearms.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the U.S. added 431,000 jobs in February 2021, making it the top job creator for that month. However, the claim that the U.S. is now the No. 4 job creator in the last year is incorrect. The U.S. has been the top job creator in the last year, with a total of 10.6 million jobs added from March 2020 to February 2021.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has recovered more than $60 million that was lost to Medicaid fraud is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim ""This is a test of the fact-checking widget"" is a statement about the purpose of the current interaction, which is to test the functionality of a fact-checking widget. Since the purpose of the statement is to inform about the test, it is not a claim about a factual event or statement that can be verified as true or false. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a true or false claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets and resulted in a decrease in murder and violent crime rates for eight consecutive years is misleading. The bill in question is the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, not Joe Biden. The act did not add 100,000 cops but rather provided funding for local law enforcement agencies. Additionally, while there was a decrease in violent crime rates in the 1990s, it is not accurate to attribute this solely to the Biden Crime Bill. Multiple factors, including changes in policing strategies, demographic shifts, and economic conditions, contributed to the decline in crime rates.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA) did make some changes to Medicare, it did not cut Medicare benefits for seniors. The ACA actually expanded Medicare benefits for seniors by providing preventive care services without cost-sharing and closing the Medicare Part D ""doughnut hole."" The claim that only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors is incorrect because other presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, have made changes to Medicare that could be seen as cuts or reductions in benefits.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that having a baby is a leading cause of poverty in the United States is not accurate. While it is true that having children can increase the financial burden on a family, it is not the leading cause of poverty. Poverty in the United States is primarily driven by factors such as lack of education, unemployment, underemployment, and systemic issues like racial and gender-based wage gaps, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate social safety nets. Having a baby can exacerbate existing financial struggles, but it is not the primary cause of poverty.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that you have to get a license to fish on our beaches is generally false. In many places, including the United States, you do not need a license to fish from the shore. However, there are some exceptions and regulations that may apply, such as size limits, daily bag limits, and specific gear restrictions. It's always a good idea to check local regulations or contact a local fishing authority for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Minnesota has had Republicans in control of at least one part of the government for most of the time since 2007, with the exception of 2007-2008 and 2011-2012. Wisconsin, on the other hand, had Democrats controlling both legislative chambers and the governorship from 2011 to 2017.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island voters are moving away from the Democratic party to non-affiliation is based on a trend observed in recent elections. According to the latest data from the Rhode Island Secretary of State's office, there has been a significant increase in the number of unaffiliated voters in the state. This trend suggests that a portion of voters who previously identified as Democrats are now choosing to register as unaffiliated. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that all Democrats are leaving the party; rather, it indicates a shift in voter registration patterns.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of elections and the number of incumbents defeated can vary greatly depending on the specific states and years in question. The claim does not provide specific details about the states or years involved, making it impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim that only three incumbents have been defeated in 420 elections is highly unlikely and suggests a lack of understanding of the typical outcomes of state legislative elections.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that President Obama doubled the deficit is misleading. While it is true that the U.S. federal deficit increased significantly during Obama's presidency, it is not accurate to say that he doubled it. The deficit increased from $1.08 trillion in 2008 to $1.4 trillion in 2012, which is an increase of about 30%, not a doubling. Additionally, the deficit was largely driven by the economic crisis and the subsequent stimulus packages, not solely by Obama's policies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that John McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan is false. John McCain, a Republican, was a strong advocate for a surge of troops in Afghanistan during his time as a senator and was critical of President Obama's withdrawal strategy. There is no evidence to suggest that McCain has changed his position on this issue.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that most serial killers and people who commit domestic violence start off by abusing animals is not supported by empirical evidence. While there are some cases where individuals who abuse animals also go on to commit other forms of violence, this is not a universal pattern. The correlation between animal abuse and other forms of violence is not strong enough to make the claim that ""most"" of these individuals start off by abusing animals.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland supported giving $150 billion to the Iranian regime is false. Ted Strickland, a former governor of Ohio, has not been involved in any policy decisions regarding the Iranian regime or any financial support for it. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his political stance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) is a proposed law that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The claim that the DREAM Act would grant lower tuition to undocumented immigrants is a misinterpretation of the act. The DREAM Act does not specifically address tuition rates, and it does not provide lower tuition rates to undocumented immigrants. The claim is a distortion of the facts surrounding the DREAM Act.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about possibly raising the Social Security retirement age is true. The Social Security Administration has been discussing and considering changes to the retirement age due to the increasing life expectancy and the need to ensure the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. This is a topic of ongoing debate and discussion in the United States.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican-authored state budget in question does not include a provision forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance. The claim is a misinterpretation of the budget's provisions, which primarily focus on expanding access to health insurance through the marketplace and potentially increasing the number of people eligible for subsidies.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the bipartisan task force or its existence. Without concrete information or a reliable source, it is impossible to verify the claim's authenticity.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. While there has been significant construction of new oil and gas pipelines in recent years, the claim that the total length of these pipelines is enough to circle the Earth and then some is an exaggeration. The Earth's circumference is approximately 40,075 kilometers (24,901 miles). The total length of new pipelines constructed in the past three years is not enough to exceed this distance.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is about the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and its benchmarks. The GAO is a federal agency that provides independent, objective analysis to Congress and the public. The claim states that three out of 18 benchmarks have been fulfilled, which implies a failure. However, the claim does not provide specific details about which benchmarks were fulfilled or what the criteria for success are. Without specific details, it is difficult to verify the claim's accuracy. Additionally, the claim mentions ""Republican math,"" which suggests a political bias, but this does not affect the factuality of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. President Barack Obama did indeed make statements about ISIS (or ISIL) being contained, specifically in the context of its geographic expansion in Iraq and Syria. For instance, in a 2015 press conference, he stated, ""We have contained ISIL's expansion in Iraq and Syria."" This statement was made in response to the situation on the ground at that time, indicating that the containment was a specific response to the geographic spread of ISIS in those regions.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim states that ""earmarks have come down significantly, 75 percent."" However, without specific context or data to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Earmarks are typically government funds allocated for specific projects or programs, and their reduction could be due to various reasons such as budget cuts, policy changes, or shifts in government priorities. To accurately evaluate this claim, one would need to refer to official government reports, budget documents, or other reliable sources that provide specific data on the reduction of earmarks.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 2010 was the worst year ever for America's doctors reimbursed by Medicare is not accurate. While 2010 did see a significant reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates, it was not the worst year ever. In fact, the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, which was used to determine reimbursement rates, led to a 21.4% reduction in 2010. However, this was not the largest reduction in history. The largest reduction occurred in 2003, when the SGR formula led to a 4.4% reduction. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""regulations have quadrupled"" under a specific president is not accurate. According to the Mercatus Center's study, the number of new regulations issued by the federal government has not quadrupled. The study found that the number of new regulations issued by the federal government has increased by about 10% under this president, which is not a quadrupling.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are advisers within Obama's campaign who are anti-Israel. While it is true that some individuals associated with Obama's campaign have expressed views critical of Israeli policies, it is not accurate to label them as ""anti-Israel"" in a blanket statement. The claim is an oversimplification and lacks nuance. It is important to note that political views are complex and cannot be reduced to a single label.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. During the Great Recession of 2008, corporate profits indeed declined significantly. However, by 2010, two years after the recession, corporate profits began to recover and eventually surpassed pre-recession levels. This recovery was driven by various factors, including increased productivity, cost-cutting measures, and a recovering economy.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The president did not propose eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers. In fact, the proposed tax reform in 2017, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, did not eliminate charitable deductions but rather increased the standard deduction, which could reduce the number of people who itemize their deductions, including charitable donations.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: Mitt Romney has been the subject of numerous claims about his financial dealings, including allegations of having millions in the Cayman Islands. However, these claims have been widely debunked. Romney has publicly disclosed his tax returns, which show that he has not hidden millions in offshore accounts. The claim that he had millions in the Cayman Islands is a misrepresentation of his financial situation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""There is already a mosque four blocks away"" cannot be verified without specific context or additional information.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay is not accurate. While eBay is a significant platform for many people to sell items and make money, the number of people who make their primary living off eBay is much lower. According to various studies and reports, the number of people who rely on eBay for their primary income is in the tens of thousands, not millions.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Northern Virginia is the most heavily trafficked place in the country is not accurate. While Northern Virginia, particularly the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, does experience heavy traffic due to its proximity to the nation's capital and major highways, it is not the most heavily trafficked place in the country. That distinction typically goes to areas with high population densities and major transportation hubs, such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan's proposal, known as the ""Ryan Budget,"" did not limit Medicare spending to $15,000 per person. Instead, it proposed converting Medicare into a premium support system, where beneficiaries would receive a fixed amount of money to purchase private health insurance plans. The $15,000 figure is a misinterpretation of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim about 25 million to 30 million people being allowed to access a national health insurance exchange is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been in effect since 2014 and has provided health insurance to millions of Americans through the Health Insurance Marketplace. However, the claim of a specific number of people being allowed to access the exchange is not accurate and does not reflect the reality of the ACA's implementation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim states that Oregon has had unemployment higher than the national average for 17 years. To verify this, I would need to check historical unemployment data for Oregon and the United States. However, without specific data points, it's challenging to confirm the claim. Typically, unemployment rates fluctuate over time, and it's possible for a state to have higher unemployment than the national average for extended periods. Therefore, without concrete data, it's difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
"Explanation: John McCain has not proposed to keep the estate tax at 0 percent. In fact, he has previously supported the repeal of the estate tax, but his stance on this issue has evolved over time.

"Explanation: The claim that Rick Scott has teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist is a complex one. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified evidence to support this specific claim. The claim is not substantiated by credible news sources or official records. Therefore, it is likely to be a false or unfounded claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""there is not one Democrat who endorses the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan"" is false. While it is true that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan, which proposed to replace Medicare with a voucher system, was not widely endorsed by Democrats, there were some Democrats who expressed support for certain aspects of the plan or were open to negotiations. For instance, some Democrats, such as Senator Joe Lieberman, were open to discussing a voucher system as part of a broader healthcare reform package. Therefore, the claim that ""there is not one Democrat who endorses the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan"" is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that the United States death rate is two-and-a-half times higher for those who do not have a high school education is based on a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study found that individuals without a high school diploma had a mortality rate that was approximately 2.5 times higher than those with a high school diploma or higher. This indicates that the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about a specific area (McAllen) and its constituents. To verify this claim, one would need to refer to reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Census Bureau, or local health department reports. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that Switzerland and the Netherlands cover all their citizens using private insurers and do so for much less cost is misleading. Both countries have universal healthcare systems, but they differ in their approach to funding and delivery. In Switzerland, the healthcare system is primarily funded through a mix of public and private insurance, with the government setting minimum coverage requirements. The Netherlands also has a universal healthcare system, but it is funded through a combination of public and private insurance, with the government regulating the market to ensure affordability and accessibility. While these systems may have lower costs compared to some other countries, they are not entirely private insurers covering all citizens.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ExxonMobil made $19 billion in profit last year and paid zero in taxes, receiving a $156 million refund from the IRS, is false. While it is true that ExxonMobil has reported significant profits, the claim about paying zero taxes and receiving a refund is misleading. Corporations can receive tax refunds if they overpay their taxes, but this does not mean they paid zero in taxes. The claim is likely an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the company's tax situation.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is acting without consultation or input from the company to stop the sale of Buckyballs. However, the CPSC typically follows a process that includes consultation with manufacturers and other stakeholders before taking regulatory actions. The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that the CPSC is acting without consultation. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is true. Many states in the United States have been cutting back on funding for public television. For example, in 2021, several states such as California, Texas, and Florida reduced their funding for public broadcasting. This trend is not unique to a single state but is a broader phenomenon affecting multiple states.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the United States has one of the highest vaccination rates among developed countries. However, some African countries have also achieved high vaccination rates, particularly in the context of COVID-19. For example, countries like Rwanda and Seychelles have had high vaccination rates due to their effective public health strategies and international support. Therefore, while it is true that some African countries have higher vaccination rates than others, it is not accurate to say that all African countries have higher rates than the United States.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim ""On support for the Bridge to Nowhere"" is ambiguous and does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. The term ""Bridge to Nowhere"" is often used to describe a project that is not needed or is a waste of resources, but without additional context, it's impossible to say whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""For decades, the states gas tax has been among the highest in the nation"" is not accurate. While some states do have high gas taxes, it is not accurate to say that this has been the case for decades. Gas tax rates vary by state and can change over time. For example, in 2021, California had the highest gas tax rate in the nation, but other states have had higher rates in the past. Therefore, the claim is not true.

Answer: 0"

"Explanation: The claim that small businesses are going out of business in record numbers is not accurate. While it is true that many small businesses have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall trend is not as severe as the claim suggests. According to various reports and studies, while there has been an increase in business closures, the rate is not unprecedented and is not at record levels. The Small Business Administration (SBA) and other sources have reported that while many businesses have closed, the overall number of closures is not at an all-time high.

"Explanation: The claim is true. Some members of the House of Representatives have received farm subsidies, and there have been instances where these same members have proposed cuts to food stamps.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The weight of turkeys has indeed increased over time due to selective breeding and improved feeding practices. However, the specific weights provided in the claim are not accurate. According to the National Turkey Federation, the average weight of a turkey in the United States in 2020 was around 16 pounds, which is significantly higher than the 13.2 pounds claimed for the 1930s. The 29.8 pounds claimed for today's turkeys is also not accurate, as the average weight of a turkey in 2020 was around 16 pounds.

"Explanation: The claim is false. The $60 billion approved by Congress in response to Hurricane Sandy was not solely for disaster relief. The funds were allocated to various purposes, including infrastructure repair, housing assistance, and economic recovery. The 10 percent figure is misleading as it suggests that only 10 percent of the funds were used for disaster relief, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The President has indeed taken executive actions on immigration, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for certain countries. However, these actions have been challenged in court, and the President has not claimed that he did not have the constitutional power to take them. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the President's statements and actions.

"Explanation: The claim about public financing of his campaign is not specific enough to be evaluated as true or false. It could refer to various candidates and campaigns, and without additional context, it's impossible to determine the veracity of the claim.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is generally true. The U.S. tax system is progressive, meaning that higher-income individuals typically pay a higher effective tax rate than lower-income individuals. The top 1% of earners in the U.S. often pay an effective tax rate of around 20-30%, while the middle class, which typically falls into the 15% and 25% income tax brackets, also faces payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes) that can add up to around 7.65% of their income. Therefore, the claim that the mega-rich pay about 15 percent in taxes while the middle class is hit with heavy payroll taxes is accurate.

Answer: 1"
"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's estimate of a $3.6 billion state budget deficit is manufactured and a bogus figure is false. The Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, an independent state agency, has confirmed that the state faces a budget deficit of $3.6 billion for the 2021-2023 biennium. This figure is based on the state's revenue projections and spending plans, and it is not a manufactured or bogus figure.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that children born today will carry a $30,000 share of the national debt is false. The national debt is a collective responsibility of the country, and it is not accurately divided among individuals based on their birth year.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are both regulatory agencies in the United States, but they have different jurisdictions. The USDA primarily regulates meat, poultry, and egg products, while the FDA regulates most other foods, including sandwiches. The number of slices of bread in a sandwich does not change the regulatory agency responsible for it. Both a sandwich on one slice of bread and a sandwich on two slices of bread would fall under the FDA's jurisdiction.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that ""Among Syrian refugees, there aren't that many women, there aren't that many children"" is false. According to various reports and studies, the Syrian refugee population is composed of a significant number of women and children.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The Buffett Rule, proposed by Warren Buffett, is a tax policy that would impose a minimum tax rate on individuals with very high incomes. The claim that the Buffett Rule would bring in less than $5 billion per year is false. The Buffett Rule is designed to ensure that high-income individuals pay a minimum tax rate, and estimates suggest that it could generate significant revenue. For example, a 2012 analysis by the Congressional Research Service estimated that the Buffett Rule could generate around $50 billion in revenue annually. Therefore, the claim that it would bring in less than $5 billion per year is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
"Explanation: The claim that one-third of the healthcare dollar goes to insurance companies is a misinterpretation of the actual distribution of healthcare costs. The claim is often used to argue against the high cost of healthcare insurance, but it is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in 2019, about 34% of healthcare spending was for private health insurance, not one-third. The remaining 66% was for Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs, as well as out-of-pocket spending by patients. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
