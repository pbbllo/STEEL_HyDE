1,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible evidence or legislation that suggests health care reform will mandate free sex change surgeries. While some health care reform discussions may include provisions for gender-affirming care, these are typically focused on providing necessary medical treatments and not on mandating specific procedures. The claim is misleading and not supported by current legislation or policy discussions.

Answer: 0"
2,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two unrelated entities: the number of starting quarterbacks for the Chicago Bears in the last 10 years and the number of tenured faculty fired at the University of Wisconsin (UW) in the last two decades. These two numbers cannot be directly compared as they are from different contexts and do not have a logical relationship. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
3,"Explanation: During Mitt Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, the state's budget did indeed decrease in size. However, it's important to note that this was primarily due to a decrease in spending on social services and education, rather than a broad-based reduction in government size. Additionally, the state's budget was also influenced by federal stimulus funds during the recession. Therefore, while there was a reduction in government spending, it is not accurate to say that the rate of growth of the government was slowed or that it was cut overall.

Answer: 0"
4,"Explanation: The claim is false. John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was known for his strong support of free trade and opposed protectionist measures. He was a co-sponsor of the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2015, which gave the president the power to negotiate trade agreements. He also supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. There is no evidence to suggest that he opposed a requirement for the government to buy American-made motorcycles or that he called all buy-American provisions ""disgraceful.""

Answer: 0"
5,"Explanation: The claim states that both women and men are making less when adjusted for inflation compared to when John Kitzhaber was first elected governor. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical data on wages and inflation rates. However, without specific data points or a clear reference to the time period in question, it is challenging to verify the claim. Typically, wage adjustments for inflation are calculated using indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). If the claim is based on a specific study or data set, it would need to be referenced to confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without additional data.)"

7,"Explanation: The claim states that an ISIS supporter tweeted at 10:34 a.m. and shooting began at 10:45 a.m. in Chattanooga, Tenn. However, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that an ISIS supporter tweeted at 10:34 a.m. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific details about the shooting incident or the identity of the shooter. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true based on the information provided.

The Obama administration did implement policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, such as the Clean Power Plan, but these policies did not aim to completely eliminate coal use. Instead, they aimed to reduce emissions by encouraging the use of cleaner energy sources and improving efficiency. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
10,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has the authority to regulate toilet seats is false. The U.S. federal government does not have the authority to regulate toilet seats. This is a matter that falls under the purview of state and local governments, not the federal government. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of regulations related to public health and safety, which are more broadly applicable to public restrooms and not specifically to toilet seats.

Answer: 0"
11,"Explanation: The claim that Austin has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded is not accurate. While Austin has experienced significant growth over the years, the rate of doubling every 25 years is an exaggeration. Austin's population growth has been steady but not exponential. For instance, in the 1970s, Austin's population was around 300,000, and by the 2000s, it had grown to around 700,000, which is a significant increase but not a doubling every 25 years.

Answer: 0"

The actual number of nuclear tests conducted worldwide is much higher, with estimates ranging from 2,000 to 2,500 tests. Additionally, the claim that the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of the total nuclear tests is also false. The United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China have conducted a significant portion of nuclear tests, but the exact percentage is not 99.99%.

14,"Explanation: The claim that a U.S. Supreme Court justice suggested that some U.S. cases will be decided based on South African law is false. The U.S. Supreme Court operates under the U.S. Constitution and federal laws, and it does not consider foreign laws, including South African law, in its decision-making process. The U.S. legal system is distinct and independent from foreign legal systems.

Answer: 0"
15,"Explanation: The claim is false. The term ""terrorist attack"" is commonly used by government officials, including the Director of Homeland Security, to describe incidents where individuals or groups use violence or threats of violence to achieve political, religious, or ideological goals. The term ""man-made disaster"" is not typically used to describe such incidents. The Director of Homeland Security, like other government officials, would use the term ""terrorist attack"" to describe such events.

Answer: 0"
16,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission's ideas is false. While it is true that the commission's recommendations were not fully implemented, Obama did take some actions based on the commission's findings. For instance, he signed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which was partially based on the commission's recommendations. Therefore, the claim that he took ""exactly none"" of the ideas is an oversimplification and is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
18,"Explanation: Terry McAuliffe is a prominent American politician who served as the Governor of Virginia from 2018 to 2022. However, there is no evidence or historical record that suggests he invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom. The Lincoln Bedroom is a historic room in the White House, and its use for renting out has been a practice that has been in place for many years, predating McAuliffe's political career.

Answer: 0"
19,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the New York State Governor Kathy Hochul in a press release. According to the press release, New York State added 800,000 private sector jobs in 2021, which is a significant increase. The unemployment rate in New York State has been decreasing, and as of the latest data, it is indeed lower than it was before the pandemic. However, the claim that New York State has more private sector jobs than it has ever had in its history is not explicitly stated in the press release. The press release only mentions that the state added 800,000 jobs in 2021, which is a record for the state, but it does not compare this to all-time historical data.

Answer: 1"
20,"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama, who served as the 44th President of the United States, did not run for re-election in 2016. Therefore, he did not have a campaign to announce his cabinet choices. The claim seems to be a mix-up with the 2008 presidential election, where he was elected as the President.

Elena Kagan, who served as the Solicitor General of the United States from 2009 to 2013 and later as a Supreme Court Justice from 2010 to 2022, did not take a position on military recruiters at Harvard. The claim about the Supreme Court ruling unanimously that she was wrong is also incorrect. There is no record of such a case or ruling.

Answer: 0"
23,"Explanation: Mayor Jorge Elorza, not Mayor Cicilline, was the mayor of Providence during the period when the city was designated as a sanctuary city. Mayor Elorza signed an executive order in 2014 that made Providence a sanctuary city, which means the city limits its cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Therefore, the claim that Mayor Cicilline was responsible for Providence being a sanctuary city is false.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misinformation.

26,"Explanation: The claim that Virginia has been net zero on job creation since Bob McDonnell became governor in 2010 is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Virginia has seen a net increase in employment since 2010. For example, in 2010, Virginia had approximately 3.5 million jobs, and by 2021, that number had grown to over 4.2 million jobs. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
27,"Explanation: The claim is false. The savings rate in the United States during the recession was not 6.2 percent. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the personal savings rate in the U.S. was around 13.6 percent in the first quarter of 2020, which was a significant increase from the pre-pandemic levels. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual data.

Answer: 0"
28,"Explanation: The claim is asking about a general practice or expectation regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominees during confirmation hearings. It is a general principle that nominees are expected to be forthcoming and answer questions honestly during their confirmation hearings.

Answer: 1"
29,"Explanation: Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor and U.S. Representative, has been known to support various healthcare policies, but there is no specific evidence or statement from him that directly supports cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. Medicare Advantage is a popular program that provides additional benefits to Medicare recipients, and any cuts to this program would likely be opposed by many of Crist's supporters.

Answer: 0"
30,"Explanation: Scott Brown, a former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, did not co-sponsor any legislation that would allow employers to deny women coverage for birth control. In fact, he was a co-sponsor of the Affordable Care Act, which includes provisions for contraceptive coverage. The claim is a misrepresentation of his political record.

Answer: 0"
31,"Explanation: While Egypt has made some progress in political and democratic reforms in the past 20 years, such as the 2011 revolution and the subsequent constitutional amendments, the overall political environment remains highly authoritarian. The government has been criticized for suppressing political opposition, restricting freedom of speech, and limiting civil liberties. Therefore, the claim that Egypt has made ""great strides"" in political and democratic reform is an overstatement.

Answer: 0"
32,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the attention paid to Chris Christie this week with the coverage of the Benghazi incident. As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have specific data on the exact amount of attention paid to Chris Christie this week or the coverage of the Benghazi incident. However, the claim suggests a comparison in significance, which is subjective and depends on the context and the source of the information. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
33,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland voted to keep the shutdown going is false. Rep. Southerland is a Republican from Florida and has been vocal about his opposition to the shutdown. He voted against the continuing resolution that would have kept the shutdown going, not for it.

Answer: 0"
34,"Explanation: The claim that Austin is burdened by the fastest-growing tax increases of any major city in the nation is not accurate.

The claim lacks specific data or sources to support the assertion that Austin has the highest tax increase rate among major cities.

Answer: 0"
35,"Explanation: The claim that Phoenix, Arizona, is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world is not accurate. While Phoenix does have a high rate of kidnappings compared to other cities in the United States, it is not the second highest in the world. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program does not rank cities globally based on kidnappings. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to support the statement.

Answer: 0"
36,"Explanation: The AFL-CIO (American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations) is a federation of labor unions in the United States.

Answer: 0"
37,"Explanation: The claim that US population growth is at its lowest since the Great Depression is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population growth rate in the United States has been declining in recent years, but it is not at its lowest since the Great Depression. The Great Depression period (1929-1939) saw a significant decline in population growth due to the economic crisis and the Dust Bowl, but the current population growth rate is still higher than that period.

Answer: 0"
38,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of deaths from gunfire in the United States since 1968 to the total number of deaths in all of the country's wars throughout its history. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been approximately 1.5 million gun-related deaths in the U.S. since 1968. In contrast, the total number of deaths in all U.S. wars is significantly lower. For example, the Vietnam War alone resulted in approximately 58,000 deaths. Therefore, the claim that more Americans have died from gunfire since 1968 than in all of the country's wars is true.

Answer: 1"
39,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' website, FreshFromFlorida.com, is primarily focused on providing information about Florida's agriculture, food, and consumer services. It does not offer permits for carrying a loaded hidden gun. Permits for concealed weapons in Florida are issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' Division of Licensing, but the process involves an in-person application and background check, not an online application.

Answer: 0"
40,"Explanation: The claim that NATO is opening up a major terror division is false. NATO has not announced any such division, and there is no credible source supporting this claim.

Answer: 0"
41,"Explanation: Sen. Barack Obama, who later became President Obama, has indeed been consistently rated as pro-choice by organizations such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. However, the claim that he has always had a ""100 percent pro-choice rating"" is a simplification. While he has consistently supported abortion rights, his stance has evolved over time, and he has not always been in favor of all aspects of abortion rights. For example, he has supported restrictions on late-term abortions. Therefore, the claim that he has always had a ""100 percent pro-choice rating"" is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
42,"Explanation: The claim that the federal debt is growing by more than $4 billion a day is not accurate. The U.S. federal debt is indeed increasing, but the daily increase is not consistently more than $4 billion. The debt increases due to various factors, including government spending and revenue collection, but the daily increase can vary significantly. For instance, in 2021, the U.S. federal debt increased by an average of about $3.5 billion per day, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's data.

Answer: 0"

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
44,"Explanation: The claim that the economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999 is based on the assumption that the current job growth rate is higher than the rate in 1999. However, without specific data or context, it is not possible to verify this claim. To accurately assess the claim, one would need to compare the current job growth rate with the rate in 1999 using reliable economic data sources.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
45,"Explanation: The claim states that about half of the presidents have been governors and half of them have been senators. This claim is not accurate.

49,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. Supreme Court found that Social Security is not guaranteed is false. The Social Security Act of 1935 established a system of old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits, which are guaranteed to eligible individuals. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of Social Security, including in the landmark case of *Helvering v. Davis* (1937), which affirmed the program's constitutionality. Therefore, the claim that the Supreme Court found Social Security is not guaranteed is incorrect.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that he intends to bring terrorists to Colorado.

Answer: 0"
51,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Oregonians have a no-cost way to fight abortion through free political donations.

Additionally, political donations do not directly influence abortion laws or policies. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
52,"Explanation: The claim that Mr. Caprio has never worked in the private sector is false. Mr. Caprio, whose full name is Robert Caprio, is a former politician who served as a member of the New York State Assembly. However, he has also worked in the private sector.

There is no evidence to suggest that he attempted to expand third-trimester abortions.

Answer: 0"
57,"Explanation: The claim that ""half our general revenue goes to education"" is not accurate. The percentage of general revenue allocated to education varies by country and can be influenced by various factors such as the specific government's budget priorities, economic conditions, and the overall tax revenue. For example, in the United States, education spending is a significant portion of the federal budget, but it is not exactly half. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in 2020, the federal government spent about 10% of its budget on education, while state and local governments spent a larger portion. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"

64,"Explanation: The claim that judges get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state is a generalization and may not be accurate for all judges or all states. Judges' benefits, including salary, retirement plans, and other perks, are typically determined by state laws and regulations. While it is possible that some judges may receive better benefits, it is not accurate to say that all judges get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state. The claim lacks specific evidence and context to support its assertion.

Answer: 0"
65,"Explanation: The claim that ""there are a lot of casinos across the country that have gone bankrupt"" is not accurate. While it is true that some casinos have closed or filed for bankruptcy, the number is not as high as the claim suggests. The casino industry has been resilient, and many casinos have adapted to changes in the market, such as the legalization of online gambling and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
66,"Explanation: The claim that small businesses create 70 percent of the jobs in America is often cited but is not entirely accurate. While small businesses do contribute significantly to job creation, the exact percentage varies depending on the source and the definition of ""small business."" According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses (defined as those with fewer than 500 employees) account for about 64% of new job creation in the U.S. However, this figure is not 70%. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
67,"Explanation: The claim that there are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined is false.

It is managed by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and is funded by private donations and grants.

The government shutdown only affected federal agencies and programs that are funded by the federal government, not voluntary programs like Amber Alert.

70,"Explanation: The Cash for Clunkers program, which was a U.S. government program that ran from July 2009 to August 2009, did offer incentives for trading in older vehicles for new, more fuel-efficient ones. However, the claim that you can simply tow an old car to your house and receive $4,500 is inaccurate. The program required that the old vehicle be traded in for a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle, and the $4,500 was a voucher that could be used towards the purchase of the new vehicle, not a direct payment for the old vehicle.

Answer: 0"
71,"Explanation: The claim that ""Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real"" is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. While it is true that some Republicans have been skeptical about the extent and urgency of climate change, there are also many Republicans who acknowledge that climate change is real and support action to address it. For example, former Republican Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger has been a vocal advocate for climate action. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
72,"Explanation: The claim that 28,000 people have been killed along the U.S.-Mexico border in the last five years is not accurate. According to the U.S. Border Patrol, the number of deaths along the border has been around 5,000 to 6,000 per year, with the majority of deaths occurring due to natural causes, accidents, or medical issues. The claim of 28,000 deaths is an exaggeration and not supported by reliable data.

Answer: 0"
73,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was implemented to increase access to affordable health insurance. While it is true that some people may have lost their insurance due to changes in the law, the overall goal of the ACA was to expand coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsured rate in the U.S. dropped from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2019, indicating that millions more people gained access to insurance. Therefore, the claim that the law denies millions access to affordable insurance is false.

Answer: 0"
74,"Explanation: The claim that close to 30% of the federal prison population consists of illegal immigrants is not accurate. According to the most recent data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 4.7% of the federal prison population is composed of immigrants who are not U.S. citizens. This percentage includes both those who are in the country illegally and those who are lawful permanent residents or have other immigration statuses. Therefore, the claim significantly overstates the proportion of illegal immigrants in the federal prison population.

78,"Explanation: The claim that former Gov. Tom Kean had the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history is false. In the 1985 election, Tom Kean defeated Jim Florio with a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%, which was indeed a significant margin. However, the claim that this was the largest margin in Jersey history is incorrect. In 1993, Jim Florio defeated Christine Todd Whitman with a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%, which is the same margin as Tom Kean's victory in 1985. Therefore, neither of these elections had the largest margin in Jersey history.

79,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare is the biggest tax increase in American history is not accurate. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did introduce several new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes were not the largest tax increase in American history.

Therefore, the claim is false.

The claim that he ""wanted to partition Iraq"" is also false. Biden has consistently supported a unified Iraq and has not advocated for its partition. The claim that he ""opposed the surge"" is partially true, as Biden did not support the troop surge in Iraq, but he did not oppose the initial deployment of troops.

Answer: 0"
92,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has faced numerous legal challenges, but the claim that twelve judges have thrown out legal challenges because they rejected the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional is inaccurate. The Supreme Court, in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, and the lower courts have generally followed this ruling. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the legal process surrounding the ACA.

Terry McAuliffe, the former Governor of Virginia, has not proposed a tax increase of $1,700 for all residents.

Answer: 0"
102,"Explanation: The claim that college tuition has gone up four times the rate of inflation since 1978 is generally accurate. According to data from the College Board, the cost of tuition and fees at public institutions has increased by about 1,041% since 1978, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation, has increased by about 250% over the same period.

105,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific calculation that assumes all $47 billion would be directly used to create jobs in infrastructure. However, this is a simplified model and does not account for various factors such as the efficiency of job creation, the cost of materials, labor, and other overheads, as well as the potential for job displacement in other sectors. Additionally, the claim does not specify the duration of the job creation period, which could affect the total number of jobs created.

The claim about 47 million people needing government help to feed themselves and 15 million families owing more than the value of their home are also not supported by recent data.

127,"Explanation: The claim is based on a 2019 report by the Brookings Institution, which estimated the GDP of Black America to be around $1.3 trillion. However, this figure is not a direct comparison to the GDP of a country, but rather an estimate of the economic activity within the Black American community. Additionally, the ranking of countries by GDP is not a static figure and can change based on various economic factors. Therefore, the claim that Black America would be the 15th wealthiest nation in the world is not accurate.

Answer: 1"
148,"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme is false. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading.

While President Trump did propose tax increases during his presidency, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced corporate and individual tax rates, he did not propose the largest tax increase in American history.

Answer: 0"
151,"Explanation: The claim that earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget is false. Earmarks, which are provisions in legislation that direct funds to specific projects or programs, have been significantly reduced in recent years. In 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 eliminated earmarks for the federal budget, and the amount of money allocated through earmarks has been declining since then. Therefore, the claim that earmarks account for $18-billion of our budget is inaccurate.

While there are some Republicans who have proposed changes to these programs, such as raising the retirement age for Social Security or reducing benefits, there is no widespread or official Republican stance in Texas or nationally that advocates for the complete abolition of these programs. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
159,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Bush administration did not write a check to General Motors without any conditions of change. In fact, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) provided funds to General Motors and Chrysler in 2008, but these funds came with conditions, including the requirement for the companies to restructure and reduce their debt. The government also received equity in both companies as part of the deal.

Answer: 0"
160,"Explanation: The claim is false. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama's campaign did not refuse to disclose donors. In fact, he was the first presidential candidate to release his donors' names online. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the transparency efforts of the Obama campaign.

Answer: 0"
161,"Explanation: The claim that Oregon is the only state in the USA that continues to pay 100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families is false. While Oregon does offer comprehensive health benefits to its employees, it is not the only state to do so. Many other states, such as Hawaii, Massachusetts, and New York, also provide similar benefits to their employees and their families.

Answer: 0"
162,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rand Paul has not been seen as much in recent times due to various reasons, including his focus on his Senate campaign and his health issues. However, he has not been ""shopping for a billionaire"" to fund his super PAC. Super PACs are independent political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose political candidates. They are not required to have a billionaire as a donor. The claim is a mischaracterization of the political process and Rand Paul's activities.

Answer: 0"
163,"Explanation: The claim about the Mitchell Park Domes losing about $1 million-plus every year and the number of people going to the Domes has been going down is based on a general statement and does not provide specific sources or data to support it. Without concrete evidence or official reports, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
164,"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, employers have the right to terminate an employee's employment without going to court. The process typically involves providing notice, following any contractual or legal requirements, and ensuring that the termination is not discriminatory or illegal. There is no requirement for employers to go to court to fire an employee.

Answer: 0"
165,"Explanation: The claim that there is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used is not entirely accurate. While some studies have suggested that red light cameras may not significantly reduce accidents, other studies have shown that they can lead to a decrease in accidents and violations. The effectiveness of red light cameras can vary depending on the specific intersection and the implementation of the system. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
166,"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 29,000 Oregonians, which is approximately 5% of all homeowners, are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage. This claim is based on a specific statistic from a reliable source, such as a government report or a reputable news outlet. Without additional context or verification, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
167,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Hate Crimes bill, also known as the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, does not target religious leaders for their sermons about sexual practices. The bill is designed to enhance penalties for hate crimes, which are crimes motivated by bias against a person's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. It does not criminalize religious teachings or moral traditions.

Answer: 0"
168,"Explanation: The claim states that state school funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation. To verify this claim, we would need to look at specific data on state school funding per pupil from 2009 and the present year, adjusted for inflation. Without access to this data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on reliable sources and accurate data, it would be true.

Answer: 1"
169,"Explanation: In 2013, the number of people receiving welfare benefits in the United States was indeed higher than the number of people working. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2013, there were approximately 47.7 million people receiving some form of government assistance, while the number of people employed was around 155.5 million. Therefore, the claim that there were more people on welfare than working in 2013 is true.

Answer: 1"
170,"Explanation: The claim that State Rep. Kristi Thibaut was an ACORN lobbyist is false. ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) was a community organizing group that was active in the United States from 1970 to 2010. There is no evidence to suggest that Kristi Thibaut was a lobbyist for ACORN. The claim appears to be a misinformation or a false accusation.

Answer: 0"
171,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Oregon Health Plan (OHP) does not cover abortions. In Oregon, abortions are not considered medically necessary and are not covered by the OHP. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
172,"Explanation: The claim suggests that any legislative action taken now could be nullified by a decision of the Supreme Court expected this June. This is a speculative statement and does not provide specific details about the legislative actions or the Supreme Court's expected decision. The Supreme Court's decisions can indeed impact legislation, but the claim is too vague to be considered true or false without more context.

Answer: 0"
173,"Explanation: The claim is a political statement and does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that New York City is not getting its fair share of money. It is a general statement that could be interpreted differently depending on the context and the specific policies being discussed. Without concrete evidence or data, it is difficult to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
174,"Explanation: According to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, Texas has the highest percentage of residents without health insurance among all states. This data is based on the American Community Survey and is widely accepted as accurate.

Answer: 1"
175,"Explanation: The claim that the current administration and Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control is not accurate. In fact, the Trump administration, which was in power from 2017 to 2021, requested and received significant funding for border security, including the construction of the border wall. The Biden administration has also requested and received funding for border security, although the specifics of how that funding is allocated and used have been a subject of debate and criticism. Therefore, the claim that funding has been systematically cut is misleading.

Answer: 0"
176,"Explanation: Mitt Romney released his tax returns during his 2012 presidential campaign. He released two years of tax returns in 2012, and in 2016, he released his tax returns for the previous two years. Therefore, the claim that he is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns is false.

Answer: 0"
177,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 data, New Hampshire has the lowest property tax rate in the country. Therefore, the claim that New Hampshire has the third-highest property tax in the country is false.

Answer: 0"
178,"Explanation: The claim that Obama's tax plan cuts taxes ""for 95 percent of all working families"" is a simplification and an exaggeration. While the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Obama, did include tax cuts for many Americans, it is not accurate to say that 95 percent of all working families benefited from these cuts. The tax cuts were targeted at lower- and middle-income individuals and families, but the percentage of beneficiaries was not as high as 95 percent.

Answer: 0"
179,"Explanation: The claim that 59 percent of Americans believe Barack Obama is still a Muslim is false. According to various polls and surveys, the majority of Americans do not believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim. For instance, a 2016 poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found that only 11% of Americans believe that Obama is a Muslim. Therefore, the claim that 59 percent of Americans hold this belief is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
180,"Explanation: The claim that Carol Shea-Porter wants to increase taxes on small businesses and job creators is a political statement that can be interpreted differently based on the context and specific policies she has proposed. Without specific details or a clear source, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim. However, if the claim is based on general political rhetoric or specific policy proposals, it would need to be evaluated within that context.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific context or source.)"
181,"Explanation: The claim is false. A bill delaying the start of classes until Labor Day would not necessarily shave 5 full weeks off the school year. The actual number of weeks shaved would depend on the specific dates of Labor Day and the current start date of the school year. Additionally, the claim assumes that the school year would end on the same date as it would have without the delay, which is not necessarily the case.

Answer: 0"
182,"Explanation: The claim about whether the United States should intervene in Libya is a political and strategic question that does not have a definitive true or false answer. It depends on the perspective and the criteria used to evaluate the intervention. For instance, some might argue that intervention is necessary to prevent humanitarian crises or to support democratic movements, while others might argue that it is not in the U.S.'s best interest to intervene due to potential risks, costs, and the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false in an absolute sense.

Answer: 0"
183,"Explanation: The claim is false. Gallup does not conduct polls in Egypt, and there is no evidence to support the claim that 70 percent of Egyptians do not want U.S. money. Gallup is an American polling organization that primarily conducts surveys in the United States and other countries, but not Egypt.

Answer: 0"
184,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statistic from the FBI's crime statistics, which is a reliable source. However, without specific data or context, it's difficult to verify the exact percentage reduction in violent crime during a particular administration. The claim could be true if the data supports it, but it requires further verification.

Answer: 0/1"
185,"Explanation: Scott Maddox has indeed run for several political offices in Florida, including for the Florida Senate and the Florida House of Representatives. However, the claim that he has run ""losing campaigns for 3 of Florida's 4 available cabinet positions"" is misleading. Cabinet positions in Florida are not elected positions but are appointed by the Governor. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Scott Maddox has run for these positions.

Answer: 0"
186,"Explanation: The claim that Americans spend 6.1 billion hours a year on tax preparation is false. According to the IRS, Americans spend an average of 13.5 hours per year on tax preparation. This figure is significantly lower than the claimed 6.1 billion hours.

Answer: 0"
187,"Explanation: The claim that the United States is now energy independent for the first time ever is not accurate. While the U.S. has made significant strides in reducing its dependence on foreign energy sources, it is not entirely energy independent. The U.S. still imports and exports energy, and its energy independence is more about reducing dependence on specific sources rather than being completely self-sufficient. The term ""energy independence"" is often used to describe a situation where a country produces enough energy to meet its own needs without relying on imports from other countries.

Answer: 0"
188,"Explanation: The claim that Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour last year is false. This figure is not accurate and does not reflect the company's actual earnings. Exxon's annual earnings are significantly lower than the claimed hourly figure. For instance, in 2021, Exxon's net income was approximately $19.4 billion, which translates to about $53 million per day or $2.2 million per hour, not $4.7 million per hour.

Answer: 0"
189,"Explanation: The claim states that Republican Sen. John McCain won more votes in Cuyahoga County in the 2008 general election than he did in seven states. This claim is false because it is not possible for McCain to have won more votes in a single county than in seven states. The total number of votes in a county is typically much smaller than the total number of votes in seven states combined.

Answer: 0"
190,"Explanation: The claim states that Peter Kilmartin voted in favor of expanding the good behavior statute to sex offenders. However, there is no specific information provided to verify this claim. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
191,"Explanation: The claim that Occupy Atlanta protesters were allowed to stay in Woodruff Park is false. The Occupy Atlanta movement, which began in 2011, was not permitted to camp in Woodruff Park. The city of Atlanta had restrictions on camping in public parks, and the protesters were eventually removed from the park.

Answer: 0"
192,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of African American men currently in the U.S. criminal justice system (prison, jail, probation, or parole) to the number of enslaved African Americans in 1850. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, as of 2019, there were approximately 2.2 million African American men in the U.S. criminal justice system. In 1850, the U.S. Census reported approximately 3.9 million enslaved African Americans. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
193,"Explanation: The claim that limiting labor negotiations to only wages is how it is for the most part in the private sector is not entirely accurate. While wages are certainly a significant part of labor negotiations, private sector negotiations often also include other aspects such as benefits, working conditions, job security, and other perks. These negotiations can be quite comprehensive and are not limited solely to wages.

Answer: 0"
194,"Explanation: The claim is false. Del Valle, a neighborhood in Austin, Texas, has several grocery stores within its vicinity. The closest grocery stores to Del Valle are located in the area itself, such as H-E-B and Walmart, which are both within a short driving distance. Therefore, residents of Del Valle do not need to drive to Bastrop to access the closest grocery store.

Answer: 0"
195,"Explanation: The claim that Mark Warner voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt is false. Mark Warner has been a consistent advocate for fiscal responsibility and has voted against many of the tax increases and debt increases proposed by the Democratic Party. He has also been critical of excessive government spending and has voted against many of the spending bills proposed by the Democratic Party. Therefore, the claim that he voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt is inaccurate and misleading.

Answer: 0"
196,"Explanation: The claim that a United Nations arms treaty would almost certainly force the U.S. to create an international gun registry and set the stage for full-scale gun confiscation is false. The United Nations has no authority to force the U.S. to create an international gun registry or confiscate guns. The U.S. is not a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), and the treaty does not require any country to create a gun registry or confiscate guns. The ATT is a voluntary agreement that aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, and it does not impose any obligations on non-signatory countries like the U.S.

Answer: 0"
197,"Explanation: The claim that there was ""virtually no international pressure on Iran"" when a certain administration took office is a subjective statement and can be difficult to verify without specific context. However, it is generally accepted that there has been significant international pressure on Iran, particularly regarding its nuclear program and human rights issues. This pressure has been exerted through various means, including economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and international resolutions.

Answer: 0"
198,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the actions taken against the big oil companies. Without concrete evidence or specific examples, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
199,"Explanation: The claim that abortion doctors are flying into a state, performing abortions, and flying out is a common misconception. Abortion services are typically provided by local healthcare providers, and the claim suggests a scenario that is not typical or legal. Abortion doctors are usually part of local healthcare systems and do not travel between states for the purpose of performing abortions.

Answer: 0"
200,"Explanation: The claim that Maurice Ferre says Kendrick Meek has voted 98.6 percent of the time with the Democrat party is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific source or evidence to support this claim. It is possible that Maurice Ferre made such a statement, but without a reliable source or context, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
201,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is dead last in income growth among midwestern states during Gov. Scott Walker's term is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Wisconsin's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was higher than several other midwestern states during Walker's tenure as governor. For example, in 2015, Wisconsin's GDP growth rate was 2.5%, which was higher than states like Illinois (1.8%) and Michigan (1.6%). Therefore, the claim that Wisconsin is dead last in income growth is false.

Answer: 0"
202,"Explanation: The claim about a three-cents-per-ounce soda tax in Philadelphia resulting in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry is based on a study conducted by the Center for Local Government Finance and Policy. The study estimated that a soda tax could lead to job losses in the beverage industry, including those held by Teamsters. However, the specific number of 2,000 jobs is not universally accepted and is subject to debate. The impact of a soda tax on jobs can vary depending on factors such as the size of the tax, the economic conditions in the region, and the response of the beverage industry.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or not definitively true based on the available information.)"
203,"Explanation: The claim ""On repeal of Wisconsin's smoking ban"" is incomplete and lacks specific details about the repeal of the smoking ban. Without additional context or information about the repeal, it is impossible to determine if the claim is true or false. Therefore, the claim cannot be evaluated as either true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
204,"Explanation: The claim is true. John Hagee, a prominent American evangelist, has made controversial statements about Hurricane Katrina and the Catholic Church. In 2005, he stated that Hurricane Katrina was a punishment from God for the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts. He also has criticized the Catholic Church, calling it ""the Antichrist"" and a ""false cult."" These statements were widely reported in the media and are well-documented.

Answer: 1"
205,"Explanation: The claim that 51 percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax is based on a misinterpretation of data. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reports that about 44% of tax filers do not owe any federal income tax because they have no taxable income or their tax credits and deductions exceed their tax liability. However, this does not mean that 51% of filers paid zero tax; it means that 51% of tax filers had no taxable income or their tax credits and deductions covered their tax liability.

Answer: 0"
206,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin has been losing jobs at rates not seen in decades since Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took office is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been relatively stable and has not shown a significant increase since Walker took office in 2011. In fact, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been lower than the national average for much of Walker's tenure. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
207,"Explanation: The claim is false. The last Republican senator from New Jersey was Tom Kean, who served from 1982 to 1989. Since then, no Republican has been elected to the Senate from New Jersey. The claim that you would be the first Republican senator elected in New Jersey in 41 years is incorrect because there have been no Republican senators from New Jersey since 1989.

Answer: 0"
208,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Wisconsin's Attorney General and State Treasurer ordered the daughter of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson to not discuss climate change on state time. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of facts.

Answer: 0"
209,"Explanation: The claim that unions take away hard-earned money from teachers, firefighters, and police officers to play politics is a generalization and often a misrepresentation of the role of unions. Unions primarily exist to negotiate better wages, benefits, and working conditions for their members. The dues collected from members are used to fund these negotiations, legal battles, and other services provided to the members. The idea that these funds are used solely for political purposes is a common misconception. While unions may contribute to political campaigns, this is typically done through separate political action committees (PACs) and is not a primary use of member dues.

Answer: 0"
210,"Explanation: President George W. Bush did indeed conduct interviews with the New York Times during his presidency. For instance, he granted an interview to the New York Times in 2004, which was published on October 10, 2004. Therefore, the claim that he never did one interview with the New York Times during his entire presidency is false.

Answer: 0"
211,"Explanation: The claim that Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign and therefore has no donors is false. Donald Trump has received significant donations from various individuals and organizations throughout his political career. While he has contributed a portion of his own funds to his campaigns, he has also relied on donations from supporters to finance his campaigns.

Answer: 0"
212,"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 2,000 high schools, which is approximately 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States, produce about half of the nation's dropouts. This claim is false because it is not possible for a specific number of schools to produce half of the nation's dropouts. The number of dropouts is distributed across a much larger number of schools, and the claim does not provide any evidence or data to support this specific percentage.

Answer: 0"
213,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Atlanta Housing Authority, which found that approximately 40% of Atlanta households spend more than 30% of their income on rent. This study was published in 2019 and is a reliable source of information. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
214,"Explanation: The claim that the Providence teacher contract is one of the longest in the country is not verifiable with the information provided. Teacher contracts can vary significantly in length and terms across different school districts and states. Without specific data or a comparison with other contracts, it is impossible to determine if the Providence teacher contract is indeed one of the longest in the country.

Answer: 0"
215,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the debt accumulated under the current president to the debt accumulated under all previous presidents combined. This is a complex comparison that requires specific data and context. Without specific data points or a clear definition of ""all those other presidents,"" it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. However, if we consider the total debt accumulated under the current president and compare it to the total debt accumulated under all previous presidents, the claim could be true or false depending on the specific data.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
216,"Explanation: The claim that annual precipitation has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century is not accurate. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average annual precipitation in Rhode Island has increased by about 4 inches over the last century. This increase is consistent with broader trends of increased precipitation in the northeastern United States, but it does not meet the threshold of over 12 inches as stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
217,"Explanation: The claim states that the state budget proposal has been submitted on time and that it is the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades. To verify this claim, I would need to check the official records or news sources to confirm the submission date and compare it with historical data on budget submissions by previous governors. Without this specific information, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information.)"
218,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV (Bureau of Motor Vehicles) is false. Ohio has a process in place to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV. The BMV is required to notify the county board of elections of any address changes, and the county board of elections is responsible for updating the voter registration records. This process ensures that voter registrations are kept up-to-date with the most current address information.

Answer: 0"
219,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the most commonly spoken languages in Texas, after English, are Spanish and Vietnamese. However, Vietnamese is not the third most commonly spoken language in Texas. The third most commonly spoken language is Spanish, followed by Vietnamese, and then other languages like Chinese, French, and German.

Answer: 0"
220,"Explanation: The claim is subjective and depends on personal opinion. The term ""most generous"" and ""good time bill"" are not quantifiable or universally defined. Therefore, it is impossible to objectively verify the claim as true or false without additional context or specific details about the bill in question.

Answer: 0"
221,"Explanation: The claim that the most likely triggering cause of microcephaly is the DTaP shot is false. The most widely accepted cause of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015-2016 was the Zika virus, which was transmitted by mosquitoes. The Zika virus infection during pregnancy has been linked to microcephaly in newborns. The DTaP vaccine is a different vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, and it is not associated with microcephaly. The Brazilian government's mandate for the DTaP vaccine was unrelated to the Zika virus outbreak.

Answer: 0"
222,"Explanation: The claim that ""Our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening)"" is a simplification and an exaggeration of the current job market situation. While it is true that the unemployment rate has been fluctuating and there are periods where the number of job seekers exceeds the number of job openings, the claim that there are three people looking for every job is not accurate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that as of the latest data, the ratio of job seekers to job openings is not as high as three to one. Therefore, the claim is an overstatement and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
223,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual reduced salaries and health benefits by about $10 million while serving as Dane County executive in Wisconsin. However, there is no specific source or evidence provided to verify this claim. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
224,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats have lost more than 900 state legislators since Barack Obama has been president is false. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of 2021, Democrats have lost a total of 30 state legislative seats since 2009, which is the year Barack Obama took office. This number is significantly less than 900.

Answer: 0"
225,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton's ""baby bond"" proposal, as outlined in her 2019 book ""What Happened,"" is a plan to provide a $5,000 trust fund for every child born in the United States. The claim incorrectly states that this would total $20 billion per year and then multiplies it by four years to reach $80 billion. The correct calculation would be $5,000 per child per year, which would indeed total $20 billion per year for 4 million births. However, the claim incorrectly multiplies this annual total by four years, which is not part of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
226,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island would be the first state in the nation to implement a hybrid retirement plan is not accurate. Hybrid retirement plans, which combine elements of defined benefit and defined contribution plans, have been implemented in various states and organizations across the United States. For example, the state of California has implemented a hybrid retirement plan for its employees. Therefore, the claim that Rhode Island would be the first state to do this is false.

Answer: 0"
227,"Explanation: The claim that the State Department reduced security in Libya before the Benghazi attacks is a matter of ongoing debate and has been the subject of multiple investigations and reports. The Accountability Review Board (ARB) report on the Benghazi attacks found that the State Department had requested additional security for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, but the requests were not always granted in a timely manner. However, the report also noted that the security situation in Libya was complex and that the U.S. government was working to improve security measures. The claim that security was actually reduced is not supported by the ARB report or other credible sources.

Answer: 0"
228,"Explanation: The claim is false. Failure to raise the debt limit does not directly force a U.S. default on debt payments. However, it can lead to a default if the government is unable to pay its bills, including interest on its debt. This is because the debt limit is the legal limit on how much debt the U.S. government can accumulate. If the debt limit is not raised, the government may not have enough money to pay its bills, including interest on its debt, which could lead to a default.

Answer: 0"
229,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats in the Legislature in 2009 voted for various pork projects including a $5 million scoreboard for the Milwaukee Bucks is false. The Milwaukee Bucks' new arena, which includes a $5 million scoreboard, was approved in 2019, not in 2009. The arena project was part of a broader agreement that included public funding, but the specific details of the scoreboard's funding were not part of the 2009 legislative session.

Answer: 0"
230,"Explanation: Turkey is not an Arab country. It is a country in Western Asia and Southeastern Europe, with a majority of its population being of Turkish ethnicity. While it has historical and cultural ties to the Arab world, it is not considered an Arab country. The term ""Arab"" typically refers to people who speak Arabic and share a common cultural heritage, and Turkey does not fit this definition.

Answer: 0"
231,"Explanation: The claim states that the number of people in Atlanta dying from HIV and AIDS declined by 59 percent between 2004 and 2012. This claim can be verified by checking reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or local health department reports. According to the CDC, the number of HIV/AIDS deaths in Atlanta has indeed decreased significantly over this period, with a notable decline in the number of new infections and AIDS-related deaths.

Answer: 1"
232,"Explanation: The claim that 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total number of jobs lost during the Great Recession, which occurred during Obama's first term, was approximately 8.8 million. The number of jobs lost by women was around 2.3 million, which is about 26% of the total jobs lost. Therefore, the claim that 92% of the jobs lost belonged to women is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
233,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican Party has not historically advocated for the elimination of the Department of Education. In fact, the Department of Education was established under the administration of Republican President Richard Nixon in 1979. The claim that the Department of Education was doubled in size under Republican leadership is also incorrect.

235,"Explanation: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has indeed called for an immediate federal monitor for the Newark Police Department. This was done in response to concerns about the department's use of force and racial profiling.

Therefore, the claim that the ACLU did not call for an investigation but instead called for an immediate federal monitor is true.

Answer: 0"
244,"Explanation: The claim that the No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work is a simplification of a complex issue. While job creation and economic recovery are indeed significant concerns for many Americans, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not accurate to say that this is the only or the most pressing issue for all Americans. Other important issues include healthcare, education, racial justice, climate change, and political polarization, among others. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
245,"Explanation: The claim that in 1944 we were in debt more than twice as much as we are now is false. In 1944, the U.S. national debt was approximately $280 billion, which was about 120% of the GDP. In 2021, the U.S. national debt was around $28 trillion, which was about 120% of the GDP.

Answer: 0"
246,"Explanation: The claim is about economic indicators and forecasts from private forecasters. Economic indicators are typically released by government agencies or reputable financial institutions, not private forecasters.

The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of existing laws or policies.

Answer: 0"
249,"Explanation: The claim that veterans disability claims backlog doubled in Obama's first term is false. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the backlog of disability claims was approximately 260,000 in 2009 when Obama took office. By 2012, the backlog had decreased to around 200,000. Therefore, the backlog did not double but rather decreased during Obama's first term.

252,"Explanation: The claim about abortion is a complex issue that involves legal, ethical, and medical aspects. The truthfulness of the claim depends on the specific statement being made. For example, if the claim is ""Abortion is illegal in all 50 states,"" this would be false because abortion laws vary by state in the United States. If the claim is ""Abortion is a safe medical procedure,"" this would be true as it is a common and safe procedure when performed by trained medical professionals. Without a specific claim to evaluate, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Answer: N/A (The claim is too vague to evaluate as true or false.)"
253,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of infant deaths following attempted abortions is not accurate. The Guttmacher Institute, a leading research and policy organization, reports that in 2010, there were 1,270 infant deaths due to complications from attempted abortions. However, this number is not specific to a single year but is an annual average over a period of time. The claim incorrectly states that this number is for a single year, which is misleading.

Answer: 0"
254,"Explanation: The claim that the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. for women under 50 is being killed by their spouse or domestic partner is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading cause of death for women under 50 in the U.S. is unintentional injuries, which include accidents, poisoning, and suicide. Domestic violence is a serious issue, but it is not the second leading cause of death for women under 50.

While it is true that many states have a significant number of craft breweries and home brewers, it is not possible to guarantee that every legislative district has at least one craft brewery. The distribution of breweries can vary greatly depending on factors such as population density, local regulations, and market demand. Additionally, the claim of ""countless home brewers"" is subjective and cannot be quantified accurately.

261,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island has the second-most heavily deployed National Guard in the United States is not accurate. According to the National Guard Bureau, the states with the highest National Guard deployments are typically those with large populations or significant military bases.

264,"Explanation: The claim that ""your taxes today are lower than when I took office"" is a subjective statement that depends on various factors such as the specific tax brackets, deductions, and credits that apply to the average middle-class family. Without specific data or context, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim. However, if we consider the general trend of tax policy changes over time, it is possible that tax rates have changed, but this would require detailed analysis of tax policies and their impacts on the average middle-class family.

270,"Explanation: The claim that veterans are being treated worse than illegal immigrants is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that veterans often face challenges in accessing healthcare and other services, it is not accurate to say that they are being treated worse than illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants may face different challenges, such as lack of legal status and access to certain services, but this does not necessarily mean they are receiving better treatment than veterans. The claim is misleading and oversimplifies the issues faced by both groups.

273,"Explanation: The claim that we spend twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation on Earth is not accurate. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health organizations, the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but it is not twice as much as any other nation. For example, in 2019, the U.S. spent approximately $10,966 per capita on healthcare, while countries like Switzerland and Germany spent around $5,000-$6,000 per capita. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
274,"Explanation: The Texas Education Agency (TEA) does not follow up to ensure that undocumented immigrants paying in-state tuition at Texas colleges are applying for permanent residency. The TEA's role is to oversee the state's public education system, including the administration of in-state tuition policies. However, the responsibility for immigration status and residency applications lies with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the individual immigrants themselves. There is no evidence to suggest that the TEA is involved in tracking or verifying the immigration status of students.

While it is true that the Democratic Party has won the popular vote in the last six presidential elections (2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), the claim that 18 states and the District of Columbia have voted Democratic in these elections is incorrect. The number of states that have voted Democratic in these elections is 20 (including the District of Columbia).

Answer: 0"
276,"Explanation: The claim that the healthcare.gov code contains language that waives users' reasonable right to privacy of their personal information is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are the primary laws governing the privacy and security of health information in the United States. These laws do not allow for the waiving of privacy rights, and any such language would be illegal and unenforceable. The code for healthcare.gov, like any other government website, is subject to these laws and regulations, and there is no evidence to suggest that it contains language that waives privacy rights.

These projects are part of the U.S. military's modernization efforts.

279,"Explanation: The claim that we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance annually is not accurate. According to the IRS, the total amount of money collected from taxes in the United States in 2020 was approximately $3.5 trillion. The cost of tax compliance, which includes the cost of tax preparation, tax collection, and tax enforcement, is a fraction of the total tax revenue. The military budget for the United States in 2020 was approximately $722 billion. Therefore, the claim that tax compliance costs are equal to the entire military budget is false.

Answer: 0"
280,"Explanation: The claim that exporters are using a federal loophole to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur to U.S. consumers is false. The U.S. has strict regulations regarding the importation of animal fur, including cat and dog fur. The Fur Products Labeling Act of 1950 requires that any fur product be labeled with the species of animal from which it is made. Additionally, the importation of dog fur is prohibited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Therefore, it is not possible for exporters to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur to U.S. consumers.

290,"Explanation: The claim that job growth in the United States is now at the fastest pace in the country's history is not accurate. While the U.S. has seen significant job growth in recent years, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not accurate to say that this is the fastest pace in the country's history. The fastest rate of job growth in the U.S. occurred in the late 1990s, with a peak of 3.2% in 1999. The most recent job growth rates have been around 2-3% per year, which is still strong but not unprecedented.

To verify this claim, we would need to check the budget requests made by the sheriff over the past 10 years.

If the claim is false, then there would be instances where the sheriff asked for budget increases that were higher than the inflation rate.

Answer: 1"
299,"Explanation: The claim that Ocean Spray is moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania largely because of costs associated with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is false. The RGGI is a cap-and-trade program that requires power plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it does not directly affect the costs of manufacturing facilities like Ocean Spray's. The company has cited other reasons for the move, such as the need for a larger facility to accommodate growth and the desire to be closer to its customers.

Answer: 0"
300,"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not run for the presidency in 2012; he ran in 2012. The year ""2012"" is already mentioned in the claim, so it should be ""in 2012"" instead of ""On running for the presidency in 2012.""

Answer: 0"
304,"Explanation: The claim is false. Congress has placed limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to use military force in the past. For example, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops abroad, and Congress can vote to end the deployment. Additionally, the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed after the 9/11 attacks has been used to justify military action against various groups, including the Islamic State. Therefore, the current debate over authorizing military action against the Islamic State is not the first time Congress has placed limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to use military force.

Answer: 0"
305,"Explanation: The claim is true. Marijuana has been cultivated and processed differently over time, leading to variations in potency and composition.

309,"Explanation: The claim that job growth always lags behind economic growth is not universally true. While it is often the case that job growth may not immediately match economic growth due to various factors such as structural changes in the economy, technological advancements, and shifts in industry, it is not accurate to say that job growth always lags behind economic growth. Economic growth can sometimes lead to job growth, especially in sectors that are expanding or experiencing technological advancements. Therefore, the claim is not universally applicable.

While there was significant opposition to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and immigration reform (amnesty) among some segments of the population, it is not accurate to say that the American people overwhelmingly rejected these policies. The 2014 midterm elections saw a mix of support and opposition to these issues, and the results were not a clear mandate against either policy. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that the American people overwhelmingly rejected these policies.

Answer: 0"
313,"Explanation: The claim is false. The approval ratings of Congress are not directly related to the re-election rates of incumbent lawmakers. Approval ratings reflect the public's opinion of Congress as a whole, while re-election rates are a measure of individual lawmakers' success in their campaigns. The approval ratings of Congress can be low due to various reasons, such as public dissatisfaction with specific policies or events, but this does not necessarily impact the re-election rates of individual members.

Answer: 0"
314,"Explanation: The claim states that the Governor did not consult members of his own party before releasing his transportation plan. Without specific information or evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. However, if the claim is based on a reliable source or official statement, it could be considered true. If the claim is based on speculation or a lack of evidence, it would be considered false.

Answer: 0/1 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
315,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio has lost more population than every other state in the country except for two is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Ohio's population has been declining since 2010, but it is not the state with the highest population loss. As of 2021, the states with the highest population losses are West Virginia, Illinois, and Michigan, with Ohio ranking 10th in terms of population loss.

Answer: 0"
316,"Explanation: The claim about ""On support for the auto bailouts"" is vague and does not provide specific details or context. To accurately evaluate the truthfulness of this claim, more information is needed, such as the source of the support, the specific auto companies involved, and the nature of the support (financial, political, etc.). Without this context, it is impossible to determine if the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
317,"Explanation: The claim that income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent is false. The highest marginal income tax rate during Eisenhower's presidency was 92% in 1953, but it was reduced to 91% in 1954 and 90% in 1955. However, these rates applied to the highest income brackets and were not representative of the overall tax rates for most Americans.

Answer: 0"
318,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the staffing ratio of officers to residents in Seattle to the current staffing ratio in the department in question. To verify this claim, we would need to know the specific staffing ratio in Seattle and the current staffing ratio in the department. Without this information, we cannot accurately determine if the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
319,"Explanation: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has specific policies regarding the use of medical marijuana. While VA doctors are not prohibited from discussing medical marijuana with veterans, they are not allowed to recommend or prescribe it. The VA's policy states that veterans should not use medical marijuana, and VA doctors are not authorized to recommend it. Therefore, the claim that VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana is true.

Answer: 1"
320,"Explanation: The claim states that the difference between her and Barack Obama in terms of experience is ""about 35 years."" This claim is false because it is not possible to accurately determine the exact difference in experience between two individuals without specific details about their careers and the time they have spent in their respective fields. The claim is vague and does not provide enough information to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
321,"Explanation: The claim that Tampa is the ""strip club capital of the world"" is not accurate. While Tampa does have a significant number of strip clubs, it is not accurate to label it as the ""capital"" of the world for this industry. This claim is often used in a humorous or hyperbolic manner, but it is not based on factual data or rankings.

Answer: 0"
322,"Explanation: Marquette University does not have a process for ""unsealing"" records. The university's records are typically sealed and can only be accessed under specific circumstances, such as a court order or a request from the student themselves. Therefore, the claim that someone ""unsealed their records at Marquette University"" is likely false.

Answer: 0"
323,"Explanation: U.S. Rep. Allen West is a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Florida's 18th congressional district from 2011 to 2013. He is not currently a member of Congress, and therefore, he is not a constituent of any current member of Congress. The claim that U.S. Rep. Allen West is a constituent of mine is false.

Answer: 0"
324,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. does not provide foreign aid to Cuba or Venezuela. In fact, the U.S. has imposed economic sanctions on both countries due to their political systems and human rights records. The U.S. does provide foreign aid to other countries, but not to Cuba or Venezuela.

Answer: 0"
325,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), does not provide Mexican citizens with stronger claims to Social Security benefits or protection against cuts compared to U.S. citizens. The agreement primarily focuses on trade and economic issues, not social security benefits. Mexican citizens would still be subject to the same rules and regulations regarding Social Security benefits as they are now, and there is no indication that they would have stronger claims or protection against cuts.

Answer: 0"
326,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in Florida refused to carry out the effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls"" is false. While there have been efforts to remove noncitizens from voter rolls in Florida, it is not accurate to say that all 67 supervisors of elections refused to participate. Some supervisors have cooperated with these efforts, while others have expressed concerns or refused to carry out certain aspects of the process. Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
327,"Explanation: The claim is comparing votes in two different states, Wisconsin and New York, for two different candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The claim is not comparing votes within the same state or for the same candidate. Therefore, it is not possible to directly compare the votes earned by Biden in Wisconsin with the votes earned by Trump in New York.

Answer: 0"
328,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Crist's veto clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in Florida is false. In 2021, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that prohibited the use of state funds for abortion services, including abortions performed in public hospitals. This bill was not affected by any veto from Governor Crist, who was not in office at the time. Therefore, the claim is misleading and incorrect.

Answer: 0"
329,"Explanation: The claim states that a specific individual condemned violence at a campaign stop in Arizona in March. Without specific details about the individual and the context of the campaign stop, it is not possible to verify the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
330,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Ohio House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, has not voted to change the process for drawing legislative boundaries to create objective criteria and modify the Constitution. The redistricting process in Ohio is currently controlled by the Republican-led legislature, and there is no evidence to suggest that they have voted to change the process to make it more objective or to take politics out of it.

Answer: 0"
331,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is responsible for over $14 trillion in debt is false. Debt accumulation is a result of the actions of the entire government, including the executive branch and Congress, and is not attributable to a single individual. Sen. Brown has been a member of Congress since 1993 and has served in various capacities, but the debt level is a cumulative figure that reflects the policies and actions of multiple administrations and Congresses over many years.

Answer: 0"
332,"Explanation: The claim that consumers save an average of $500 per car sold through franchised dealer model compared to direct sales by manufacturers is not universally accurate. The savings can vary greatly depending on the specific manufacturer, the model of the car, the location, and the individual dealership's pricing strategies. Additionally, direct sales by manufacturers often come with additional perks like lower overhead costs, which can sometimes offset the savings. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
333,"Explanation: The claim that 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance both before and after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is misleading. While it is true that Wisconsin had a high rate of insurance coverage before Obamacare, the claim that the rate remained unchanged after the implementation is inaccurate. The Affordable Care Act expanded access to health insurance, particularly for low-income individuals and families, which led to an increase in the number of people with health insurance coverage. Therefore, the claim that Obamacare had no impact on insurance coverage rates is false.

Answer: 0"
334,"Explanation: The claim about the Atlanta Streetcar creating 1,399 jobs is based on a study conducted by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) in 2014. The study estimated that the streetcar would create 1,399 jobs during its construction and operation. This study was widely reported in local media and has been cited as a basis for the claim. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
335,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is one of the bluest states and that under Scott Walker its unemployment rate is around 3.5% is partially true. Wisconsin is indeed considered a ""blue"" state, meaning it tends to vote Democratic. However, the unemployment rate under Scott Walker, who served as governor from 2011 to 2019, was not around 3.5%. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin during his tenure varied, but it was generally higher than 3.5%. For example, in 2015, the unemployment rate was around 5.5%, and in 2019, it was around 3.2%.

Answer: 0"

337,"Explanation: The highest paid employee of the State of Rhode Island is not a basketball coach. The highest paid employee is typically the governor or another high-ranking official, not a coach. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
338,"Explanation: The claim ""I don't have lobbyists running my campaign"" is a statement made by a candidate or political figure. The truthfulness of this claim depends on the specific context and the definition of ""lobbyists."" In political campaigns, ""lobbyists"" can refer to individuals or groups who advocate for or against specific policies or candidates. If the candidate is referring to professional lobbyists who are actively working on their behalf, then the claim would be false if such individuals are indeed involved. However, if the candidate is referring to informal supporters or volunteers, the claim could be true. Without specific information about the context and the definition of ""lobbyists,"" it is not possible to definitively judge the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
339,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that alcohol is illegal for individuals under 21 in many jurisdictions, this does not mean that underage alcohol use has increased. The claim seems to imply a contradiction, suggesting that underage alcohol use has increased despite the legal prohibition. This is not supported by evidence and is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
340,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to improve access to healthcare and reduce administrative burdens. It includes provisions to ensure that patients receive timely care, including access to necessary medical services like CAT scans. The claim that a bureaucrat would delay treatment under Obamacare is not supported by the actual provisions of the law, which aim to streamline and expedite healthcare services. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
341,"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true in many contexts, but not universally true.)"

Answer: 0/1"

Answer: 0"
345,"Explanation: The claim that Tammy Baldwin supports a law in which the government will take over your decisions on medicine, doctors, and hospitals is false. Tammy Baldwin, a Democratic Senator from Wisconsin, has been a strong advocate for healthcare reform, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare for All proposals. However, these proposals do not involve the government taking over individual decisions about medicine, doctors, and hospitals. Instead, they aim to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of her positions.

Answer: 0"
346,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) will cause Medicare to ""go away in less than 10 years"" is a misrepresentation of the facts. The Affordable Care Act was designed to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by reducing waste, fraud, and abuse, and by encouraging preventive care and wellness programs. The claim that Medicare will ""fall apart at the seams"" due to Obamacare is not supported by evidence or expert analysis. The Medicare Trustees' Report for 2021 projects that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted by 2026, but this is due to long-term trends in healthcare costs and demographics, not specifically due to the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
347,"Explanation: The claim is false. Sen. John McCain did not spend the July 4 weekend in Islamabad, Pakistan, selling F-16s and advanced weapons. McCain was a prominent figure in U.S. politics and was known for his involvement in foreign policy, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he was in Pakistan during that time or that he was involved in selling weapons to the Pakistani government. Additionally, the claim that Pakistan ""harbored Osama bin Laden"" is also false, as bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in 2011, and the U.S. military operation that led to his death was conducted in Abbottabad, Pakistan, not Islamabad.

Answer: 0"
348,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump ""doesn't make a thing in America"" is false. Donald Trump has been involved in various business ventures and has made significant contributions to the American economy. He has been a prominent figure in real estate, television, and politics.

Answer: 0"
349,"Explanation: The claim about Governor John Kasich spending 177 days out of state and using $350,000 in taxpayer money for his campaign is false.

Answer: 0"
350,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama's plan calls for ""mandates and fines for small businesses"" is false. During his presidency, Obama's administration implemented the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which included provisions for small businesses to provide health insurance to their employees. However, the ACA did not mandate that all small businesses provide health insurance, nor did it impose fines specifically for small businesses that did not comply with the law. The fines were primarily targeted at larger businesses that did not offer health insurance to their employees.

Answer: 0"
351,"Explanation: The claim states that the area near the proposed northern Wisconsin iron ore mine is 15 hours away from where the public hearing on mining was held. This claim is false because the distance between two locations is typically measured in miles or kilometers, not hours. The time it takes to travel between two locations depends on the mode of transportation and the speed at which it travels. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine the distance between two locations using hours as the unit of measurement.

Answer: 0"
352,"Explanation: The claim that ""Our credit rating went up since I've been in office"" is a subjective statement that depends on the specific context and the time frame in question. Credit ratings are influenced by various economic factors and policies, and it's not always clear whether a specific leader's actions directly led to an improvement in the credit rating. Therefore, without specific data or evidence, it's difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
353,"Explanation: The claim that African-American children are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids is an exaggeration. While it is true that African-American children are disproportionately affected by asthma, the mortality rate is not 500 percent higher. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), African-American children are about 2.5 times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma and 2.5 times more likely to die from asthma than white children. This is a significant disparity, but it is not 500 percent.

Answer: 0"
354,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of people killed by U.S. police in a single month to the number killed by U.K. police over a century. This is a misleading comparison because it does not account for the population size, the time period, or the context of each country's law enforcement practices. The U.S. has a much larger population and a higher rate of police interactions, which would naturally lead to a higher number of deaths. The U.K., on the other hand, has a smaller population and a different legal and cultural context. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
355,"Explanation: The claim that the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios is false. In fact, the Rhode Island General Assembly did debate and vote on the loan. The loan was approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly in 2010, with the state providing $75 million to the video game company 38 Studios. This information is well-documented in various news reports and official records.

The claim that 11 soccer players on the USMNT are immigrants is not accurate based on the information available up to that point.

357,"Explanation: The claim that China owns about 29 percent of the U.S. debt is true. As of 2021, China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, with holdings of approximately $1.07 trillion, which is about 29% of the total U.S. debt.

Answer: 1"
358,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2019, which estimated that Americans spend approximately 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax law. The study also estimated that the cost of compliance with tax laws annually is around $163 billion. These figures are derived from the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's annual report to Congress, which provides an analysis of the cost of compliance with the federal tax system.

Answer: 1"
359,"Explanation: The claim that Florida has the second-lowest campaign contribution limit in the entire country is false. According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Florida's campaign contribution limits are actually among the highest in the country. For example, in 2021, the contribution limit for federal candidates in Florida was $2,800 for primary elections and $2,800 for general elections, which is higher than many other states.

Answer: 0"
361,"Explanation: The claim that David Beckham's proposed soccer stadium at Miami's Port threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries is not supported by any credible sources. The economic impact of the stadium on the cargo and cruise industries has not been substantiated, and there is no evidence to suggest that the stadium would directly threaten the jobs and economic impact of these industries. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the potential effects of the stadium's development.

Answer: 0"
362,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies, specifically corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns and got $570 million in job-development incentives, is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that Scott Walker's administration provided job-development incentives to various businesses, including those that had contributed to his campaigns, the claim that $570 million was specifically given to his cronies is not supported by verifiable evidence. The amount of $570 million is not explicitly tied to his cronies or campaign contributors in any publicly available records or reports.

Answer: 0"
363,"Explanation: The claim that Burger King is pulling its franchises from military bases due to actions by President Barack Obama is false. There is no credible evidence or official statement from Burger King or any other source indicating that this decision was made as a result of actions taken by President Obama. In fact, Burger King has been operating franchises on military bases for many years, and there is no indication that this policy has changed.

Answer: 0"
364,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the United States has not engaged in a fourth conflict in a foreign land. The U.S. has been involved in conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, but there is no ongoing fourth conflict. Therefore, the claim is false.

Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
366,"Explanation: The claim that a 2005 gay pride vote had nothing to do with discrimination is false. The 2005 gay pride vote was a significant event in the history of LGBTQ+ rights, and it was directly related to discrimination. The vote was held in response to the passage of Proposition 8 in California, which banned same-sex marriage. The vote was a show of support for the LGBTQ+ community and a protest against the discrimination and inequality they faced.

Answer: 0"
367,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt increased $16,000 every second is an exaggeration. While the national debt does increase over time, the rate of increase is not constant and does not reach $16,000 per second. The claim is likely intended to be sensational and is not an accurate representation of the actual increase in the national debt.

Answer: 0"
368,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the current staff size of 51 with the staff size a decade ago. It does not provide specific numbers from a decade ago, so it is impossible to verify the claim without additional information.

Answer: 0/1"
369,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that detainees at Guantanamo Bay will receive the H1N1 vaccine.

370,"Explanation: The claim is asking about a specific political action (voting for a budget) by a specific individual (Rep. Paul Ryan). This type of claim is typically fact-based and can be verified through reliable sources such as news articles, official statements, or public records. Since the claim does not provide any specific context or source, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of the statement without additional information.

Answer: 0"
371,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy is false. The birther controversy, which questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama, began during his 2008 presidential campaign. While Hillary Clinton's campaign did not start the controversy, she did not actively promote it either. The birther movement was primarily led by conservative political figures and individuals who questioned Obama's eligibility to be president.

Answer: 0"
372,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about surveys conducted with Wisconsin employers. While it is possible that some employers have cited the anti-business litigation climate as a factor affecting their expansion decisions, it is not specific enough to be verified as true or false without additional context or data. Surveys can vary in their methodology, sample size, and interpretation, making it difficult to confirm the claim without more detailed information.

Answer: 0"
373,"Explanation: The claim that the Pasco County budget has doubled in the past three years is not accurate. According to the Pasco County's official budget reports, the budget has increased, but not by a factor of two. For example, the budget for the 2019-2020 fiscal year was approximately $1.2 billion, and the budget for the 2022-2023 fiscal year was approximately $1.4 billion. This represents an increase of about 16.7%, not a doubling.

Answer: 0"
375,"Explanation: The claim that there were no government benefits for immigrants when the grandfather arrived in the United States is false. While it is true that the current system of government benefits for immigrants is more extensive than it was in the past, there were indeed some forms of assistance available to immigrants in the early 20th century. For example, the Dillingham Commission, established in 1907, recommended that immigrants be provided with assistance in finding jobs and housing. Additionally, some states and cities offered assistance to immigrants through public works programs and other initiatives. Therefore, the claim that there were no government benefits for immigrants is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
376,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal aid for Medicaid expansion is not a tax that can be redirected to other states. Medicaid is a federal program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals and families. When a state chooses not to expand Medicaid, it does not send federal funds to other states. Instead, the federal funds remain with the state that chose not to expand Medicaid. The claim is a misinterpretation of how Medicaid funding works.

Answer: 0"
377,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""a third of all the young people in America are not in America today because of abortion"" is misleading and inaccurate. While it is true that one in three pregnancies in the United States end in abortion, this does not mean that one in three young people are not in America today due to abortion. The claim confuses the number of pregnancies that end in abortion with the number of young people who are not in America. The number of young people in America is not directly affected by the number of abortions.

Answer: 0"
378,"Explanation: Same-sex marriage is a legal recognition of a marriage between two people of the same sex. This practice has been legalized in many countries and is widely accepted in many societies. Therefore, the claim that same-sex marriage is a true statement.

380,"Explanation: The federal gas tax in the United States has indeed been raised since 1993. The current federal gas tax rate is 18.4 cents per gallon for regular gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel fuel, which was last increased in 1993. However, the claim that the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993 is false because it has been raised multiple times since then, including in 1993 itself.

Answer: 0"
381,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker's budget includes ""No weekend for workers"" is a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual policy. Scott Walker, a former governor of Wisconsin, implemented a policy that required state employees to work on Saturdays and Sundays, but this was not a complete elimination of weekends for workers. The policy was aimed at reducing the state's budget deficit and did not mean that all workers would have no weekend at all. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
382,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did not give control of Medicare patients' healthcare decisions to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats. The ACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was intended to make recommendations to Congress on how to reduce Medicare spending. However, the IPAB was never activated, and its powers were repealed in 2019. The claim misrepresents the role and existence of the IPAB.

Answer: 0"
383,"Explanation: The claim that under Hillary Clinton, State Department officials were sending official thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation is false. The Clinton Foundation is a private organization, and it is not appropriate for government officials to send official thank-yous to individuals for donations to a private foundation. This practice would be a violation of government ethics rules and could be seen as a conflict of interest.

Answer: 0"
384,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States is not the only nation that affords citizenship to anyone born within its borders, regardless of the legal status of their parents. Many countries, including Canada, Mexico, and several European nations, have similar policies.

Similarly, Mexico's constitution grants citizenship to anyone born in Mexico, regardless of their parents' immigration status.

Answer: 0"
387,"Explanation: The claim that in 41 states, government workers are better paid than the taxpayers who support them is not accurate. While it is true that government workers often have higher salaries and benefits compared to private sector workers, the claim that this is true in 41 states is an oversimplification and not supported by comprehensive data. The claim does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement, making it difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
388,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain said last year he didn't know of a solution to the mortgage crisis is false. John McCain, a former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate, has publicly discussed and proposed solutions to the mortgage crisis. He has advocated for various measures, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and other financial reforms. Therefore, the claim that he didn't know of a solution is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
389,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney said ""'No' to in-state tuition"" for illegal immigrants is false. Mitt Romney, during his 2012 presidential campaign, did propose a plan to deny in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, but he did not explicitly say ""'No' to in-state tuition"" in the way the claim suggests. The claim is a misrepresentation of Romney's stance.

Answer: 0"
390,"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, it is illegal to perform an abortion without the consent of the pregnant person. Additionally, administering medication to a child without permission is also illegal and unethical. The claim also suggests that it is acceptable to secretly take a child off for an abortion, which is not only illegal but also highly unethical and harmful.

Answer: 0"
391,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about a specific demographic group (single adults, ages 21 to 25 with no kids) and does not provide any specific data or source to support the claim. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time period or the geographical location, which could affect the validity of the statement.

Answer: 0"
392,"Explanation: The claim ""On torture"" is incomplete and lacks context. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false. Torture can refer to various forms of physical or psychological abuse, and its legality and prevalence depend on the specific context and jurisdiction.

Answer: 0"
393,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama plans to impose a tax of at least 23 percent on the Medicare prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries is false. There is no evidence or official statement from President Obama or his administration indicating such a plan. Medicare prescription drug benefits are funded through a combination of premiums, taxes, and government contributions, and any changes to these benefits would typically be announced and discussed in the context of broader healthcare reform initiatives.

Answer: 0"
394,"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario and does not provide any specific source or data to support it. President Obama's policies were in effect during the 2008-2016 period, and the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 4.7%. The claim does not provide any evidence or data to suggest that continuing with his policies would lead to a 9% unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the following year.

Answer: 0"
395,"Explanation: The claim is asking for an opinion on how the federal government should spend Florida's rejected high-speed rail money. This is a subjective and political question that does not have a definitive true or false answer. It is a matter of policy and personal belief rather than a factual statement that can be verified as true or false.

Answer: 0"
396,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Barack Obama has enacted a law that requires healthcare professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government for the purpose of gun confiscation. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law by President Obama, does not include such provisions. Additionally, the ACA does not give the government the authority to confiscate guns based on medical data.

Answer: 0"
397,"Explanation: As of the latest data, the population of Florida is indeed approximately 19 million people. The combined population of the earlier primary and caucus states (such as Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada) is significantly less than 19 million. Therefore, the claim that the population of Florida is larger than all the earlier primary and caucus states combined is true.

Answer: 1"
398,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct and arbitrary comparison between the cost of an ESD superintendent position and the cost of three speech pathologists, three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers. This comparison is not valid because the roles, responsibilities, and qualifications required for these positions are vastly different. The cost of each position is determined by various factors such as education, experience, and the specific needs of the role, not by a simple numerical ratio. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
399,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama Administration did not close 75 percent of the air traffic control towers in Republican Congressional Districts. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) closed 143 towers between 2013 and 2018, and only 40 of these were in Republican districts. This represents approximately 28 percent, not 75 percent.

Answer: 0"
400,"Explanation: The claim that Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954 is false. Crimea has a complex history, but it was not part of Ukraine until 1954. Before that, it was part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union. In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev, then the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, transferred Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR as part of a territorial reorganization within the Soviet Union. This transfer was not a gift or a gesture but a formal administrative decision.

Answer: 0"
401,"Explanation: The claim is true. A fiduciary responsibility is a legal and ethical obligation to act in the best interests of another party. In the context of a business, this means that the individual has a duty to act in the best interests of the business, its employees, and its shareholders. Paying no more tax than legally required is a way to maximize the value of the business, which aligns with the fiduciary responsibility.

Answer: 1"
402,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rick Scott was not forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud. In fact, Rick Scott was the Governor of Florida from 2011 to 2019 and has not been involved in any such fraud case. The company you are referring to is likely HCA Healthcare, which was involved in a fraud case, but Rick Scott was not the CEO or involved in the company's operations during that time.

Answer: 0"
403,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government restricts how much salt we can put on our food is false. While the U.S. government does recommend limiting salt intake to reduce health risks, it does not impose specific restrictions on the amount of salt individuals can use in their food. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day, but this is a recommendation, not a regulation.

Answer: 0"
404,"Explanation: The claim is false. The NClaw (North Carolina Law) for body camera footage does not give police broad authority to keep video footage secret from individuals who are filmed. In fact, North Carolina law requires that body camera footage be made available to individuals who are the subject of the footage, with certain exceptions for privacy and safety concerns. The law also provides for public access to body camera footage, subject to certain restrictions.

Answer: 0"
405,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific incident involving a 42-inch redfish and fishing rules. Without additional context or verification, it's difficult to determine the authenticity of this claim. However, the claim itself is not inherently impossible; it's plausible that someone could catch a 42-inch redfish and be unable to keep it due to fishing regulations.

Answer: 1"
406,"Explanation: The claim about the accuracy of state job numbers is complex and depends on the specific context and data source. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, for example, regularly releases data on employment and unemployment rates, which are considered reliable and accurate. However, the accuracy of state-specific job numbers can vary depending on the methodology used by individual states and the reliability of their data collection processes. Therefore, without specific details about the source and methodology of the claim, it is difficult to definitively judge its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
407,"Explanation: The claim that ""Right now we are at 90 percent health insurance covered. That's the highest we've ever been in our country"" is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, the percentage of people without health insurance in the United States was around 8.9%, not 90%. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the data.

Answer: 0"
408,"Explanation: The claim that the No. 1 cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34 is murder is not accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading causes of death for African-American males in this age group are homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries. However, homicide is not the No. 1 cause of death overall. The CDC's data shows that unintentional injuries, such as motor vehicle accidents, are the leading cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34.

Answer: 0"
409,"Explanation: Ron Johnson, a former CEO of J.C. Penney and a current U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has been actively involved in addressing opioid abuse and heroin addiction. He has introduced legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis, such as the ""Opioid Crisis Response Act"" and the ""Opioid Addiction Prevention Act."" Additionally, he has been vocal about the issue and has participated in various discussions and hearings on the topic. Therefore, the claim that he has done nothing to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse is false.

Answer: 0"
410,"Explanation: The claim is false. While Virginia has been recognized for its business-friendly environment and has been ranked high in various surveys, it has not been named ""best managed state"" or ""best state to raise a child"" during the tenure of any specific governor. These rankings are typically based on comprehensive surveys and studies conducted by independent organizations, and they do not specifically attribute these rankings to any particular governor.

Answer: 0"
411,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. House candidate Carlos Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates is false. Carlos Curbelo has been a vocal opponent of raising flood insurance rates. He has advocated for reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that would make it more sustainable and affordable, but he has not supported raising rates for policyholders.

Answer: 0"
412,"Explanation: The claim that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit is false. This claim originated from a series of videos released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress in 2015. However, multiple investigations, including those by the FBI and the Department of Justice, found no evidence to support the claim. The videos were later found to have been heavily edited and misrepresented the context of the conversations. Planned Parenthood has consistently denied the allegations and has stated that it does not sell fetal tissue.

Answer: 0"
413,"Explanation: The claim that the new 21st State Senate district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard and was drawn within half a block of his house is a political allegation that lacks specific evidence or official confirmation. The creation of legislative districts is typically a public process involving input from various stakeholders and is subject to legal and political scrutiny. Without concrete evidence or official statements supporting this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
414,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island's voter identification law was pushed by a black Democrat in the House and a black Democrat in the Senate is false. The Rhode Island voter identification law was actually passed in 2011 by a Republican-controlled legislature. The law was not pushed by any black Democrats in the House or Senate.

Answer: 0"
415,"Explanation: The claim states that Jeff Greene only moved from California to Florida in the last two years and that he would not legally be allowed to run for any other statewide office because he has not lived here long enough to meet the residency requirement. This claim is false because Jeff Greene has been a resident of Florida for more than two years. He has been a resident of Florida since 2018, which means he has met the residency requirement for running for statewide office.

Answer: 0"
416,"Explanation: The claim is false. The individual in question, George W. Bush, was the President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 and was a strong supporter of the war in Iraq. He authorized the invasion in 2003, which was based on the premise that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The invasion was later criticized for its lack of evidence supporting the initial claims.

Answer: 0"
417,"Explanation: Terry McAuliffe, the Governor of Virginia, has not made any public statements threatening to shut down the government if his budget plan is not supported. This claim is a misrepresentation of his actual statements and actions.

Answer: 0"
418,"Explanation: The claim states that manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three years, which contradicts the earlier statement that manufacturers have been shedding jobs for more than 10 years. These two statements are mutually exclusive and cannot both be true. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
419,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fifty-one percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009"" is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, in 2009, approximately 46.4% of tax returns did not report any taxable income, which means they did not owe any income tax. However, this does not mean that 51% of households paid no income tax, as some households may have had taxable income but did not owe any tax due to credits or deductions.

Answer: 0"
420,"Explanation: The claim that Majority Leader Eric Cantor called for abolishing Social Security and Medicare is false. While Cantor has been critical of the Social Security system and has proposed reforms, he has never advocated for its complete abolition. This claim is a misrepresentation of his actual stance.

Answer: 0"
421,"Explanation: The claim is false. Donald Trump, during his presidential campaign and presidency, made several statements that suggested Muslims would be subject to profiling and other forms of surveillance. For example, he proposed a database to track Muslims in the United States and called for a ban on Muslims entering the country. These statements are well-documented and widely reported.

Answer: 0"
422,"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards was forced to concede that 86 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenue is from abortion is false. While it is true that abortion services are a significant part of Planned Parenthood's work, the claim that 86 percent of their revenue comes from abortion is an exaggeration. According to Planned Parenthood's own financial reports, abortion services account for about 32 percent of their total revenue. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual figures.

Answer: 0"
423,"Explanation: According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Georgia spends more on tourism advertising than many other states in the South. For example, in 2019, Georgia spent $15.5 million on tourism advertising, while states like Alabama and South Carolina spent less. Therefore, the claim that Georgia spends fewer tourism advertising dollars than any other state in the South is false.

Answer: 0"
424,"Explanation: The claim that foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unionization rate for all private industry workers in the United States is around 6.5%, while the rate for foreign-owned companies is around 5.5%. This indicates that foreign-owned companies have a slightly lower unionization rate than the overall private industry rate.

Answer: 0"
425,"Explanation: The claim is false. Federal grant funds for the Milwaukee streetcar project are subject to specific conditions and restrictions, but they are not exclusively tied to the streetcar project. The funds can be redirected to other modes of public transportation or to public schools if the project is canceled or if the funds are not used as intended. The claim suggests a rigid restriction that does not align with typical grant fund usage policies.

Answer: 0"
426,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's deal allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon is false. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The deal included strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure Iran's compliance. It did not allow Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.

Answer: 0"
427,"Explanation: The claim that ""nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything"" when the United States first created the federal income tax is false. The federal income tax was implemented in 1913 with the 16th Amendment, and it initially applied to a broad range of incomes. The first tax brackets were set at 1% for incomes up to $3,000, 2% for incomes up to $5,000, and 6% for incomes above $5,000. Therefore, individuals with incomes below $3,000 did not pay any federal income tax, but those with incomes above $3,000 did pay a tax.

Answer: 0"
428,"Explanation: The claim states that there are over 300 state agencies, and 45 of those are related to healthcare. This claim is true because the United States has a large number of state agencies, and many of them are indeed related to healthcare. The exact number of state agencies can vary, but the claim is generally accurate.

Answer: 1"
429,"Explanation: Abraham Lincoln did visit Ohio during his presidency, but there is no historical evidence to support the claim that he danced in the Ohio Senate chamber. The claim is likely a myth or misinterpretation of his visit.

Answer: 0"
430,"Explanation: The claim that the premiums on Medicare's prescription drug program have fallen almost every year since it began is not accurate. Medicare Part D, the prescription drug program, has seen fluctuations in premiums over the years, but it has not consistently fallen. Premiums can vary based on factors such as the specific plan chosen, the region, and the year. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

Answer: 0"
431,"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not make the statement ""This plant kills"" while pointing at a coal plant during his time as governor of Massachusetts. This claim is a misinterpretation of a statement he made about the environmental impact of coal plants, but it was not phrased as ""This plant kills.""

Answer: 0"
432,"Explanation: The claim that ""No other Northeastern state has passed a photo ID law"" is false. Several Northeastern states have implemented photo ID laws. For example, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Connecticut have all passed laws requiring photo ID for voting. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
433,"Explanation: The claim that ""government is a barrier to innovation and development"" is not universally true. While it is true that excessive regulation, bureaucracy, or lack of support can hinder innovation, governments also play a crucial role in fostering innovation through policies, funding, and infrastructure. For instance, many governments provide funding for research and development, create regulatory environments that encourage innovation, and invest in education and infrastructure. Therefore, the claim is not accurate in its entirety.

Answer: 0"
434,"Explanation: The claim about a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in inner-city schools is not accurate. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the overall dropout rate for public schools in the United States was around 5% in 2019. While dropout rates can vary significantly by location and demographic, the claim of a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
435,"Explanation: The claim suggests that individuals should unconditionally follow police orders and then deal with any potential issues later. This advice is not accurate and can be dangerous. When a police officer stops you, it is important to remain calm and cooperative, but you also have rights. You should not feel compelled to follow orders that you believe are illegal or unjust. If you feel that your rights are being violated, you should document the incident and seek legal advice.

Answer: 0"
436,"Explanation: Ohio does not have a law that explicitly allows employers or landlords to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation. In fact, Ohio's Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. Therefore, it is not legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay.

Answer: 0"
437,"Explanation: In Georgia, ride-sharing companies like Uber are required to carry auto insurance. However, the specifics of the insurance coverage can vary depending on the status of the driver (e.g., whether they are currently driving for the company or are off-duty). When a driver is logged into the app and waiting for a ride request, the company's insurance coverage typically applies. When the driver is off-duty, the driver's personal insurance may cover them. Therefore, the claim that Uber and other ride-share firms are not required to carry auto insurance under Georgia law is false.

Answer: 0"
438,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has publicly stated her support for abortion rights, including late-term abortions, but she has also emphasized the importance of reducing the number of abortions. She has not explicitly stated that she believes all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of the unborn child. This claim is a misrepresentation of her views.

Answer: 0"
439,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the conversations or the context in which they occurred. Without concrete evidence or specific details, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
440,"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey has the lowest corruption risk of any state due to the #jerseycomeback is not verifiable with the information provided. The #jerseycomeback is a hashtag used to promote a return to normalcy and economic recovery in New Jersey, but it does not directly correlate to a reduction in corruption risk. Corruption risk is typically measured by indices such as Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which is based on various factors including public sector corruption, political corruption, and business corruption. Without specific data or sources to support the claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
441,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a referendum on an aquarium for Clearwater will directly impact future funding for neighborhoods. However, there is no direct correlation between a local referendum on an aquarium and the funding for neighborhoods. The funding for neighborhoods is typically managed by separate budgetary processes and is not directly tied to the outcome of a local referendum on a specific project like an aquarium.

Answer: 0"
442,"Explanation: The claim states that Gov. McAuliffe has vetoed more bills in two years than the previous three governors did in each of their four-year terms. To verify this claim, we would need to compare the number of bills vetoed by Gov. McAuliffe in his first two years in office with the total number of bills vetoed by the previous three governors in their four-year terms. Without specific data on the number of bills vetoed by each governor, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
443,"Explanation: The claim that ""Everything I have said (on the campaign trail) has been factually accurate"" is a subjective statement that cannot be universally verified as true or false without specific examples and context. Political candidates often make statements that are later disputed or proven inaccurate. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false without further evidence.

Answer: 0/1"
444,"Explanation: The claim that 10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes is false. The Clinton Foundation has been criticized for its spending practices, with some reports suggesting that a significant portion of its funds are used for administrative costs and salaries rather than direct charitable work. The foundation has also faced scrutiny over its donations and the influence of its donors.

Answer: 0"
445,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security system was established in the United States in 1935, during the Great Depression. The average life expectancy at that time was around 61 years for men and 62 years for women. However, the Social Security system was designed to provide benefits to workers who had contributed to the system through payroll taxes. The age at which people could start receiving benefits was initially set at 65, which was higher than the average life expectancy at the time. Therefore, the claim that people died before they were old enough to get Social Security is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
446,"Explanation: The claim is false. The last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate was in 1972, as stated in the claim. However, the claim also states that ""We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate,"" which implies that the 40th anniversary is approaching. Since 1972 was 40 years ago, the claim is false because it suggests that the anniversary is still approaching, which is not the case.

Answer: 0"
447,"Explanation: The claim states that Rob Cornilles has been endorsed by 20 local mayors, including Independent, Democratic, and Republican. However, there is no specific information provided to verify this claim. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the authenticity of this endorsement.

Answer: 0"
448,"Explanation: The claim that Attorney General Eric Holder was involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation is false. In 2009, the Department of Justice under Holder's leadership did not dismiss the charges against the New Black Panther Party. Instead, the case was dismissed due to a lack of evidence and the government's failure to prove its case. Holder himself was not directly involved in the dismissal of the charges.

Answer: 0"
449,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Chris Christie owes the state money for amenities like extra Gorgonzola cheese for his staff on these trips is false. There is no evidence or credible source that supports this claim. It is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of a news story or a joke.

Answer: 0"
450,"Explanation: The claim that the Wall Street Journal ""surprisingly attacked this tax scheme"" regarding tax inversions is false. The Wall Street Journal has been known to be critical of tax inversions, but it is not accurate to describe this as a ""surprise"" attack. The newspaper has consistently reported on the topic and has expressed concerns about the practice.

Answer: 0"
451,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a person can drive the length of a football field (approximately 100 yards or 91.44 meters) in five seconds. This is highly unlikely because the average speed required to cover this distance in five seconds would be approximately 182.88 meters per second, which is far beyond the capabilities of any vehicle, including a car or a motorcycle. Even the fastest cars in the world cannot achieve such speeds.

Answer: 0"
452,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the water sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 was equivalent to three years' worth of Austin's water use. This claim is misleading because it does not specify the total amount of water used by Austin in a year. Without knowing the total annual water usage of Austin, it is impossible to accurately compare the water sent to downstream rice farmers to three years' worth of Austin's water use. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
453,"Explanation: Wisconsin does not require a photographic identification to vote. The state allows voters to present a variety of identification documents, including non-photographic ones, such as utility bills, bank statements, or pay stubs. This policy is in line with the state's voter ID law, which was implemented in 2011 but has since been modified to allow for a broader range of acceptable identification documents.

Answer: 1"
454,"Explanation: The claim suggests that learning about Donald Trump's financial dealings can be better understood by examining his financial disclosure form rather than his tax returns. This is false because financial disclosure forms and tax returns serve different purposes and provide different types of information. Financial disclosure forms provide details about assets, liabilities, and income sources, while tax returns provide information about income, deductions, and taxes paid. Both are important for understanding a person's financial situation, but they are not interchangeable. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
455,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified program in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, that guarantees a college savings account for every child who enters kindergarten.

Answer: 0"
456,"Explanation: According to recent data from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, the percentage of women in medical schools has been increasing but is not yet over half. In 2019-2020, women made up 48.5% of medical school students. Similarly, in dental schools, women constituted 58.1% of the student body in 2019-2020. In law schools, women accounted for 49.5% of the student population in 2019-2020. Therefore, the claim that over half of the young people in medical, dental, and law schools are women is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
457,"Explanation: The claim suggests that an opponent's promise to bring back old jobs is based solely on wishing away the global economy, implying that this promise is unrealistic and not grounded in practical solutions. This is a common tactic in political debates to dismiss an opponent's proposals as naive or impractical.

Answer: 0"
458,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, recall petitions are governed by state laws, and the specific rules can vary. However, in most states, including Wisconsin where Governor Scott Walker was governor, a person can only sign one recall petition for a single elected official. Signing multiple petitions for the same official is not allowed, and only the first signature counts. Therefore, the claim that it is legal to sign a recall petition even if you have already signed another recall petition is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
459,"Explanation: The Rebuild America Jobs Act is a piece of legislation introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2017. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) and Rep. John Delaney (D-MD). There is no record of the claimant co-sponsoring this bill.

Answer: 0"
460,"Explanation: The claim states that a new report proves the stimulus supported by New Jersey Democrats cost $278,000 per job. However, without specific details about the report, its methodology, and the source of the data, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim. The claim could be true, but it could also be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual data. Therefore, without further information, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
461,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support the idea that the wives of the 9/11 hijackers knew about the attacks in advance or that they traveled to Saudi Arabia to watch their husbands on television. The wives of the hijackers were not involved in the planning or execution of the attacks, and their whereabouts and activities have been thoroughly investigated by authorities.

Roland Burris was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich to fill the vacancy left by Barack Obama, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate and then to the presidency. Burris was seated in the Senate on January 15, 2009.

Answer: 1"
465,"Explanation: The claim that Obama ""remains silent"" and ""is never asked how he feels about his church honoring Farrakhan"" is false.

Answer: 0"
474,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident is true. The U.S. Navy has been operating nuclear-powered ships since the 1950s, and while there have been incidents and accidents involving nuclear reactors, none have resulted in a significant release of radioactive material. The most notable incident was the 1968 nuclear accident on the USS Thresher, which resulted in the loss of the ship and its crew, but this was not a result of a nuclear accident but rather a mechanical failure. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

488,"Explanation: The claim that a particular state was the ""worst"" in moving people from welfare to work is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""worst."" Without specific data or context, it's impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false. Different states may have different challenges and successes in this area, and what constitutes ""worst"" could vary based on factors such as the state's size, economic conditions, and specific welfare-to-work programs.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been reporting that the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, which finances Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), is expected to be depleted by 2034, not 2016. This misinformation is likely due to confusion or misinterpretation of the SSA's reports.

According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the suicide rate among veterans is approximately 20 per day, but this figure is not exclusive to older veterans and includes all veterans.

Answer: 0"
493,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language is false. While the U.S. does not have an official language at the federal level, it is not accurate to say that it is one of the very few nations without an official language.

While it is true that the bill had significant Democratic support, it also had some Republican support. The bill was passed with a vote of 307-116 in the House of Representatives and 57-21 in the Senate. While it is accurate to say that the bill had virtually no Republican support in the sense that the majority of Republicans voted against it, it is not entirely accurate to say that it passed with virtually no Republican support.

504,"Explanation: The claim that ""More businesses went out of business last year than were started for the first time in our history"" is not accurate. While it is true that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant number of business closures, it is not accurate to say that more businesses went out of business than were started. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of business applications for employer identification numbers (EINs) in 2020 was higher than in any previous year, indicating that more businesses were started than in previous years. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

510,"Explanation: The claim that Mitch McConnell is the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is a generalization and an oversimplification. While it is true that Mitch McConnell has received significant donations from individuals and organizations associated with the coal industry, it is not accurate to say that he is the only candidate receiving such donations. Many other political figures, including those from both major parties, have received donations from various industries, including coal. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
511,"Explanation: The claim is false. The national debt of the United States is approximately $16 trillion, and if we were to convert this into $1 bills, it would not cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times. The area of Ohio is approximately 44,829 square miles. If we assume each $1 bill has a thickness of 0.0043 inches (the thickness of a typical U.S. banknote), the volume of $1 bills needed to cover Ohio would be far greater than the volume of the state itself. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"

514,"Explanation: Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. During his presidency, he did reach across party lines to achieve significant legislation. For example, he worked with Republicans to pass the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Additionally, he signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was a bipartisan effort. Therefore, the claim that he ""has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done"" is false.

Answer: 0"
515,"Explanation: The claim that former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa is false. The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) is a non-profit organization that works to improve access to HIV/AIDS treatment in resource-limited settings. It has been involved in providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that CHAI distributed watered-down drugs. The organization has been recognized for its efforts in improving access to quality HIV/AIDS treatment.

Answer: 0"
516,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study of private bail bond systems, which suggests that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states. However, without specific details about the study, its methodology, and the data used, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. Additionally, no-show rates can be influenced by various factors such as the severity of the crime, the defendant's personal circumstances, and the effectiveness of the bail bond system itself. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false without further information.

Answer: 0"
517,"Explanation: The claim suggests that scientists are now advising to leave nuclear waste where it is, implying that the problem of nuclear waste disposal has been solved. However, this is a simplification and not entirely accurate. While some scientists and experts have proposed various methods for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, including leaving it in place under certain conditions, the consensus is that the problem is far from solved. The storage and disposal of nuclear waste remain significant challenges in the field of nuclear energy. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
518,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not estimated that it must hire 16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to enforce the federal health care overhaul.

523,"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee has the second-highest number of children recovered from sex trafficking is not accurate. According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), the number of children recovered from sex trafficking varies by location, and Milwaukee does not consistently rank as having the second-highest number of recovered children. The NCMEC's data shows that the number of recovered children can fluctuate, and rankings can change from year to year.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average price of regular gasoline in the United States has been higher in the past, particularly in the 2008 and 2011-2014 periods. The current prices are indeed high, but they are not unprecedented.

Answer: 0"
528,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States uses the Electoral College system to elect the President, where each state's electoral votes are allocated based on its representation in Congress. Texas, California, and New York have a combined total of 55 electoral votes, which is more than half of the 538 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. However, it is not mathematically impossible for Republicans to elect a president because the remaining states could still vote for a Republican candidate, and the candidate could win the majority of electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.

Answer: 0"
529,"Explanation: The claim that ""close to 90 percent of the population growth in Texas over the last decade was non-Anglo"" is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Texas grew by approximately 10.5 million people between 2010 and 2020. While it is true that a significant portion of this growth is due to immigration, the claim that 90 percent of this growth was non-Anglo is an overstatement. The actual percentage of non-Anglo population growth is likely to be higher than the Anglo population growth, but it is not accurate to say that 90 percent of the total growth was non-Anglo.

Answer: 0"
530,"Explanation: The claim is false. The bipartisan background check amendment, known as the ""Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,"" does not outlaw any gun registry. The act expands background checks to cover more individuals, including those who purchase guns at gun shows and online, but it does not prohibit the creation or maintenance of gun registries. The claim misinterprets the legislation's intent and content.

Answer: 0"

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of BLS data.

Answer: 0"
533,"Explanation: The claim that Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons because the United States of America said it would ensure its territorial integrity from Russia is true. This is a well-documented historical event. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom. This agreement was formalized in the Budapest Memorandum, where the signatory states (the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom) agreed to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Answer: 1"
534,"Explanation: The claim that waterboarding was used on three terrorists is false. Waterboarding is a form of torture that involves pouring water over a person's face to simulate drowning. While it has been used in the past, the number of individuals subjected to this practice is not accurately stated as ""three terrorists."" The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual number of individuals who were subjected to waterboarding.

Answer: 0"
535,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statement about the number of cases brought on access to public records over a certain period.

536,"Explanation: The claim that ""nobody in higher education believes Gov. Rick Perry's proposal to serve up $10,000 college degrees is possible"" is a generalization that is not supported by evidence. While there may be some critics or skeptics of the proposal, it is not accurate to say that ""nobody"" in higher education believes it is possible. The proposal has been discussed and debated by various stakeholders in higher education, including educators, administrators, and policymakers. Some may support the idea, while others may have concerns or criticisms. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
537,"Explanation: According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the total number of violent crimes in Arizona decreased from 2019 to 2020. However, property crimes increased slightly.

Answer: 0"
538,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim, I would need to compare the salaries of faculty members across different universities in New England. However, without specific data or a reliable source, it is challenging to verify the claim.

Lincoln did propose a plan to compensate slave owners for freeing their slaves, but this was not a direct attempt to buy slaves' freedom.

Answer: 0"
541,"Explanation: A 5-cent charge on paper bags is not a tax. A tax is a compulsory financial charge or levy imposed by a government authority on a person or organization for the purpose of raising revenue. A charge on paper bags is typically a fee or surcharge imposed by a retailer or a local government to encourage the use of reusable bags and reduce waste. It is not a tax because it is not imposed by a government authority for the purpose of raising revenue.

542,"Explanation: The claim that the U.N. arms treaty will mandate a new international gun registry is false. The United Nations has been working on an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) since 2012, but it does not include provisions for a global gun registry. The ATT aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, but it does not require countries to establish a global registry of firearms. The treaty focuses on transparency and record-keeping in the arms trade, not on individual gun ownership.

Answer: 0"
543,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Rick Scott did not attend his own education summit but attended a Tea Party convention instead. This claim is false because it is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. There is no information provided to verify that Rick Scott did not attend his own education summit, and it is not accurate to imply that he attended a Tea Party convention instead without any evidence.

Answer: 0"
544,"Explanation: The 9-9-9 plan, proposed by Andrew Yang, is a tax reform plan that includes a universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 per month for every American adult. The plan also includes a 10% value-added tax (VAT) on goods and services, and a 10% tax on corporate income. While the UBI component does not raise taxes on those making the least, the VAT and corporate tax increases would indeed raise taxes on many Americans. Therefore, the claim that the 9-9-9 plan does not raise taxes on those making the least is false.

Answer: 0"
545,"Explanation: The claim ""I did not support the sequester"" is a statement made by a person, and without additional context or verification, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness. The sequester refers to a budgetary process in the United States where non-discretionary spending is reduced to meet budgetary targets. The claim could be true or false depending on the specific context and the person making the statement.

Answer: 0"
546,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz voted to cut off Florida veterans and their benefits is false. Rep. Wasserman Schultz has been a strong advocate for veterans' issues and has voted in favor of legislation that supports veterans. There is no evidence to support the claim that she voted to cut off veterans' benefits.

Answer: 0"
547,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government borrows almost $60 billion per week is false. The U.S. federal government's borrowing is typically measured in terms of the debt ceiling and the deficit, not weekly borrowing. The U.S. Treasury Department reports the federal debt on a daily basis, and the weekly borrowing figures are not a standard measure. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the federal debt.

Answer: 0"
548,"Explanation: Clayton County's millage rate is indeed one of the lowest in Metro Atlanta. As of 2021, Clayton County's millage rate was 1.50, which is lower than many other counties in the region. However, it's important to note that millage rates can change from year to year, and other counties may have lower rates in different years.

Answer: 1"
549,"Explanation: The claim is based on data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. According to the FBI's 2020 Crime in the United States report, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States decreased by 24.5% from 2000 to 2019. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm also decreased, but the percentage is not specified in the FBI report. Therefore, the claim that the number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has declined by nearly 70% is not supported by the data.

Answer: 0"
550,"Explanation: The claim that former President Barack Obama opposes offshore drilling and a gas tax holiday is false.

Answer: 0"
551,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the United States spends more on its military than the next 10, 11, or 12 countries combined. However, the claim suggests that the U.S. spends more than the next 10, 11, or 12 countries combined, which is not accurate. The U.S. spends more than the next 10 countries combined, but not the next 11 or 12.

Answer: 0"
552,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no known requirement for developers to use a specific union contractor, and there is no evidence to suggest that an additional $10 million is being added to any construction project due to this requirement.

554,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or credible source that supports the statement that a federal judge has sanctioned a Tennessee birther lawyer for bringing a frivolous lawsuit. The term ""birther"" is often used to describe individuals who question the citizenship of U.S. President Barack Obama, but there is no record of a federal judge taking such action against a lawyer in this context.

Answer: 0"
555,"Explanation: The claim states that property taxes in 2009 were $3 billion below those in 2007 due to tax cuts and lower property values. However, without specific data or sources to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Property tax rates and values can be influenced by various factors, and a decrease of $3 billion over two years is a significant change that would typically require detailed economic analysis and data to substantiate.

Answer: 0"
556,"Explanation: The claim that food stamp spending doubled under President Bush and doubled again under President Obama is not accurate. While it is true that food stamp spending increased significantly during both administrations, the claim of doubling is an oversimplification. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food stamp spending increased from $30 billion in 2001 to $78 billion in 2009 under President Bush, and then to $80 billion in 2013 under President Obama. This represents a significant increase, but not a doubling in each case.

558,"Explanation: The claim that the new financial services law requires 358 regulatory filings is not verifiable with the information provided.

Without such specific information, it is impossible to determine the veracity of the claim.

Answer: 0"
559,"Explanation: The claim that the cost of a college education increased by 439 percent between 1982 and 2007 is based on a study by the College Board, which reported that the cost of tuition and fees at public institutions increased by 439 percent over that period. However, this figure includes only tuition and fees, not room and board, which are also significant components of the total cost of attendance. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of tuition and fees, it is misleading because it does not account for the full cost of attendance.

Answer: 0"
560,"Explanation: The claim that ""most tips left at Dunkin Donuts don't go to employees"" is false. In the United States, tips are typically distributed to employees, including baristas, through a system called ""tip pooling."" This means that tips are collected and then divided among all employees who work in the establishment. The exact distribution can vary by location and company policy, but the general practice is that tips are shared among the staff.

Answer: 0"
561,"Explanation: The claim ""On banning assault weapons"" is incomplete and lacks specific context. To evaluate its truthfulness, we need to know the specific context or the statement that is being made about banning assault weapons. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine if the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
562,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. loses more on tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes is not accurate. According to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the total amount of tax breaks (or tax expenditures) in the U.S. is significantly less than the total amount of personal income taxes collected. For example, in 2019, the IRS reported that the total amount of tax expenditures was approximately $1.6 trillion, while the total amount of personal income taxes collected was around $1.4 trillion. Therefore, the U.S. does not lose more on tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes.

Answer: 0"
564,"Explanation: The claim that taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals in California are ""a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare"" is misleading. While it is true that some undocumented immigrants may receive certain benefits, such as emergency medical care, it is not accurate to say that these benefits are a ""skyrocketing cost under Obamacare."" Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not provide benefits to undocumented immigrants. The ACA primarily provides benefits to U.S. citizens and legal residents. Additionally, the cost of benefits for undocumented immigrants is not funded by taxpayers but rather by the undocumented immigrants themselves through their own contributions to the healthcare system.

Answer: 0"
565,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""every income tax bracket will increase on Jan. 1, 2011"" is not accurate. The 2010 Tax Relief Act, which was signed into law by President Obama, extended the Bush-era tax cuts for two years, but it did not increase all income tax brackets. The tax cuts were extended for most taxpayers, but some high-income individuals saw their tax rates increase. Therefore, the claim that ""every income tax bracket will increase"" is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
566,"Explanation: The claim that Jeanne Shaheen was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama's political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election is false. The IRS scandal, also known as the ""IRS targeting scandal,"" involved the IRS's practice of scrutinizing conservative and liberal nonprofit groups differently. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Jeanne Shaheen was involved in this plot. The investigation into the IRS targeting scandal did not implicate Jeanne Shaheen.

Answer: 0"
567,"Explanation: The claim is false. The King Street Patriots is a group that promotes conservative and libertarian views, and they have held fundraisers featuring various speakers. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they have ever featured an author who believes that registering the poor to vote is un-American. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of the group's activities.

Answer: 0"
568,"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Bridge to Nowhere"" was a project that was proposed by Alaska Senator Ted Stevens in 2005. The project was intended to build a bridge to the remote island of Gravina in the Aleutian Islands. However, the project was highly controversial and was eventually canceled. The claim that the senator was one of a dozen who voted against the project is incorrect because the project was never voted on by the Senate.

Answer: 0"
569,"Explanation: The claim is asking about a hypothetical situation where someone is considering running for the U.S. Senate as an independent. This is a general statement about a potential action and does not provide specific information about a particular person or event.

570,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Bush did not deny health insurance to 3.8 million kids under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Answer: 0"
571,"Explanation: The claim is false. Libya does supply oil to China, but it also supplies oil to other countries, including the United States. The statement ""We get no oil from Libya"" is incorrect as the U.S. does receive oil from Libya.

Answer: 0"
572,"Explanation: The claim that there is a Republican plan to end Medicare is false. While there have been discussions and proposals within the Republican Party to modify or reform Medicare, there is no current plan or proposal to completely end the program. Medicare is a significant part of the U.S. healthcare system, and any changes to it would likely be incremental and subject to extensive debate and political process.

Answer: 0"
573,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said it is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets is false.

Answer: 0"
574,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama supported Ted Kennedy's ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition is false. There is no evidence to suggest that Barack Obama supported such a ban.

Additionally, the amendment was not included in the final version of the crime bill.

Answer: 0"
575,"Explanation: The claim is false. While Texas has been increasing funding for women's health services, the statement that they just increased their level by another $50 million for the next two years is not accurate. The Texas Department of State Health Services has been receiving increased funding for women's health services, but the specific amount of $50 million for the next two years is not supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
576,"Explanation: The claim that Tennessee's higher education funding model is 100 percent outcomes-based and that this model is already changing the way postsecondary institutions do business is not entirely accurate. While Tennessee has implemented a performance-based funding model, it is not exclusively outcomes-based. The model includes factors such as student retention, graduation rates, and other performance metrics, but it also considers other factors like institutional size and student demographics. Therefore, the claim that it is 100 percent outcomes-based is an overstatement.

Answer: 0"
577,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Islanders pay among the highest auto repair bills in the nation is not supported by reliable data. While Rhode Island may have higher costs for certain services, it is not accurate to say that it consistently ranks among the highest in the nation. Costs for auto repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific service, the location within the state, and the type of vehicle. Therefore, the claim is not true.

Answer: 0"
578,"Explanation: The claim is true. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that a particular U.S. Senator is running for re-election. However, it is a common practice for U.S. Senators to run for re-election, and many do so regularly. Therefore, the claim is not specific enough to be false, and it is a plausible scenario.

Answer: 1"
579,"Explanation: The claim that overdosing is now the number one accidental killer in the Commonwealth is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading cause of accidental death in the United States is unintentional injuries, which include motor vehicle accidents, falls, and drowning. While overdoses are a significant public health concern, they are not the leading cause of accidental death in the United States.

Without concrete evidence or official statements, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
585,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has saved $20 million through changes in criminal sentencing is not accurate. While there have been efforts to reduce incarceration costs in Georgia, the specific figure of $20 million is not supported by reliable sources. The Georgia Department of Corrections has reported savings from various initiatives, but the total savings are not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
588,"Explanation: The claim that the Ryan budget gets rid of Medicare in 10 years and turns it into a voucher program is false. The Ryan budget, proposed by then-Rep. Paul Ryan in 2011, did propose changes to Medicare, including a shift to a voucher system for future beneficiaries. However, it did not eliminate Medicare entirely. The voucher system would have provided beneficiaries with a set amount to purchase private insurance, but Medicare would have continued to exist for current beneficiaries. The claim that Medicare would be eliminated in 10 years is a misrepresentation of the Ryan budget's proposals.

Answer: 0"
589,"Explanation: The claim about the increase in the garbage tax imposed by Mayor Allan Fung in Cranston being as much as $200 is not supported by any reliable sources. The actual increase in the garbage tax was $10 per month, not $200. This information can be verified through official city documents and news reports.

Answer: 0"
591,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA does not require Americans to give up their current health plans. Instead, it provides options for those who may not have access to affordable coverage or want to change their plans. The prediction that 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan is a misrepresentation of the ACA's impact. The ACA aims to expand coverage, not to force people to change their plans.

Answer: 0"
592,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific action taken by the individual in their role as a State Legislator. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting records of the legislator for any tax increase bills they voted on. Without access to this specific data, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be accurately judged as true or false.

Answer: N/A"
593,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. is spending millions for each individual held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is not accurate. The cost of detaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay is not primarily based on the number of detainees but rather on the overall operational costs of the facility. The U.S. government has not publicly disclosed the exact cost per detainee, but it is known that the total cost of the detention facility and operations is significant. However, the claim that spending is directly proportional to the number of detainees is misleading.

Answer: 0"
594,"Explanation: The claim that FBI Director James Comey's letter about new developments in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails only went to Republican members of the House is false.

Answer: 0"
595,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama won't use the term ""war on terrorism"" is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama frequently used the term ""war on terrorism"" in his speeches and policy statements. For example, in his 2009 speech at the National Defense University, he stated, ""We must also recognize that our military efforts alone will not be enough to defeat the terrorists."" This statement, among others, demonstrates that he did indeed use the term.

Answer: 0"
596,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Senate opponent Tammy Baldwin supported a federal budget that spent trillions more money than the Obama budget is misleading. The federal budget for the fiscal year 2021, which was signed into law by President Biden, was approximately $4.8 trillion. The federal budget for the fiscal year 2016, which was the last full year of the Obama administration, was approximately $3.9 trillion. While the 2021 budget is larger than the 2016 budget, the difference is not in the trillions but rather in the hundreds of billions. Additionally, the claim does not specify which budget Tammy Baldwin supported, and her voting record does not indicate support for a budget that spent trillions more than the Obama budget.

Answer: 0"
597,"Explanation: The claim is false. The debt increased by 100% under President Obama, not 23%. The debt increased from $10.6 trillion to $19.9 trillion during his presidency, which is a 90% increase. The claim also incorrectly states that this was less than under any president going back to Ronald Reagan. In fact, the debt increased by 100% under George W. Bush and by 100% under Ronald Reagan.

Answer: 0"
598,"Explanation: The claim that you spent only $36.29 on your campaign for governor is highly unlikely. Campaigns for governor, especially in the United States, typically involve significant expenditures. The $36.29 figure is suspiciously low for such a campaign, which usually involves large sums of money for advertising, staff salaries, travel, and other expenses. Therefore, this claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
599,"Explanation: The claim that the number of terrorists has doubled is not supported by reliable data or sources. The number of terrorist incidents and groups has fluctuated over time, but there is no evidence to suggest a doubling in the past few years. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of current trends.

Answer: 0"
600,"Explanation: Medical cannabis oil, like other forms of cannabis, contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the compound responsible for the psychoactive effects. Therefore, it is possible for medical cannabis oil to get you high, especially if it is not properly dosed or if the user is not experienced with cannabis. The claim that medical cannabis oil cannot get you high is false.

Answer: 0"
601,"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion a year in Florida, and that this amounts to $700 for every household in Florida, is based on a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). However, the methodology and assumptions used in this study have been criticized by other researchers and organizations. The study's calculations are not universally accepted, and the actual costs of illegal immigration are subject to debate. Therefore, the claim cannot be considered definitively true without further verification and context.

Answer: 0"
602,"Explanation: The claim is false. The bill in question, known as the Continuing Resolution (CR), did not include funding for Planned Parenthood. However, it did not explicitly defund Planned Parenthood either. The claim is misleading because it suggests that there is no money for Planned Parenthood in the bill, which is not accurate as the bill did not address funding for Planned Parenthood at all.

Answer: 0"
603,"Explanation: The claim about the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank is true. The Export-Import Bank of the United States is a government-owned bank that provides financing to U.S. exporters. It was reauthorized in 2018 by the U.S. Congress, extending its authorization until 2022.

Answer: 1"
604,"Explanation: The claim that ""We already have $23 billion worth of debt"" is not specific enough to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. The term ""we"" is ambiguous and could refer to a country, a company, or an individual. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time period or the entity to which the debt belongs. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of this claim without more information.

Answer: 0"
605,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require industry approval before issuing a recall. Once the source of a contamination is identified, the FDA can issue a recall immediately to protect public health. The process of recalling products is governed by regulations and procedures that do not involve waiting for industry approval.

Answer: 0"
606,"Explanation: The claim states that the private sector has invested more than double the amount invested by the public sector at Quonset Business Park. To verify this claim, I would need specific data on the investments made by both sectors. Without such data, it is impossible to accurately assess the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
607,"Explanation: The claim that Wall Street hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a sheet metal worker in Parma or a school teacher in Cleveland is generally true. Hedge fund managers often have access to various tax strategies and deductions that can lower their effective tax rates. For example, they may use complex investment structures, such as partnerships and LLCs, which can provide significant tax advantages. On the other hand, the sheet metal worker and school teacher typically have more straightforward tax situations, with less opportunity for tax avoidance strategies. Therefore, the claim is supported by the general principles of tax law and the different tax treatment of various income sources.

Answer: 1"
608,"Explanation: The claim that Harry Reid and Senate Democrats only took action on veteran healthcare after news broke about veterans dying due to inadequate care is a simplification of the timeline of events. While it is true that the issue gained significant attention and momentum after reports of veteran deaths, it is not accurate to say that no action was taken before. In fact, there have been ongoing efforts and legislation related to veteran healthcare for many years. The claim also overlooks the broader context of political and legislative processes that involve multiple factors and stakeholders.

Answer: 0"
609,"Explanation: Rick Perry, the former Governor of Texas, has publicly stated that he believes in the right of states to secede from the union. However, he has also stated that he does not support secession at this time. Therefore, while he has expressed a desire for states to have the right to secede, he has not actively sought to secede from the union himself.

Answer: 1"
610,"Explanation: The claim that a Medicaid provision added to the Senate health care reform bill is ""not a special deal for Nebraska"" is false. The provision in question, known as the Nebraska Option, was indeed a special deal for Nebraska. It allowed the state to keep its existing Medicaid program, which was more generous than the standard Medicaid program, and receive federal funding to cover the costs. This provision was included in the bill to secure Nebraska's support for the legislation.

Answer: 0"
611,"Explanation: The claim that Warren Buffett has publicly said his secretary should not be paying a higher tax rate than him is false. While Warren Buffett has been vocal about the need for tax reform and has advocated for a more progressive tax system, he has not made the specific statement attributed to him in the claim. The misattribution of this statement is a common example of misinformation.

Answer: 0"
612,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 113th Congress, which met from 2013 to 2015, passed 288 bills into law, not 67. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the actual number of bills passed.

Answer: 0"
613,"Explanation: Georgia's gun laws are generally considered to be relatively permissive compared to many other states. However, it is not accurate to say that Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation. Several other states, such as Alaska, Arizona, and Wyoming, have even fewer restrictions on gun ownership and use. Therefore, the claim that Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation is false.

Answer: 0"
614,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump required every school in America to let people carry guns into classrooms on his very first day in office is false. While Trump did propose to arm teachers and school staff, he did not mandate that every school must allow people to carry guns into classrooms. His proposal was to allow states and local school districts to decide whether to arm teachers and staff, not to require it nationwide.

Answer: 0"
615,"Explanation: The claim is based on a report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is a business advocacy group. The report's findings are often criticized for being overly pessimistic and not accounting for potential economic benefits or job creation in other sectors. The specific figures of 244,000 jobs lost and $1,200 additional cost per family are disputed by many economists and environmental groups. The Chamber of Commerce's reports are often used to argue against environmental regulations, but their methodology and conclusions are not universally accepted.

Answer: 0"
616,"Explanation: The claim is about a Massachusetts governor erasing electronic communications as he left office. This practice is not uncommon among public officials, as it is often done to protect personal privacy and avoid potential misuse of public records. However, the claim does not specify which governor or provide any evidence to support the claim. Therefore, without specific details or evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim's authenticity.

Answer: 0"
617,"Explanation: The claim that ""many states are floundering under crushing deficit spending"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While some states may indeed face significant budgetary challenges, it's not accurate to say that ""many"" states are in this situation. The financial health of states varies greatly, and some states are actually experiencing surpluses or have balanced budgets. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
618,"Explanation: The claim is false. Planned Parenthood does provide mammograms as part of their health services. They offer a range of preventive health services, including breast and cervical cancer screenings, which include mammograms. The claim that Planned Parenthood only refers women to mammography providers is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
619,"Explanation: According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, in 2019, Medicaid covered 45.5% of births in Texas. This is less than half, so the claim that ""more than half of the births in Texas are paid for by Medicaid"" is false.

Answer: 0"
620,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama never made such a suggestion. The misquote originated from a Republican political ad during the 2010 midterm elections, which distorted and misrepresented his actual words. Obama's actual statement was about the potential for cost savings in the healthcare system, not about individual healthcare decisions.

Answer: 0"
621,"Explanation: The claim that ""We have had some significant accomplishments on a bipartisan basis"" is vague and does not provide specific details about the accomplishments or the context in which they were achieved.

623,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton has said that NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) was a boon to the economy is false. Hillary Clinton has been critical of NAFTA throughout her political career, including during her 2016 presidential campaign. She has argued that NAFTA has led to job losses in the United States and has not been beneficial to the economy. Therefore, the claim that she has said NAFTA was a boon to the economy is inaccurate.

625,"Explanation: The claim is false. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat from Alaska, did not cast the deciding vote in favor of President Obama's executive amnesty for illegal aliens. The executive action, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), was announced by President Obama in November 2014. However, it was blocked by a federal court and never went into effect. Sen. Begich did not play a role in the decision-making process regarding this executive action.

Answer: 0"
626,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the U.S. economy has shown signs of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, with GDP growth and employment figures improving. However, the pace of recovery can vary depending on the specific economic indicators and sectors being considered. Europe, on the other hand, has also been recovering, but the pace of recovery can differ between countries and regions within Europe. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the U.S. economy is recovering slower than Europe overall, as the recovery rates can be comparable or even faster in some European countries.

Answer: 0"
627,"Explanation: The claim that Allen West violated federal law by scuba diving with a U.S. flag is false. There is no federal law that prohibits scuba diving with a U.S. flag.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional information.)"
629,"Explanation: The claim states that the building in question is not a mosque but a cultural center with a prayer area. This claim is true because a mosque is a place of worship specifically for Muslims, while a cultural center can be a place for various cultural activities and may include a prayer area for Muslims. The claim does not contradict the definition of a mosque, and it accurately describes the building as a cultural center with a prayer area.

Answer: 1"
630,"Explanation: The claim that the odds of winning the Monopoly Millionaire instant win game are 1 in 3.27 is false. The odds of winning such games are typically much higher than 1 in 3.27. For example, the odds of winning a typical instant win game are often around 1 in 10 or 1 in 20, depending on the specific game and its rules. The claim of 1 in 3.27 is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual odds.

Answer: 0"
631,"Explanation: The claim that many citizens think a significant portion of the federal budget is devoted to foreign aid is not necessarily false, but it is not accurate to say that a full quarter or even a third of the federal budget is allocated to foreign aid. According to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the total amount of foreign aid in the U.S. federal budget is typically around 1% of the total federal budget. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
632,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal government does not typically provide loans to foreign state-owned companies for exploration activities. Such activities are usually conducted by private companies or through international agreements and partnerships. The U.S. government's role in energy exploration is typically limited to regulatory and policy-making, rather than direct financial support.

Answer: 0"
633,"Explanation: The claim that the United States had declared war on Islam over 200 years ago and that Thomas Jefferson led the charge is false. The United States has never declared war on Islam as a whole. The Barbary Wars, which were fought in the early 19th century, were conflicts between the United States and the Barbary States (Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli) over piracy and tribute. Thomas Jefferson was involved in these conflicts, but they were not directed against Islam as a religion. The claim misrepresents the historical context and the role of Thomas Jefferson.

Answer: 0"
634,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific political action and its impact on a particular organization. However, without specific details about the state, the Republican leadership, and the exact budget cuts, it is difficult to verify the claim.

Answer: 0"
635,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has seen a net loss of people with health insurance because of Obamacare is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the uninsured rate in the United States has been declining since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In 2010, the uninsured rate was 16.0%, but by 2019, it had dropped to 8.9%. This indicates that more people have gained health insurance coverage, not a net loss.

Answer: 0"

637,"Explanation: The claim about Milwaukee County mental health facility and police officers sitting in squad cars with mentally ill patients is a common misconception. In reality, when a mental health facility is full, patients are often transferred to other facilities or hospitals, and police officers are not typically involved in this process. The claim is likely a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the actual procedures in place.

Answer: 0"
638,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney is proposing a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country is false. Romney's tax plan, as proposed during his 2012 presidential campaign, included a reduction in the top tax rate for the wealthy, but it did not specify a $250,000 tax cut for every millionaire. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresentation of Romney's actual proposal.

Answer: 0"
639,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the budget of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to the amount banks generate from late fees and overdraft fees. While it is true that banks generate significant revenue from these fees, the claim does not provide specific figures or sources to support the statement that the CFPB's budget is only about 1 percent of this amount. Without concrete data, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"

The number of officers shot and killed in cold blood is 41.

Answer: 0"
641,"Explanation: The claim that repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied by Hillary Clinton's State Department is a misrepresentation of the facts. The Benghazi attacks occurred on September 11, 2012, and there were indeed requests for additional security. However, these requests were not routinely denied. The State Department had been providing security upgrades and additional personnel, but the specific requests for more security on the day of the attacks were not denied. The claim is often used to imply that Hillary Clinton was responsible for the attacks, which is not supported by the evidence.

Answer: 0"
642,"Explanation: The claim states that there has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of a specific city. This claim is false because there have been instances where aldermen have defeated incumbent mayors. For example, in the 2019 election in Chicago, Alderman George Cardenas defeated incumbent Mayor Rahm Emanuel in the Democratic primary for mayor. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
643,"Explanation: The claim ""On running a civil and polite campaign"" is a statement about the nature of a campaign, not a specific event or fact.

645,"Explanation: The claim is based on demographic projections, which are subject to change and uncertainty. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Latino population in Texas is indeed growing rapidly, and it is projected to become the largest ethnic group in the state by 2025. However, the claim specifies a timeframe of ""five to eight to ten years,"" which is more precise than the Census Bureau's projection. Therefore, while the overall trend is accurate, the specific timeframe is uncertain.

Answer: 0"
646,"Explanation: The claim that the only segment in the beer market that is growing is the craft beer segment is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the craft beer segment has been growing significantly in recent years, other segments of the beer market, such as premium and imported beer segments, have also shown growth. Additionally, the overall beer market has been experiencing a steady growth in certain regions, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification of the market trends.

Answer: 0"
647,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the claim that a $15-an-hour proposal in Cleveland is the most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country is not accurate. While Cleveland has proposed a significant increase in its minimum wage, there are other cities and states that have implemented or proposed even higher minimum wages. For example, Seattle has a minimum wage of $15 per hour, and some states like California have proposed or implemented higher minimum wages. Therefore, the claim that Cleveland's proposal is the most aggressive is not true.

Answer: 0"
648,"Explanation: The claim that 90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate in Morocco is not accurate. According to the latest data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the literacy rate for women in Morocco is around 65.5% as of 2019. This data suggests that the claim is exaggerated and not supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"

As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that Senator McCain has proposed or is advocating for an increase in the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his actual policy positions.

Answer: 0"
651,"Explanation: The claim that there are mandatory ultrasounds before abortions is false. While some states in the United States have laws requiring ultrasounds before abortions, these are not mandatory nationwide. The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) struck down a Texas law that required ultrasounds before abortions, and similar laws in other states have been challenged or struck down as well. Therefore, the claim that there are mandatory ultrasounds before abortions is false.

Answer: 0"
652,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's State Department sent three comedians to India on the ""Make Chai, Not War"" tour is false. There is no evidence or record of such an event. Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and while she did engage in various diplomatic efforts, there is no known initiative involving a tour by comedians to promote peace.

Answer: 0"
653,"Explanation: The claim that the intelligence community can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism is false. The U.S. intelligence community, including the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is subject to strict legal and regulatory oversight to prevent the collection of information on law-abiding Americans without a valid legal basis. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and other laws require a specific legal process and probable cause to collect information on U.S. citizens. The collection of business records on law-abiding Americans without a connection to terrorism would violate these laws and regulations.

Answer: 0"
654,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific incident involving Wisconsin state Sen. Jim Holperin and recall petitions. While it is possible for such incidents to occur, the claim itself does not provide concrete evidence or sources to verify the authenticity of the harassment. Without specific details or credible sources, it is difficult to confirm the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0"
655,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, Virginia's state and local governments contributed 47.5% of the total funding for public education, while the federal government contributed 8.3%. The remaining 44.2% was covered by local sources. Therefore, Virginia is not responsible for funding 55% of public education and is not paying just 41%.

Answer: 0"
656,"Explanation: The claim that uncompensated care has gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months of Medicaid expansion in the states that adopted it is not accurate. While Medicaid expansion has been shown to reduce uncompensated care, the 30 percent figure is not supported by reliable data or studies. The actual reduction in uncompensated care varies by state and is typically in the range of 10-20 percent, according to studies by the Commonwealth Fund and other reputable sources.

Answer: 0"
657,"Explanation: The claim is a generalization and does not provide specific data or examples to support its assertion. Economic growth and tax policy are influenced by numerous factors, and correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time capital gains tax has been cut, the economy has grown, or that raising it has damaged the economy.

Answer: 0"
658,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information or credible sources that confirm that David Axelrod has become a campaign advisor for Jason Carter.

Answer: 0"
659,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is the first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials is false. The term ""czar"" is often used to describe high-ranking officials in the executive branch who are appointed by the president. While it is true that Obama appointed a number of czars, the number 45 is not accurate. The actual number of czars appointed by Obama is around 20-25, depending on the source and the definition of ""czar."" Additionally, the claim that these czars replaced elected officials is misleading, as czars are typically appointed to oversee specific policy areas and do not replace elected officials.

Answer: 0"
660,"Explanation: The claim that Florida seniors are exempt from losing Medicare Advantage under the federal health care bill is false. The Medicare Advantage program is a part of the Medicare program that provides health coverage through private insurance companies. The federal health care bill, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not exempt Florida seniors from losing Medicare Advantage. The ACA actually expanded Medicare Advantage by providing additional benefits and protections for beneficiaries. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

662,"Explanation: The claim that ""Today and every day, an estimated 14,000 Americans will lose their health insurance coverage"" is based on a study by the Commonwealth Fund, which estimated that 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance coverage each day due to job loss, reduced hours, or other reasons. This claim is true.

Answer: 1"
663,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general perception of public opinion rather than specific data. While it is true that many people in the U.S. believe in more equitable distribution of wealth, the exact figure of ""nearly 6 out of 10"" is not supported by any specific survey or study. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and can be considered as potentially false.

Answer: 0"
664,"Explanation: The claim is false. The president in question is Joe Biden, and he has indeed criticized Israel for its settlement activities in the West Bank. However, he has also addressed the rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip. In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021, Biden condemned the rocket attacks and called for a ceasefire. Therefore, the claim that he said nothing about the rocket attacks is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
665,"Explanation: The claim that ""In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation"" is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""most restrictive."" Voter ID laws can vary in their requirements, such as the types of IDs accepted, the process for obtaining IDs, and the penalties for non-compliance. Without specific details about the bill in question and a comparison with other voter ID laws across the nation, it is not possible to definitively determine if this bill is the most restrictive.

Answer: 0"
666,"Explanation: The claim is about a personal recommendation made by the speaker, which is not a verifiable fact. It is not possible to independently verify whether the speaker recommended Ohio as a convention city for the GOP. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on available information.

Answer: 0"
667,"Explanation: The claim that Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts is partially true. The federal government has provided funding and equipment to local law enforcement agencies through programs like the 1033 Program, which allows the transfer of excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies. However, the extent to which this has led to a militarization of local police precincts is a topic of ongoing debate and criticism.

Answer: 1"
668,"Explanation: The claim that the majority of people trespassing in Arizona are now becoming drug mules is not supported by credible evidence or official statistics. While there have been instances of drug trafficking and human smuggling in Arizona, it is not accurate to say that the majority of trespassers are involved in these activities. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the situation.

Answer: 0"
669,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama played over 90 rounds of golf as president is false. While it is true that Obama enjoyed golf, the number of rounds he played is often exaggerated. According to various sources, including the White House, Obama played around 300 rounds of golf during his presidency, which is significantly more than 90 rounds.

Answer: 0"
670,"Explanation: The claim that this year's redistricting process in Tennessee has been the most open, interactive, and transparent in history is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""most open,"" ""most interactive,"" and ""most transparent."" Without specific data or evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to definitively judge its truthfulness. However, if the claim is based on general public perception or specific improvements in the process compared to previous years, it could be considered true.

Answer: 1"
671,"Explanation: The claim that ""100% of electric generation comes from coal"" in the 18th Congressional District is false. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the 18th Congressional District in Texas has a mix of energy sources, including coal, natural gas, and renewable energy sources like wind and solar. The district does not rely solely on coal for its electric generation.

Answer: 0"
672,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama is the first president to think he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore is false. While it is true that presidents have the power to enforce or not enforce certain laws, this is not a new concept. Presidents have always had this discretion, and it is a part of the executive branch's role in the U.S. government. The claim is an oversimplification and a misrepresentation of the president's role and the U.S. legal system.

Answer: 0"
673,"Explanation: The claim that Charlie Crist ""worked with Acorn"" to give felons voting rights is false. Acorn (Community Organizing and Research Center) is a progressive community organizing group that was active in the 2000s, but it disbanded in 2010. Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor and U.S. Senator, has never been associated with Acorn or any of its activities. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
674,"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true in many contexts, but not universally true.)"
675,"Explanation: The claim that Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close is a simplification of a complex political issue. While it is true that Republicans have been reluctant to close certain tax loopholes, especially those that benefit businesses and high-income individuals, it is not accurate to say they refuse to list any tax loophole they are willing to close. There have been instances where Republicans have proposed closing specific loopholes, such as the carried interest loophole, as part of broader tax reform discussions. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
676,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the Federal Reserve, as of the first quarter of 2021, the total amount of student loan debt in the United States was approximately $1.7 trillion. This is indeed more than the total credit card debt, which was around $800 billion in the same period.

Answer: 1"
677,"Explanation: The claim is false. Marco Rubio has publicly stated that he supports restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences, including those who have served time for non-violent offenses. He has also expressed support for certain gun control measures, but his stance on felons owning guns after serving their time is not as clear-cut as the claim suggests. The claim misrepresents his position on both issues.

Answer: 0"
678,"Explanation: The claim is false. To calculate the time it would take to pay out $1 trillion at a rate of $1 per second, we need to convert $1 trillion to seconds. $1 trillion is equal to 1,000,000,000,000 dollars. At a rate of $1 per second, it would take 1,000,000,000,000 seconds to pay out $1 trillion. To convert seconds to years, we divide by the number of seconds in a year (365.25 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute). This calculation yields approximately 31,709 years, not more than 31,000 years.

Answer: 0"
679,"Explanation: The Chevrolet Volt is an electric vehicle (EV) with a gasoline engine for extended range. The vehicle's design and safety features are optimized for the unique characteristics of an EV, which includes the placement of the battery pack and other components. Installing a gun rack in a Volt could potentially interfere with the vehicle's electrical systems, battery pack, or other critical components, and may not be safe or recommended by the manufacturer. Therefore, it is not advisable to put a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt.

Answer: 0"
680,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States imposes a penalty on individuals who do not have health insurance and do not qualify for an exemption. This penalty is calculated as a percentage of the individual's income or a flat dollar amount, whichever is higher. The penalty is not lower than the cost of buying insurance; in fact, it is designed to encourage people to purchase health insurance. The penalty is intended to be a disincentive to avoid the cost of health insurance, not to be lower than the cost of insurance itself.

Answer: 0"
681,"Explanation: The claim that the government is spending 40 percent more than what it takes in is a simplification of the government's fiscal situation. The U.S. government's spending and revenue are influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, policy decisions, and tax revenues. While it's true that the government's spending can exceed its revenue in certain periods, the claim of a 40 percent overspending is not accurate and is an oversimplification. The actual figures would need to be examined in detail to provide a precise assessment.

Answer: 0"
682,"Explanation: The claim that the biggest contribution behind a decrease in U.S. unemployment was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce is false. The decrease in unemployment is primarily attributed to the economic recovery and job growth, not to people leaving the workforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate decreased due to an increase in the number of people employed, not a decrease in the labor force participation rate.

Answer: 0"
683,"Explanation: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdoses are indeed a significant cause of death in the United States, including New Hampshire. However, the claim that drug overdoses are the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire is not accurate. The most common causes of death in New Hampshire are heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries, with drug overdoses being a significant but not the second-most common cause.

684,"Explanation: David Cicilline served as the Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island from 2006 to 2010. During his tenure, he did not explicitly declare Providence a sanctuary city. While he did advocate for policies that were more welcoming to immigrants, such as providing city services to undocumented immigrants, he did not officially designate the city as a sanctuary city. Therefore, the claim that Congressman Cicilline espoused a sanctuary city while he was the mayor of Providence is false.

Answer: 0"
685,"Explanation: The claim that 70 percent of Virginia's Medicaid costs are for seniors in nursing homes is not accurate. According to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, in 2020, about 40% of Medicaid spending in Virginia was for long-term care services, which includes nursing home care. However, this does not mean that 70% of Medicaid costs are specifically for seniors in nursing homes. The claim is an exaggeration and is therefore false.

Answer: 0"
686,"Explanation: The claim states that less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered by a referendum to levy a 1-cent sales tax. This claim is false because the sales tax is intended to cover a significant portion of Atlanta's transportation needs. The 1-cent sales tax is expected to generate approximately $1 billion annually, which is a substantial contribution to the city's transportation infrastructure. Therefore, the claim that it covers less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
687,"Explanation: The claim that former U.S. President Barack Obama described Iran as a ""tiny"" country and said it doesn't pose a serious threat is false. There is no evidence or record of Obama making such statements.

Answer: 0"
688,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney believes the Arizona SB 1070 immigration law should be the model for national immigration laws is false. During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney did not endorse SB 1070 as a model for national immigration laws. Instead, he criticized the law and stated that it was not the right approach. He proposed a more comprehensive immigration reform plan that included border security, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and other measures.

Answer: 0"
689,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the photographs or the context in which they were released.

Answer: 0"
690,"Explanation: The claim suggests that attorney general candidate Jon Richards stated he would only enforce laws with which he personally agreed. This is a significant and unusual stance for a candidate for attorney general, as the role typically involves enforcing all laws, regardless of personal agreement. Such a statement would be highly unusual and likely not accurate based on standard expectations for the role. There is no credible source provided to support this claim, and it is not a typical position for a candidate to take.

Answer: 0"
691,"Explanation: The pass rate for a high school level test to join the military can vary depending on the specific test and the military branch. However, the claim that the pass rate is 35 to 40 percent is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
692,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic that is often cited in discussions about poverty in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, approximately 37.2 million people in the United States were living in poverty. Among these, about 12.5 million were children. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"
693,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data shows that Wisconsin has experienced job growth under both Democratic and Republican administrations. According to BLS data, Wisconsin's employment increased by 11.5% from 2011 to 2021, with significant job growth occurring during the Democratic administration of Governor Tony Evers. Therefore, the claim that job creation has been fewer under Republican control is not supported by the data.

Answer: 0"
694,"Explanation: According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the number of violent crimes in the United States has been decreasing since 2014. In 2020, the FBI reported a 2.5% decrease in violent crimes compared to the previous year. This trend is consistent with data from other sources, such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which also shows a decline in violent crime rates over the past decade.

Answer: 1"
695,"Explanation: According to the World Bank, Israel's per capita income (GDP per capita) is indeed one of the highest in the world. As of 2021, Israel's per capita income was approximately $40,000, which is higher than many countries. However, it is not accurate to say that Israel's per capita income is greater than three-fourths of the rest of the world. The World Bank's data shows that Israel's per capita income is higher than many countries, but not all. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

The relationship between them was publicly known and discussed during Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Answer: 1"
699,"Explanation: President Barack Obama did indeed promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill during his first year in office. However, the bill was not passed during his first year. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2009 was introduced in the Senate in May 2009, but it did not pass. Therefore, the claim that Obama broke his promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill in his first year is false.

Answer: 0"
700,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle class and small businesses"" is misleading. In 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which included several tax provisions, but it is not accurate to say that 25 tax cuts were passed. Additionally, the claim does not specify which tax cuts were aimed at the middle class and small businesses, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of that part of the statement.

Answer: 0"
701,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Iran Nuclear Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The deal does not specify that Iran would be on the side of any country, including Israel, in the event of an attack. The JCPOA is a non-proliferation agreement and does not involve military alliances or commitments.

Answer: 0"
702,"Explanation: The claim that Texas added more jobs in 2010 than any other state is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, California added more jobs in 2010 than any other state. Texas did have a significant increase in jobs, but it was not the highest.

Answer: 0"
703,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or credible source that supports the statement that a right-wing group spent more than $100,000,000 to support Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of actual spending on political campaigns.

Answer: 0"
704,"Explanation: The claim is false. Brendan Doherty is a former White House Chief of Staff and is not currently a member of Congress or a political figure with the authority to propose or implement changes to Social Security benefits. Additionally, the claim that he wants to raise the eligibility age for Social Security benefits for anyone born after 1960 is not supported by any credible sources or official statements from him.

Answer: 0"
705,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt is as low as it has been since World War II is false. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt has been consistently increasing and is currently at its highest level since World War II. The debt has been growing due to factors such as increased government spending and lower tax revenues.

Answer: 0"
706,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Newport Tent company requires a different set of permits for each city or town they work in. This claim is likely false because most businesses, including those that set up tents, typically need similar types of permits (such as a business license, zoning permits, and health department approval) regardless of the location. The specific requirements might vary slightly, but the general process is usually consistent across different jurisdictions.

Answer: 0"
707,"Explanation: The claim states that Debbie Jackow will not de-fund the 20/20 land program. However, without specific information about Debbie Jackow's stance on this issue, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Political candidates often make promises during campaigns, but their actual policies and actions once in office can differ. Therefore, this claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
708,"Explanation: The claim is true. Since 1912, six justices have been confirmed during presidential election years. These justices are: William O. Douglas (1939), Earl Warren (1954), Potter Stewart (1971), Antonin Scalia (1986), Clarence Thomas (1991), and Samuel Alito (2006).

Answer: 1"
709,"Explanation: The claim states that property taxes are now 18% higher than when Mark Sharpe first took office. To verify this claim, we would need specific data on property tax rates at the time Mark Sharpe took office and the current property tax rates. Without this data, it is impossible to accurately assess the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false because it lacks specific data to support the 18% increase in property taxes.)"
710,"Explanation: The claim that the minimum number of infrastructure needs in Atlanta is $900 million is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific source or context given to support this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of this statement without additional information.

Answer: 0"
712,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general perception rather than specific data. While there are polls and surveys that suggest a majority of Americans support background checks for gun sales, the exact figure of ""ninety percent"" is not supported by any reliable source. According to a 2021 Gallup poll, 63% of Americans support background checks for all gun sales, which is a significant majority but not 90%.

Answer: 0"
713,"Explanation: The claim that a bill halting the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases would help stop rising gas prices is false. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates greenhouse gases primarily to address climate change, not to directly control gas prices. Gas prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and domestic production and consumption. Halting the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations would not directly address these factors and thus would not help stop rising gas prices.

Answer: 0"
714,"Explanation: The claim that the measles vaccine has killed 108 people in the last decade while no one has died of measles is false. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the measles vaccine has a very low risk of serious adverse reactions, and the vast majority of deaths from measles are due to the disease itself, not the vaccine. The claim also misrepresents the actual number of measles-related deaths, which are significantly higher than the number of vaccine-related deaths.

Answer: 0"
715,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Virginia Department of Transportation, the state has indeed had a surplus in its transportation funds, but the amount and the spending on roads are not as stated in the claim. The surplus is not a billion dollars, and the spending on roads is not less than 1 percent of that surplus. The claim exaggerates the surplus and understates the spending on roads.

Answer: 0"
716,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt added up to $75 trillion in 2010 and is on track to hit $99 trillion this year is false. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt is approximately $28 trillion, not $75 trillion. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the debt's growth over time. The debt has indeed increased significantly, but the figures provided are incorrect.

Answer: 0"
717,"Explanation: The claim that the majority of the Hispanic population and the growth of the population is U.S.-born is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2019, about 62% of the Hispanic population in the U.S. was foreign-born. While the Hispanic population is growing, the majority of this growth is due to immigration from other countries, not births within the U.S. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
718,"Explanation: The claim ""No Bridge to Nowhere could occur"" is false. The term ""Bridge to Nowhere"" is a political term used to describe a project that is not needed or is wasteful. It is often used to criticize government spending on projects that do not provide any benefit. Therefore, it is possible for a ""Bridge to Nowhere"" to occur, as it is a real phenomenon in political and economic discourse.

Answer: 0"
719,"Explanation: The claim states that Joe Kyrillos voted against women's healthcare six times. To verify this, I would need to check the voting records of Joe Kyrillos on bills related to women's healthcare. However, without specific details or a source for these votes, it is not possible to confirm the claim's accuracy. Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
720,"Explanation: The claim that food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama is false. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is the program commonly referred to as food stamps, did increase under Obama, but the increase was not two-and-a-half times. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average monthly benefit per person increased from $125.30 in 2008 to $135.00 in 2016, which is an increase of about 8%. This is not a two-and-a-half times increase.

Answer: 0"
721,"Explanation: The claim is true. 38 Studios, a video game company, raised $25 million from Wall Street investors in 2010. However, the company went bankrupt in 2012, leading to the loss of the investors' money. The Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, which had guaranteed the loans, also faced financial difficulties as a result.

Answer: 1"
722,"Explanation: President Barack Obama did not make a specific promise to keep a Wisconsin GM plant from closing. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of his administration's efforts to save the auto industry during the 2008 financial crisis. The Obama administration provided loans to GM and Chrysler to help them restructure and avoid bankruptcy, but the specific plant closures were decisions made by the companies themselves, not a result of a broken promise by the president.

Answer: 0"
723,"Explanation: The claim that most or all of global warming is due to natural causes is not supported by the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has concluded that it is extremely likely (95% confidence) that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. Natural factors, such as volcanic activity and solar radiation, contribute to climate variability, but they are not sufficient to explain the observed warming trend. Therefore, the claim that the science is in dispute is misleading, as the scientific consensus is clear and well-documented.

Answer: 0"
724,"Explanation: The claim is true. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz USA announced that it would move its corporate headquarters from New Jersey to Atlanta, Georgia. The decision was influenced by factors such as Georgia's lower corporate tax rate and business-friendly environment compared to New Jersey. This information is well-documented in various news reports and official statements from Mercedes-Benz.

Answer: 1"
725,"Explanation: The claim that State Department officials directed contracts for the Haitian recovery after the earthquake to friends of the Clintons is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. The U.S. government's response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake was led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other federal agencies, not the State Department. Additionally, there is no evidence that any contracts were awarded to friends of the Clintons.

Answer: 0"
726,"Explanation: The claim that beer drinking is not allowed in any Illinois state parks is false. Illinois state parks do allow alcohol consumption, but there are certain restrictions and regulations in place. For example, alcohol consumption is generally allowed in designated areas, such as campgrounds and picnic areas, but it is not permitted in swimming areas or on hiking trails. Additionally, individuals must be of legal drinking age and must follow all park rules and regulations.

Answer: 0"
727,"Explanation: The claim that Tommy Thompson ran Medicare into the ground and brought it nine years closer to bankruptcy is a misrepresentation of his tenure as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. Medicare's financial status is influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in healthcare costs, demographic shifts, and policy decisions. While Thompson's tenure saw some changes in Medicare policy, there is no evidence to support the claim that he directly caused Medicare to be nine years closer to bankruptcy. The claim is misleading and not supported by factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
728,"Explanation: The claim that ""On new dollar coins, In God We Trust is gone!"" is false. The phrase ""In God We Trust"" has been a part of U.S. currency since 1956 and remains on all U.S. coins and paper money, including the new dollar coins. The design of the coins may have changed, but the inscription ""In God We Trust"" is still present.

Answer: 0"
729,"Explanation: The claim that the Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia is false. The Georgia Dome was a sports and entertainment venue in Atlanta, Georgia, which was demolished in 2016. The economic impact of the Georgia Dome was primarily related to its use as a venue for events such as the Super Bowl, the NCAA Final Four, and other major events. However, the claim of a $10 billion economic impact is not supported by credible sources or studies. The actual economic impact of the Georgia Dome was likely much lower.

Answer: 0"
730,"Explanation: The claim is based on a common misconception about progressive taxation. In reality, Warren Buffett and other wealthy individuals typically pay a lower effective tax rate than their secretary due to the progressive nature of the tax system. This means that higher-income individuals pay a higher marginal tax rate, but they also benefit from various deductions, credits, and other tax advantages that lower their overall tax burden. The claim suggests that this is unfair, but it is a fundamental aspect of how the tax system is designed to redistribute wealth.

Answer: 0"
731,"Explanation: The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was a United States military policy that prohibited open discussion of sexual orientation in the military. This policy was officially ended in 2011 by the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama. However, the claim does not specify which Western countries have ended their ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policies, and it is not accurate to assume that all Western countries have done so. Therefore, the claim is not specific enough to be considered true.

Answer: 0"
732,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal debt has been increasing, but the relationship between debt and economic growth is complex and cannot be simplified to a direct ratio. The claim suggests a specific ratio ($2.52 borrowed for every $1 of economic growth), which is not accurate. Economic growth and debt are influenced by various factors, including fiscal policy, economic conditions, and monetary policy.

Answer: 0"
733,"Explanation: The claim about the Northwest Corridor highway project in Cobb and Cherokee counties creating over 9,700 jobs statewide is based on a study conducted by the Georgia Department of Transportation.

The claim that she is proposing to destroy Medicare is a misrepresentation of her actual policy positions.

Answer: 0"
735,"Explanation: The claim is false. Superdelegates are not bound to vote for the winner of the Democratic primary in their state. They are free to vote for any candidate they choose, regardless of the primary results. This is a common misconception about the role of superdelegates in the Democratic Party's nomination process.

Answer: 0"
736,"Explanation: The Keystone XL Pipeline is a proposed oil pipeline that would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States. The term ""earmark"" typically refers to a provision in a bill that directs funds to a specific project or purpose. However, the Keystone XL Pipeline is not an earmark under House rules. The pipeline's approval process involves environmental impact assessments and regulatory reviews, rather than being funded through an earmark.

Answer: 0"
737,"Explanation: The claim that Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare is false. While Florida has implemented drug testing for welfare recipients, it is not the first state to do so. Other states such as Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee have also implemented similar policies. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
738,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they are paying now is false. There is no evidence or credible source supporting this claim. Hillary Clinton's tax proposals during her 2016 presidential campaign did not target African-American owned businesses specifically and did not propose a 50 percent increase in taxes.

Answer: 0"
739,"Explanation: The claim that ""a lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they're gay"" is a misconception. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that prison environments cause individuals to change their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is a complex trait influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and personal experiences, but it is not determined by prison environments. The claim is likely a myth or misinterpretation of the experiences of some individuals who may have come out as LGBTQ+ while in prison, but this does not mean that prison causes this change.

Answer: 0"
740,"Explanation: The claim is false. Darryl Glenn, a U.S. Senate candidate from Colorado, has not proposed eliminating the Department of Education or jeopardizing college funding for 320,000 Coloradans. Glenn has stated that he wants to reduce federal control over education and increase local control, but he has not proposed eliminating the Department of Education or putting 320,000 Coloradans' college funding at risk.

Answer: 0"
741,"Explanation: The claim that the president of the United States will be taking a trip to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day is highly unlikely to be true. Presidential trips abroad are typically planned and budgeted for by the Secret Service and other government agencies, and the costs are usually much lower than the figure stated in the claim. Additionally, the claim does not provide any credible source or context to support the $200 million per day figure.

Answer: 0"
742,"Explanation: The claim that white people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex issue of wealth distribution. While it is true that certain groups may have disproportionate wealth, the claim of 90 percent is an exaggeration. According to various studies and reports, the wealth distribution varies significantly by country and region. For instance, in the United States, the top 10 percent of wealth holders control about 70 percent of the wealth, but this is not exclusive to white people. The claim also does not account for the diversity within the white population, including those who are not wealthy.

Answer: 0"
743,"Explanation: The claim that 200 consumer laws were destroyed in 2011 when Gov. Scott Walker signed Act 92 is false. Act 92, also known as the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, was a controversial piece of legislation that primarily dealt with collective bargaining rights for public employees. It did not significantly impact consumer laws. The claim of 200 consumer laws being destroyed is a misrepresentation of the actual effects of the legislation.

Answer: 0"
744,"Explanation: The claim states that Oregon ranked 25th or 7th from the bottom in percentage of children with untreated decay compared to 32 other states with similar data in 2007. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Oregon Health Authority, or other reputable health organizations that provide data on oral health in children. Without specific data or a reliable source to back up the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
745,"Explanation: The claim that Ted Kennedy sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and it contradicts historical records and the known actions of Ted Kennedy during the Cold War era. Ted Kennedy was a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and was known for his opposition to Reagan's policies, but there is no record of him sending such a letter.

Answer: 0"
746,"Explanation: The claim that Muslims attempted to establish the first Islamic Sharia court inside the United States in the town of Irving, Texas, is false. While there have been discussions and attempts to establish Sharia courts in the United States, the claim that this was the first and specifically in Irving, Texas, is not accurate. There have been other attempts and discussions about Sharia courts in various locations across the country, but no such court has been officially established.

Answer: 0"
747,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Pete Hoekstra is a former U.S. Representative from Michigan, and he served in Congress from 1999 to 2011. He is not currently a member of Congress. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that he tweeted the whereabouts of a top-secret mission to Iraq last year.

Answer: 0"
748,"Explanation: The claim about the Cuba embargo is true. The United States has maintained an economic embargo on Cuba since 1960, which has been a source of ongoing debate and controversy. The embargo, also known as the blockade, is a set of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on Cuba, restricting trade and investment between the two countries.

Answer: 1"
749,"Explanation: The claim is false. Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, did not reject legislation to make college loan payments tax deductible. In fact, he signed a bill into law in 2015 that allowed for tax deductions on student loan interest. The claim that this resulted in raising taxes on students is also incorrect, as the bill was intended to provide tax relief to students.

Answer: 0"
750,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) did conduct a survey in 2014, but the results regarding Right-To-Work legislation were not as stated. The survey found that 51% of business executives were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation, not 15%.

Answer: 0"
751,"Explanation: The claim that ""almost all"" protesters in Madison are from outside of Wisconsin is an overgeneralization and lacks specific evidence to support it. While it is true that some protesters may be from outside Wisconsin, it is not accurate to say that ""almost all"" are. The composition of protesters can vary greatly depending on the specific event and the location within Wisconsin. Therefore, the claim is not supported by reliable evidence.

Answer: 0"
752,"Explanation: The claim states that Grady Yarbrough, a Democratic runoff opponent, previously ran statewide as a Republican. This claim is false because Grady Yarbrough is a Democrat and has not run as a Republican in any previous statewide elections.

Answer: 0"
753,"Explanation: The claim is false. The debt ceiling deal in 2011, known as the Budget Control Act, did not only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade. The deal included a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases, but it did not specifically allocate funds to extend the tax cuts. The tax cuts were extended as part of a separate agreement in 2012.

Answer: 0"
754,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). According to the NCES, in the 2018-2019 school year, rural schools enrolled about 20% of American children, not 40%. However, they did receive about 22% of federal education funding. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
755,"Explanation: The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, established the direct election of U.S. senators by popular vote. It replaced the previous system where senators were elected by state legislatures. Therefore, the claim that ""On repealing the 17th Amendment"" is false because the 17th Amendment has already been ratified and is part of the U.S. Constitution.

Answer: 0"
756,"Explanation: The claim is false. The actual number of jobs created during Bill Clinton's two terms (1993-2001) was approximately 22.5 million, while during George W. Bush's two terms (2001-2009), the number was approximately 11.5 million. The claim incorrectly states that only 3 million jobs were created during Bush's term.

Answer: 0"
757,"Explanation: A government shutdown can indeed disrupt veterans benefits. During a shutdown, many government services, including those provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), may be affected. This can lead to delays or disruptions in benefits such as disability compensation, pension payments, and healthcare services. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
758,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides subsidies for health insurance based on income and family size. However, the subsidy phase-out begins at a certain income level, which is $88,000 for a family of four in 2021. This means that a family of four earning $88,000 or less would qualify for a subsidy, but those earning more would not. Therefore, the claim that a family of four can make up to $88,000 a year and still get a subsidy is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
759,"Explanation: The claim that state workers have not had across-the-board raises in six years is not verifiable without specific data or sources.

It is possible that some state workers may have received raises, while others may not, depending on various factors such as their position, department, and specific policies.

Answer: 0"
760,"Explanation: The claim that students in college used to take a popcorn popper and fry squirrel is highly unlikely. Popcorn poppers are not designed for frying squirrels, and it is not a common practice to cook squirrels in such a manner. Additionally, squirrels are not typically considered a food source in many cultures, and their preparation would require specific knowledge and tools that are not typically associated with a popcorn popper.

Answer: 0"
761,"Explanation: Ronald Reagan, during his presidency, did raise taxes on several occasions. In 1982, he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which included a tax increase. In 1984, he signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, which also included a tax increase. In 1985 and 1986, he signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which included significant tax increases. In 1987, he signed the Tax Act of 1987, which included a tax increase. Therefore, the claim that Ronald Reagan raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987 is true.

Answer: 1"
762,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has stated that supporting the right to health care means you believe in slavery is a misrepresentation of his actual views. Sen. Paul has been a vocal opponent of government-mandated health care, but he has not equated support for health care with support for slavery. The claim is a distortion of his position and is intended to mislead or misrepresent his views.

Answer: 0"
763,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums for pre-existing conditions, including pregnancy. Pregnant women can purchase health insurance on their own and are not barred from maternity coverage due to a pre-existing condition. The ACA also requires that maternity coverage be included in all health plans sold to individuals and small businesses.

Answer: 0"
764,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the cost of commuting to New York City via the Port Authority with the income tax paid to the state of New Jersey. The cost of commuting can vary greatly depending on the specific route, time of day, and frequency of travel. Additionally, income tax rates and deductions can also vary significantly. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that commuting costs are always higher than income tax paid. The claim is not supported by specific data or a general rule that applies to all individuals earning under $100,000 a year.

Answer: 0"
765,"Explanation: The claim that there are 850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2021, the total employment in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in Ohio was around 100,000 jobs. This discrepancy suggests that the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
766,"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018. During his tenure, the Republican Party did not gain control of either the New Jersey Senate or the New Jersey General Assembly. However, the claim that he is the only governor since World War II to fail in this regard is incorrect. For example, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, a Democrat, also failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body during his term.

Answer: 0"
767,"Explanation: The claim that ""Sixty-percent of the state retirees...dont get Social Security"" is false. According to the Social Security Administration, all retirees who have earned enough credits (40 quarters) are eligible for Social Security benefits.

Answer: 0"
768,"Explanation: The claim states that crime is down across the board and specifically mentions a 10 percent decrease in the most serious crimes. This claim is based on a general statement about crime rates and a specific percentage decrease. To verify this claim, one would need to look at official crime statistics from a reliable source such as the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program or similar data from other law enforcement agencies. Without specific data or a citation of the source, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
769,"Explanation: The claim that Tampa mayoral opponent Bob Buckhorn supported forcing police officers to keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers is false.

Answer: 0"
770,"Explanation: The claim that millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool under the new health care law is a misinterpretation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, also known as Obamacare, was designed to expand access to health insurance, not to force people into a government-run system. The law provides subsidies to help people afford private health insurance plans, and it also expanded Medicaid eligibility. The claim is false because it mischaracterizes the ACA's provisions and intent.

Answer: 0"
771,"Explanation: The claim is false. Police departments do not typically run advertisements that directly target drug dealers or offer to ""take their competition off the streets for FREE."" Such a statement would be unethical, illegal, and against the principles of law enforcement.

773,"Explanation: The claim is false. State laws regarding property appraisal and payment can vary, but generally, the appraisal process is used to determine the market value of the property, and the payment amount can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, negotiations, and the specific terms of the sale or transaction. The claim that the state can only pay a certain amount above the appraisal is not accurate as it oversimplifies the process and ignores the flexibility in property transactions.

Sarah Palin, as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009, implemented a policy known as the Alaska Permanent Fund, which uses a portion of the state's oil and gas revenues to provide an annual dividend to Alaska residents. This policy was indeed a significant part of her administration's efforts to share the state's wealth with its citizens.

While both have held significant political positions, the claim that Sarah Palin has more experience than Barack Obama is false because Barack Obama's experience as President of the United States is more extensive and significant than Sarah Palin's experience as Governor of Alaska.

Answer: 0"
780,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the cost of renting a U-Haul to move from San Francisco to Austin is twice as much as the cost to move from Austin to San Francisco due to a lack of trucks to flee the Golden State. This claim is false because the cost of renting a truck for a move is typically determined by factors such as distance, time of year, and demand, not by the direction of the move. The cost of renting a truck from San Francisco to Austin would be the same as from Austin to San Francisco, assuming the same truck size and rental period.

Answer: 0"
781,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not doubled its estimate for the cost of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The CBO's initial estimate for the cost of the ACA was $1.1 trillion over 10 years, not $800 billion. The CBO has revised its estimates over time, but the most recent estimates are still in the range of $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion over 10 years, not $1.7 trillion.

783,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Department of Energy's Billion Ton Study, published in 2010, actually found that wind and solar energy could provide a significant portion of the U.S. energy needs. The study estimated that wind and solar energy could provide up to 20% of the U.S. energy needs by 2030, not 5%. The study also noted that these renewable energy sources could be cost-competitive with conventional energy sources by that time.

Answer: 0"
784,"Explanation: The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly provide for just compensation when land is taken under eminent domain. Instead, the Fifth Amendment states that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. This means that the government must provide fair compensation to the owner when it takes their property for a public purpose. However, the specific amount of compensation is determined by the courts and can vary based on the circumstances.

Answer: 0"
785,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the spending on negative ads by Mitt Romney's campaign to the spending by John McCain's campaign during his entire presidential run. As of the time of this analysis, there is no publicly available data that directly supports this claim. Campaign spending data is typically reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and is not always immediately available. Therefore, without specific data from reliable sources, it is not possible to verify the claim.

Answer: 0"
786,"Explanation: The claim that some of the hijackers used New Jersey driver's licenses to board the aircraft on 9/11 is true.

Answer: 1"
787,"Explanation: The claim that for every $10,000 invested in business incubators, up to nearly 70 local jobs are generated, is not supported by reliable data or studies. While business incubators can indeed create jobs, the number of jobs created can vary greatly depending on various factors such as the industry, the specific incubator program, and the local economic conditions. There is no universally accepted figure that states for every $10,000 invested, nearly 70 jobs are generated.

Answer: 0"
788,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but misleading. While it is accurate that Presidents Harding, Kennedy, and Reagan cut taxes during recessions, the claim that they all produced ""rapid and dramatic economic recoveries"" is an oversimplification. The economic recoveries under these presidents varied in speed and magnitude. Additionally, the claim that Herbert Hoover and Barack Obama did ""the opposite"" is also misleading. Hoover did not cut taxes during the Great Depression, but his policies were not the primary cause of the economic downturn. Obama's stimulus package included tax cuts, but the claim that he did ""the opposite"" of the other presidents is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
789,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, which found that the income of the top 1 percent in the United States nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, while the income of the typical family (median income) barely increased. This study has been widely cited and is considered reliable. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
790,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain has voted with George W. Bush 90 percent of the time is false.

Answer: 0"
791,"Explanation: The claim states that ""In the last four years we've cut $36 million in ongoing revenue."" However, without specific context or verification from a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be true, but it could also be a misinterpretation or an exaggeration. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
792,"Explanation: The claim that financial conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the president and that the president does not have to have a blind trust is false. The U.S. Constitution and federal laws, such as the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, require the president to disclose their financial interests and may require them to place their assets in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest. This is to ensure that the president's decisions are not influenced by their personal financial interests.

Answer: 0"
793,"Explanation: The claim that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding decreased under President Bush is not accurate. In fact, NIH funding increased significantly during his presidency. From 2001 to 2008, the NIH budget increased from $14.9 billion to $28.6 billion, an increase of 85%. This increase was part of a broader trend of increased funding for medical research during the Bush administration.

Answer: 0"
794,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified information about Kathryn Starkey joining forces with liberal Democrats on a historic sales tax hike.

There is no credible source that supports the claim that she has joined forces with liberal Democrats on a sales tax hike.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
797,"Explanation: The claim that the radiation from new TSA body scanners is equivalent to about three minutes worth of air travel at 30,000 feet is misleading. While it is true that the radiation dose from the TSA body scanners is low, comparing it to air travel at 30,000 feet is not accurate. The radiation dose from air travel at high altitudes is primarily due to cosmic radiation, which is different from the type of radiation used in TSA body scanners. The TSA body scanners use non-ionizing radiation, specifically millimeter waves, which are not the same as the ionizing radiation encountered at high altitudes. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
798,"Explanation: The claim that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she is raped is a misinterpretation of the concept of ""rape shield laws"" and the body's natural responses to trauma. While it is true that the body can experience physical and psychological responses to trauma, including stress and shock, there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that the body can actively prevent pregnancy in response to rape. The claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
799,"Explanation: The claim that the new healthcare law crushes small businesses with billions in penalties is a simplification and an exaggeration. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does impose penalties on businesses that do not provide health insurance to their full-time employees, but these penalties are not applied to all small businesses. The penalties are only applied to businesses with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, the penalties are not billions but are calculated based on the number of full-time employees and the cost of providing health insurance. Furthermore, the ACA also provides tax credits to small businesses to help offset the cost of providing health insurance.

Answer: 0"
800,"Explanation: The claim states that despite having a president who was opposed to abortion, the number of abortions did not decrease. This claim is true because the number of abortions in the United States did not significantly decrease during the presidency of Barack Obama, who was opposed to abortion. The claim is supported by data showing that the number of abortions remained relatively stable during his presidency.

Answer: 1"
801,"Explanation: The claim that ""every school will be negatively impacted if Education Stability Fund is not tapped"" is a generalization that may not hold true for all schools. The impact of not tapping the Education Stability Fund would depend on various factors, including the specific needs and financial situations of individual schools. Some schools might have other funding sources or reserves that could mitigate the impact, while others might be more severely affected. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every school will be negatively impacted.

Answer: 0"
802,"Explanation: The claim that you were the first member of Congress to call Barack Obama a socialist is false. The term ""socialist"" was used to describe Obama by various political figures and media outlets before you made the claim. For instance, in 2008, Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the House, referred to Obama as a ""radical socialist."" Additionally, the term was used by other political figures and in various media outlets before your claim.

Answer: 0"
803,"Explanation: The claim that the United States sends a billion dollars to foreign countries every day due to its addiction to foreign oil is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate. While the U.S. does import a significant amount of oil, the total cost of these imports is not a billion dollars per day. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average daily cost of oil imports in 2021 was around $100 million, not a billion dollars. Additionally, the U.S. is also a major oil producer and exporter, which helps to balance the trade.

Answer: 0"
804,"Explanation: South Korea does pay the United States for the presence of U.S. troops on its soil. The cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement (SMA), was renewed in 2019 and covers a portion of the costs for the U.S. military presence in South Korea. The agreement is part of the broader alliance between the two countries, which includes mutual defense commitments.

Answer: 0"
805,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. is giving seven Alaskan islands to Russia is false.

Answer: 0"
806,"Explanation: The claim that the military accounts for about 10 percent of Florida's economy is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the defense sector contributes around 2.5% to Florida's economy. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
807,"Explanation: The claim that Medicaid expansion could cost the Commonwealth of Virginia over $1 billion a year is based on a study conducted by the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis.

808,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is a global terrorist organization that has controlled significant territories in Iraq and Syria at various points in time. While its influence and territory have diminished in recent years, it is still active and has a presence in multiple countries. The claim that it is so small it couldn't fill a Double-A baseball park in Charleston, W. Va., is an exaggeration and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
809,"Explanation: The claim that poor people do not abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group is not accurate. Numerous studies and reports have shown that individuals from lower-income backgrounds are more likely to engage in substance abuse, including drugs. This is often due to a combination of factors such as stress, lack of access to healthcare, and limited education. For instance, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has reported that lower-income individuals are more likely to use and abuse drugs due to the stress and hardships associated with poverty.

Answer: 0"
810,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim that Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth over the year, we need to consider data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis or the U.S. Census Bureau. As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have specific data on personal income growth for Wisconsin compared to other Midwest states for the current year. However, typically, such rankings are based on annual reports and comparisons that are released periodically. Without specific data for the current year, it is not possible to definitively say whether Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth.

Answer: 0"
811,"Explanation: The claim that the Democrats' health care bills would provide ""free health care for illegal immigrants"" is false. While some Democratic proposals have included provisions to expand access to health care for undocumented immigrants, these bills do not provide ""free"" health care for all undocumented immigrants. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other Democratic health care bills typically provide access to health care services through public programs or private insurance, but undocumented immigrants are generally not eligible for these programs without additional legislation. The term ""free"" is misleading as it implies no cost, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
812,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the use of E-Verify, a system used to verify the employment eligibility of individuals, increases the likelihood of unfair job denials. However, E-Verify is designed to ensure that employers hire only authorized workers, and it does not inherently increase the chances of unfair denials. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of how E-Verify works and its intended purpose. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
813,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about which politicians are making this proposal, which groceries are targeted, or the nature of the new taxes.

Answer: 0"
820,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is an equal number of scientists who believe global warming is not happening or is not caused by human activities. This is a misrepresentation of the scientific consensus. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, the consensus is that global warming is happening and is primarily caused by human activities. The claim also implies that there is a significant number of scientists who disagree with this consensus, which is not accurate. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that global warming is occurring and is primarily human-induced.

Answer: 0"
821,"Explanation: The claim that ""millions of Americans are paying more and getting less under Obamacare"" is a simplification of a complex issue. While it is true that some people have experienced higher premiums and reduced coverage under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), this is not a universal experience. Many people have benefited from the law, including those who were previously uninsured, those who received subsidies to lower their premiums, and those who gained access to preventive care and essential health benefits. The claim also does not account for the overall impact of the law, which has led to a significant reduction in the uninsured rate and improved access to healthcare for many Americans.

Answer: 0"
822,"Explanation: When Barack Obama took office in 2009, the Democratic Party held 257 seats in the House of Representatives and 59 seats in the Senate, which was indeed a significant majority. However, the claim that this was the biggest Democratic majority in Congress since Lyndon Johnson is not accurate. In 1965, Lyndon Johnson's Democratic Party held 295 seats in the House and 67 seats in the Senate, which was a larger majority than Obama's.

Answer: 0"
823,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is getting his nominees confirmed faster than President George W. Bush was at the same time in his second term is not accurate. According to data from the Senate, President Obama had a higher rate of confirmations for his nominees compared to President Bush during his second term. However, the claim suggests the opposite, which is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
824,"Explanation: President Barack Obama did not promise to cut the deficit in half. During his 2008 presidential campaign, he proposed a plan to reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over 10 years, but this was not a promise to cut the deficit in half. The claim is therefore false.

Answer: 0"
825,"Explanation: The claim that Democratic Wisconsin state senators rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input is false. The Wisconsin State Senate passed a budget bill in 2009 that included a tax increase, but the process was not as rushed or secretive as the claim suggests. The budget bill was debated and amended over several months, and there were public hearings and input from various stakeholders. The claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
826,"Explanation: The claim that 90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes is not accurate. While there is broad support for background checks in general, the specific percentage of Americans who support closing loopholes in background checks is not as high as 90%. According to various polls and surveys, support for background checks typically ranges from 70% to 90%, but the specific support for closing loopholes is not as widely reported or as high.

831,"Explanation: Preventive care, such as regular check-ups, screenings, and immunizations, can indeed save money in the long run.

Answer: 1"
832,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Connie Mack IV co-sponsored a bill to take a third of the Social Security Trust Fund and give it to individual accounts for seniors to invest in the stock market.

Answer: 0"
833,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific incident involving the National Guard and their helicopter availability during a flooding event.

The claim could be true, but it lacks sufficient evidence to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
834,"Explanation: The claim that Fulton County has successfully reduced the number of pregnancies among 15- to 19-year-olds is not verifiable with the information provided.

Answer: 0"
835,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats cut $35 million from the state budget for Information Technology improvements is false.

836,"Explanation: Austin Pease Elementary is a school located in the Austin Independent School District in Texas. However, it was not created as part of the Texas Constitution. The Texas Constitution is the state's governing document, and schools are established and operated by the state's education system, not created by the constitution itself. Therefore, the claim that Austin Pease Elementary was created as part of the Texas Constitution is false.

Answer: 0"
837,"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is likely referring to their own experience.

The claim could be true if the person is indeed the only one with a private sector job on the stage, but it could also be false if there are others with similar experiences.

Answer: 0/1"
838,"Explanation: The claim is false. While pharmacies do have databases to manage prescription drugs, these databases are not designed to track and manage all prescription drugs across the entire healthcare system. A separate prescription drug database would be beneficial for tracking drug usage, identifying potential drug interactions, and monitoring the effectiveness of treatments on a larger scale. The current pharmacy databases are more focused on inventory management and patient-specific records rather than providing a comprehensive overview of prescription drug usage across the entire population.

Answer: 0"
839,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did not force people out of their health plans. However, it did require individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty, which led some people to drop their plans. Additionally, the ACA introduced new regulations and requirements for health insurance plans, which could have caused some people to switch to different plans or drop their coverage altogether. Therefore, while the ACA did not explicitly force people out of their health plans, it did create circumstances that led some people to change their coverage.

Answer: 0"
840,"Explanation: The claim is true. J.D. Hayworth, a former Republican congressman from Illinois, was indeed voted out of Congress in 2010. After leaving Congress, he became a registered lobbyist and was paid by a Florida corporation to lobby the very committee he used to serve on.

For instance, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) conducted an investigation into the university's response to the shootings. This investigation included meetings with university officials, including the president and the police chief. Therefore, the claim that they have not once gotten into the car and driven down to Blacksburg to talk to anyone is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
843,"Explanation: The claim that Damascus disincorporation would produce NO significant tax savings is false. Disincorporation, or the process of a city or town dissolving its corporate status, can indeed lead to significant tax savings.

Therefore, the claim that there would be NO significant tax savings is incorrect.

Cruz was born in Canada to a U.S. citizen father and a Cuban mother, and he has renounced his Canadian citizenship. The claim about a double passport is unfounded and has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations.

852,"Explanation: The claim is false. Congressman Paul Ryan did not co-sponsor legislation with Congressman Todd Akin to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of forcible rape. In fact, Paul Ryan has been a strong advocate for pro-life policies, but he did not co-sponsor any legislation with Todd Akin on this specific issue. Todd Akin, on the other hand, made controversial comments about rape and abortion in 2012, but he did not co-sponsor any legislation with Paul Ryan.

Answer: 0"
855,"Explanation: The claim that average wages have barely budged over the past four years is generally true. According to various economic reports and data from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, wage growth has been relatively stagnant in recent years. This is often attributed to factors such as slow economic growth, increased automation, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the job market.

Answer: 1"
856,"Explanation: The claim is false. While federal law does not impose a limit on the number of guns an individual can purchase, there are restrictions on the number of guns that can be purchased in a single transaction.

Additionally, there are background check requirements and other regulations that apply to gun purchases.

Answer: 0"
857,"Explanation: The claim that ""Studies have shown that voter fraud is non-existent in Texas"" is not accurate. While there have been investigations and reports on voter fraud in Texas, there is no consensus that it is non-existent. In fact, several studies and reports have found instances of voter fraud, including cases of voter impersonation, absentee ballot fraud, and improper registration. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
858,"Explanation: The claim that Jennifer Brunner inherited at least 18 lawsuits when she came into the office due to Ken Blackwell's mismanagement of the 2004 election is false. While there were indeed lawsuits related to the 2004 election, the number of lawsuits and their specific attribution to Blackwell's mismanagement are not accurately stated in the claim. The claim is an exaggeration and lacks specific evidence to support the number of lawsuits and their attribution.

Answer: 0"
859,"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 babies are born deformed every year in this country due to alcoholism during pregnancy is not accurate. While fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a real and serious issue, the number of babies born with these conditions is significantly lower. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the estimated prevalence of FASDs in the United States is about 0.2-1.5 per 1,000 live births. This translates to approximately 2,000-15,000 babies per year, not 300,000.

Answer: 0"
860,"Explanation: The claim is false. Vietnam is a single country, not two separate entities. The division into North and South Vietnam was a historical situation that lasted from 1954 to 1975, during the Vietnam War. Since 1975, Vietnam has been a unified country.

Without concrete evidence, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
863,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the voting records of two different individuals, which is not directly verifiable without specific context or data. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific time period and both individuals are serving in Congress, it is possible to verify the accuracy of the claim by checking their voting records from a reliable source such as the official website of the U.S. Congress or a reputable fact-checking website.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without additional context.)"
864,"Explanation: The claim is made by Hillary Clinton, who served as the Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, her approval ratings varied, but they were generally high. According to Gallup polls, her approval rating was around 60% in 2010 and 2011, and it remained above 50% throughout her term. Therefore, the claim that she had a ""very high"" approval rating is accurate.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0"
866,"Explanation: The claim that House Republicans spent $50 million on 33 votes to repeal Obamacare is false. The claim is a misinterpretation of a report by the Center for Responsive Politics, which found that the top 33 Republican donors contributed $50 million to the Republican Party in the 2016 election cycle. This does not mean that the money was specifically spent on repealing Obamacare. The claim is a false equivalence and a misrepresentation of the data.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the information given.

Answer: 0"
868,"Explanation: The claim that it costs three times more to fight in Afghanistan than in any other place is not accurate. While the cost of operations in Afghanistan has been high due to various factors such as the rugged terrain, the need for extensive security measures, and the ongoing conflict, it is not accurate to say that it is three times more expensive than in other places. The cost of operations in Afghanistan is indeed high, but it is not three times higher than in other conflict zones or areas of operation.

This is due to advancements in technology, economies of scale, and government incentives for renewable energy.

Answer: 1"
871,"Explanation: The claim suggests a correlation between a recent economic uptick and the expectation of a new Republican Congress. However, correlation does not imply causation. Economic trends are influenced by a multitude of factors, including global economic conditions, monetary policy, and domestic economic policies. The expectation of a new Republican Congress could be a factor, but it is not the sole determinant of economic trends. Therefore, the claim is not necessarily true.

Answer: 0"
872,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a multilateral agreement signed in 2015 between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States), and the European Union. The agreement was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The claim that the person was one of the few who voted ""no"" on the Iran deal is not accurate because the deal was not voted on by the U.S. Congress; it was a multilateral agreement negotiated by the Obama administration.

Answer: 0"
873,"Explanation: The claim is referring to a specific individual named Kirk, but it does not provide any specific details or sources to support the claim that he violated Pentagon rules twice for improperly mingling politics with his military service.

Answer: 0"
874,"Explanation: The claim that Oregon has never before tried to create a land-use plan for what it should look like for 50 years is false. Oregon has indeed implemented land-use planning, including long-term plans. The Oregon Land Use Act of 1973 established a system of land-use planning that includes comprehensive plans, which are designed to guide the development of the state over a 20-year period. While the specific 50-year timeframe mentioned in the claim is not accurate, the state has a history of creating and updating land-use plans.

Answer: 0"
875,"Explanation: The claim that ""On expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act"" is true. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes provisions to expand Medicaid eligibility to more low-income individuals and families. This expansion was intended to provide health insurance coverage to more people who might not otherwise have access to it.

Answer: 1"
876,"Explanation: The claim that doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries is a misinterpretation of a study conducted by the Institute of Medicine in 1999. The study found that medical errors, including those that result in death, occur in about 98,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States. This figure does not represent the number of deaths directly caused by botched surgeries but rather the total number of deaths due to medical errors. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and misleading.

Answer: 0"
877,"Explanation: The claim is false. The White House did not brand the memorial service for the Tucson shootings with a ""Together We Thrive"" logo and slogan. The event was held in 2011, and the official branding and themes used were related to the event's purpose and the victims, not a specific logo or slogan like ""Together We Thrive.""

Answer: 0"
878,"Explanation: The claim states that taxes will have been cut by $4.7 billion in the state by the end of the current budget. However, without specific details about the budget, the source of the claim, or any official documentation, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. Tax cuts are typically announced and detailed in official budget documents, and such information would be necessary to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
879,"Explanation: The claim that President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote a letter of resignation to the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy is false. Eisenhower was not involved in the planning or execution of the Normandy landings, which were primarily the responsibility of General Bernard Montgomery and other Allied commanders. Additionally, Eisenhower did not resign after the landings; he continued to serve as the Supreme Allied Commander and later became the 34th President of the United States.

Answer: 0"
880,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama ""reversed"" on his commitment ""to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately"" is false. During his presidency, Obama did indeed announce a timeline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, but the timeline was not immediate. The withdrawal process began in 2009 and was completed in 2011, with the last U.S. troops leaving Iraq in December 2011. Therefore, the claim that he reversed his commitment to immediate withdrawal is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
881,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Center for Immigration Studies, which is a think tank known for its conservative views on immigration. The study, titled ""Criminal Alien Convictions in the United States, 2008-2014,"" found that criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, and New York during that period. However, it's important to note that the term ""criminal alien"" is often used to refer to undocumented immigrants, and the study's methodology and data sources have been criticized by some for not accurately representing the full picture of immigration-related crime. Additionally, the study's findings have been disputed by other researchers who argue that the data is misleading and that the percentage of criminal aliens is actually lower.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
882,"Explanation: The claim that repealing Obamacare saves our nation more than $2 trillion is false. The $2 trillion figure is often cited in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare's overall cost, but it does not represent savings from repealing the law. The repeal of Obamacare would likely result in increased costs for many Americans due to the loss of subsidies and protections for pre-existing conditions. The $2 trillion figure is more accurately associated with the total cost of the ACA over its lifetime, not with savings from repealing it.

Answer: 0"
883,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no constitutional amendment that bans drilling off Florida's coast. The U.S. Constitution does not have provisions that specifically address offshore drilling. Instead, the regulation of offshore drilling is governed by federal laws and regulations, such as the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The ban on drilling off Florida's coast is a result of executive orders and policies, not a constitutional amendment.

Answer: 0"
884,"Explanation: The claim is false. In President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, the words ""al-Qaida"" were indeed used. The claim that these words were never used in the address is incorrect. Additionally, the claim that this is the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001 is also false, as the words ""al-Qaida"" were used in previous State of the Union addresses.

885,"Explanation: John McCain, a Republican Senator from Arizona, was known for his conservative views on economic issues. He did vote against several minimum-wage increase bills during his time in the Senate. However, the claim that he voted 19 times against a minimum-wage increase is not accurate. According to records, he voted against a minimum-wage increase bill in 2007, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he voted against it 19 times.

Answer: 0"
886,"Explanation: The claim states that only four Texas legislators voted against a law giving in-state tuition rates to certain illegal immigrants. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that only four legislators voted against the law. In fact, the law in question, SB 175, was passed with a majority vote, and the number of legislators who voted against it was more than four. The specific details of the vote can be verified through official legislative records.

Answer: 0"
887,"Explanation: Oregon is indeed highly dependent on trade, with a significant portion of its economy driven by exports. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Oregon's exports accounted for 19.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, which is one of the highest percentages among U.S. states. This makes Oregon one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation.

Answer: 1"
888,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misunderstanding of federal tax revenue and spending. New Jersey and Kentucky, like all states, receive federal funds for various programs, but this does not mean they are getting back more than they send. The federal government collects taxes from all states and uses these funds to provide services and benefits to all Americans. The claim that New Jersey gets 61 cents back for every dollar sent to Washington and Kentucky gets $1.51 back is incorrect and misleading.

Answer: 0"
889,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everyone's jobs, including low-income African-Americans, is false. Hillary Clinton has not proposed such a policy. She has, however, supported comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but this does not involve instant work permits for millions of new immigrants. Additionally, the claim that this would take jobs from low-income African-Americans is a common misconception and not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
890,"Explanation: The claim that the United States spends $12,000 per child per year in the school system is not accurate. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average expenditure per student in the United States in 2019 was approximately $12,635. However, this figure includes all levels of education (elementary, secondary, and post-secondary) and is not specific to a single year. The claim also uses the term ""a kid,"" which is informal and not typically used in official or academic contexts.

Answer: 0"
891,"Explanation: The claim ""I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor"" is a statement that cannot be objectively verified without additional context. It could be a personal opinion or a statement made in a specific context. Without knowing the context or the speaker's identity, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: 0"
892,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's statements about Muslims are used to recruit fighters by terrorist groups is a complex issue. While it is true that some extremist groups may use political rhetoric to recruit, it is not accurate to attribute all recruitment efforts to specific statements made by a particular individual. The recruitment strategies of terrorist groups are multifaceted and often involve a combination of ideological, religious, and social factors. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that Trump's statements are directly used for recruitment.

Answer: 0"
893,"Explanation: Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 U.S. presidential election. However, Christie was not the first governor to endorse Romney.

Answer: 0"
894,"Explanation: The claim about Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Bob Graham missing a significant percentage of their votes in 2004 and 2008 is false. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of voting records. In reality, these figures are often misrepresented or exaggerated. For instance, the claim that Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes in 2008 is incorrect. Similarly, the claims about Kerry and Graham are also inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
895,"Explanation: The claim that Texans eat more catfish than residents of all other states combined is false. While Texas does have a significant catfish industry and is one of the top producers of catfish in the United States, it is not accurate to say that Texans consume more catfish than residents of all other states combined. Catfish consumption varies widely across the country, and it is not accurate to attribute the majority of catfish consumption to Texas alone.

Answer: 0"
896,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other climate agencies have reported that 2014 was not the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded. In fact, 2015 and 2016 were both warmer than 2014 in terms of global temperature.

Answer: 0"
897,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has indeed expanded health coverage to millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. However, the claim that it has ""saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans"" is not supported by specific data or studies. While the ACA has undoubtedly improved access to healthcare, the exact number of lives saved due to the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions is not quantified in a way that can be attributed to the ACA alone.

Answer: 0"
898,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the New Jersey Department of Personnel, the number of state employees has been fluctuating over the years, but it has not decreased to the level it was when Christie Whitman left office in 2001. In fact, the number of state employees has generally increased since then.

Answer: 0"
899,"Explanation: The claim that the Senate Republican education plan is an unfunded mandate for local school districts is based on the idea that the plan requires school districts to implement certain policies or programs without providing sufficient funding to cover the costs. However, the actual funding provisions of the plan would need to be examined to determine if it is indeed an unfunded mandate. Without specific details about the funding mechanisms and the extent to which the plan requires local districts to cover costs, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
900,"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate, has indeed made statements about the economy.

There is no substantial evidence or widely reported quote from McCain that directly supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
901,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories"" is not accurate. While it is true that the United States has been experiencing a decline in manufacturing jobs and closures of factories, the number of factories closing daily is not consistently 15. This claim is an exaggeration and not supported by reliable data.

903,"Explanation: The claim is false. Congressman John Lewis did not make allegations that Sarah Palin and Donald Trump were associated with the worst chapter in American history. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of Lewis' statements. Additionally, Senator Obama did not make any remarks about the association of Sarah Palin and Donald Trump with the worst chapter in American history.

Answer: 0"
904,"Explanation: The claim is false. The national debt is indeed a significant figure, but it is not accurate to say that it is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household. The national debt is approximately $28 trillion as of 2021, and the U.S. population is around 331 million. Dividing the debt by the population gives a figure of about $84,600 per person, not $48,700. Similarly, the U.S. has about 128 million households, so dividing the debt by the number of households gives a figure of about $218,000 per household, not $128,300. The claim also incorrectly states that the national debt is equivalent to the size of the entire economy. The U.S. economy is much larger than the national debt.

Answer: 0"
905,"Explanation: The claim that the House of Representatives voted to remove the word ""lunatic"" from federal law is false. The term ""lunatic"" is not used in federal law and has not been a subject of recent legislative action.

Answer: 0"
906,"Explanation: The claim that the state's budget shortfall is not that much different than it was in 2003 cannot be accurately evaluated without specific data or context. Budget shortfalls can vary significantly from year to year due to numerous factors such as economic conditions, tax revenues, and spending priorities. Without concrete figures or a comparison of the actual shortfalls for the respective years, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
907,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific time period (2011-13) and a specific group (school districts). To verify the claim, one would need to look at data from that specific time period and group. Without access to such data, it's impossible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, if the claim is based on a reliable source and the data supports it, then the claim could be considered true.

Answer: 0/1 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
908,"Explanation: The claim is referring to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The ACA expanded healthcare coverage to millions of Americans, including many in Florida. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of 2021, about 11.4 million Americans in Florida were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) due to the ACA. However, the claim of ""thirty million Americans"" is an exaggeration. The actual number of Americans who gained coverage due to the ACA is around 20 million.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
909,"Explanation: The claim that there is only one candidate under investigation, Terry McAuliffe, is false.

Answer: 0"
911,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has not been focusing on the fact that 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of data related to traffic patterns or vehicle occupancy rates. TxDOT's focus is typically on infrastructure maintenance, traffic management, and safety, not on the specific occupancy rates of vehicles.

Answer: 0"
912,"Explanation: The claim that Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go when the restrictions of the Iran nuclear deal expire is false. The Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), includes strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure Iran's nuclear activities remain peaceful. Once the restrictions expire, Iran will still be subject to international inspections and monitoring to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. The claim overstates the immediate threat and ignores the ongoing oversight mechanisms.

Answer: 0"
913,"Explanation: The claim that sixty percent of auto thefts in St. Petersburg are caused by people leaving their keys in the car is not supported by reliable data or statistics. While it is true that leaving keys in the car can be a factor in thefts, it is unlikely that such a high percentage of thefts are attributed to this specific cause. The actual percentage of thefts due to keys left in the car would likely be much lower.

Answer: 0"
914,"Explanation: The claim is false. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) is a measure of the proportion of the population that is either employed or actively seeking employment. The LFPR has been declining since the 1990s, and it was at 67.3% when Barack Obama became president in 2009. As of 2021, the LFPR is around 61.7%. If the LFPR were to remain at the 2009 level, the unemployment rate would not necessarily be 11%. The unemployment rate is influenced by various factors, including the size of the labor force, the number of job openings, and the number of people actively seeking work. Therefore, the claim that the unemployment rate would be 11% if the LFPR were the same as when Obama became president is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
915,"Explanation: The claim that there was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010 is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), there was indeed a significant increase in the number of 501(c)(4) applications in 2010. This surge was largely attributed to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the subsequent political activity surrounding it.

Answer: 0"
916,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hurricane Katrina occurred in August 2005, and the U.S. Congress did pass a $60 billion relief package in September 2005. However, Superstorm Sandy occurred in October 2012, and the U.S. Congress did not pass a $60 billion relief package for Sandy. The claim is misleading by suggesting that no relief package was passed for Sandy, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
917,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama's budget did not propose an Army with fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Army's size has fluctuated over time, but it is not accurate to say that Obama's budget proposed a reduction to the level of personnel before Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Army's size has been influenced by various factors, including the needs of the military and the political climate, but it is not accurate to make the claim as stated.

Answer: 0"
918,"Explanation: The claim states that the extra point is almost automatic and provides a specific statistic: ""The NFL had five missed extra points this year out of 1,200 some odd attempts."" This claim is false because it misrepresents the frequency of missed extra points. The NFL has a high success rate for extra points, and five missed attempts out of 1,200 is a very low number, indicating that extra points are indeed quite automatic.

Answer: 0"
919,"Explanation: The claim that ""under his tax plan, no matter where you are in the stratosphere, you're going to be getting a tax cut"" is a generalization that is not specific to any particular tax plan or individual. Tax plans can vary greatly depending on the specific provisions and the income levels they target. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say that everyone will receive a tax cut under any given tax plan without more specific information.

Answer: 0"
920,"Explanation: The claim is true. Texas has indeed been waiting for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to create insurance opportunities for the uninsured. In 2020, Texas submitted a waiver request to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to allow the state to create a reinsurance program to help lower premiums for individuals and small businesses. This proposal was part of a broader effort to address the state's high uninsured rate. As of my last update in October 2023, the federal government has not yet approved this proposal.

Without specific details or a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
922,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain voted against funding the troops because of a timeline in it to draw down American troops is false. John McCain was a strong supporter of the military and was known for his hawkish stance on foreign policy. He voted against the 2008 Defense Authorization Act because he believed it did not provide enough funding for the troops and did not address the issue of the troop surge in Iraq. He did not vote against funding the troops due to a timeline to draw down American troops.

Answer: 0"
923,"Explanation: The claim that there was a ""massive landslide victory"" in the Electoral College is false. The Electoral College is a process where each state's electoral votes are allocated based on the popular vote in that state. A ""landslide victory"" typically refers to a significant margin of victory in the popular vote, not the Electoral College. In the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, Joe Biden won the popular vote by a significant margin, but the Electoral College vote was much closer, with Biden winning 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 232.

924,"Explanation: The claim that a new bill was written into the new healthcare reform initiative ensuring that Congress will be 100 percent exempt is false. There is no such bill or provision that has been publicly disclosed or confirmed by credible sources. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and subsequent healthcare reform initiatives do not provide Congress with 100 percent exemption from the healthcare system. In fact, members of Congress are required to participate in the same healthcare system as the general public.

Answer: 0"
925,"Explanation: The claim that over 14,000 registered voters lost their vote in 2008 due to voting in the wrong precinct is false. While it is true that voting in the wrong precinct can result in a lost vote, the number of 14,000 is not accurate. The actual number of votes lost due to incorrect precinct voting in 2008 was much lower. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not based on accurate information.

Answer: 0"
926,"Explanation: The claim that the form students fill out to get college financial aid is ""longer than the form to get U.S. citizenship"" is false. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is used to apply for college financial aid, is typically shorter and simpler than the U.S. citizenship application form, which is known as the N-400 form. The N-400 form is significantly longer and more complex due to the detailed requirements for naturalization.

927,"Explanation: The claim is not verifiable with the information provided. It is a subjective statement that cannot be objectively proven or disproven without additional context or data. The claim does not specify the time period, the type of bills, or the definition of ""all the Democrats combined,"" making it impossible to accurately assess its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
928,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of the latest available data, Newt Gingrich has not raised as much money as Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee combined.

Answer: 0"
929,"Explanation: The claim states that a person has bipartisan support, including 53 sheriffs throughout the state, from both Democrats and Republicans. However, without specific evidence or sources to verify this claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy. Bipartisan support from 53 sheriffs is a significant claim and would typically be backed by concrete evidence such as endorsements, statements, or official records. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified.

Answer: 0"
930,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, the uninsured rate in Texas was 17.9%, which is indeed higher than the national average of 8.9%.

Answer: 0"
931,"Explanation: The claim ""On repeal and replace of federal health care reform"" is incomplete and lacks specific details. It does not provide enough information to determine its truthfulness. The term ""repeal and replace"" is often used in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but without specifying what is being repealed and replaced, it is impossible to evaluate the claim.

Answer: 0"
932,"Explanation: The claim that the real unemployment rate is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent is false. The official unemployment rate reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is 5.6% as of the latest data. The claim that the real unemployment rate is much higher is a common misconception, often based on misunderstandings of the official unemployment rate or the inclusion of discouraged workers and those who are underemployed. The BLS's official unemployment rate is calculated using a specific methodology that does not include all potential workers who are not in the labor force.

Answer: 0"
933,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no bill passed by House Republicans that makes it legal for single mothers to be fired by their employers. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

This misinformation is likely an attempt to spread confusion or disinformation about the voting process.

Answer: 0"
935,"Explanation: The claim is false. Vaccines are designed to prevent deadly and crippling diseases. For example, vaccines for measles, polio, and COVID-19 have significantly reduced the incidence and severity of these diseases. The claim that there are a multitude of vaccines that do not prevent deadly and crippling diseases is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
936,"Explanation: The claim that China holds 26 percent of the U.S. debt is false. As of 2021, China holds approximately 10.9 percent of the U.S. debt, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's data.

Answer: 0"
937,"Explanation: The claim that Portland has higher standards than federal guidelines on police use of force is not accurate. Federal guidelines, such as those established by the Department of Justice, provide a framework for police use of force that is generally considered to be the standard across the United States. Portland, like other cities, must adhere to these federal guidelines. While local policies may have additional or more stringent requirements, they do not supersede federal standards.

Answer: 0"
938,"Explanation: The claim that a National Football League (NFL) lockout would cost Atlanta $160 million in lost jobs and revenue is not verifiable with the information provided. The impact of a lockout on a specific city's economy, including job losses and revenue, would depend on various factors such as the city's dependence on the NFL, the number of jobs directly and indirectly related to the NFL, and the economic conditions of the city. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
939,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rates for different racial and ethnic groups can vary. As of the latest data, the unemployment rate for Latinos (Hispanic or Latino) is typically higher than the unemployment rate for whites, and the unemployment rate for blacks is often higher than that for Latinos. Therefore, the claim that the Latino unemployment rate is higher than the white rate and the black rate is higher than the Latino rate is true.

Answer: 1"
940,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama has spent over $2 million in legal fees defending lawsuits about his birth certificate is false.

Answer: 0"
941,"Explanation: The claim that ""there's no rationing in any of these bills"" is false. Rationing is a common feature in many bills, especially those related to food, fuel, or other essential resources. The term ""rationing"" refers to the controlled distribution of goods or services to ensure fairness and prevent hoarding. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
942,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no bill backed by Sean Duffy or other House Republicans that requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to conduct audits of rape victims who get an abortion. The claim is a misinterpretation of a bill that would require the IRS to audit tax returns of individuals who receive abortion services, but it does not specifically target rape victims. The bill is not related to the IRS auditing rape victims.

Answer: 0"
943,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor is a simplification of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While the ACA does introduce certain regulations and requirements for health insurance providers, it does not directly place the federal government between patients and their doctors. Instead, it aims to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health insurance and that insurance companies cannot deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The claim is misleading and oversimplifies the complex nature of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
944,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. The ACA has been widely studied and its impact on employment has been a subject of debate. Some studies suggest that the ACA may have led to a reduction in full-time employment, particularly among low-wage workers, due to the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees. However, these effects are not universally agreed upon and are often debated. The claim that the ACA will be the ""biggest job-killer ever"" is an exaggeration and not supported by the majority of evidence.

Answer: 0"
945,"Explanation: The claim that the cost to implement Florida's class size amendment has been ""$16 billion"" is false. The Florida class size amendment, which was passed in 2002, aimed to reduce class sizes in public schools. However, the total cost of implementing this amendment has been estimated to be around $1.5 billion, not $16 billion. This misinformation likely arises from confusion with the overall cost of education in Florida or other large-scale educational initiatives.

Answer: 0"
946,"Explanation: The claim that Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table of abandoning the dollar for a multinational currency is false. Timothy Geithner, who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from 2009 to 2013, never publicly proposed or discussed the idea of abandoning the U.S. dollar for a multinational currency. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his views on international monetary policy.

Answer: 0"
947,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Martin Heinrich spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas is false. The CARES Act, which was passed in March 2020, included a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to help businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds were allocated to various programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, and direct payments to individuals. The claim that the funds were spent on failed companies and jobs overseas is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
948,"Explanation: The claim that FCAT (Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test) tests account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year is false. FCAT tests are a significant part of the instructional time in Florida schools, as they are used to assess students' performance in various subjects and are a requirement for graduation. The actual percentage of instructional time dedicated to FCAT tests is not less than 1 percent but is a significant portion of the school year.

Answer: 0"
949,"Explanation: The claim that Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning is false. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, included a provision that required indoor tanning services to be treated as a medical service, which led to an increase in the cost of tanning services. However, this was not a 10 percent tax on tanning but rather a requirement for tanning services to be treated as a medical service, which increased the cost of these services.

Answer: 0"
950,"Explanation: The claim that someone sued the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) seven times is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific mention of who made the claim or any details about the supposed lawsuits. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
951,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not own 60 percent of GM, nor did his union buddies own almost 20 percent. The U.S. government, through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), owned approximately 61% of GM's shares at its peak, but this was a temporary investment to stabilize the company during the financial crisis. The government sold its shares in GM in 2013, and the union's ownership was not a significant part of the GM's equity structure.

Answer: 0"
952,"Explanation: The claim states that there are 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts since lawmakers acted. However, there is no specific law or action mentioned that would directly lead to the creation of these businesses. Additionally, there is no credible source provided to verify this claim.

Answer: 0"
953,"Explanation: The claim that gas prices have doubled because of Obama's policies is misleading and inaccurate. Gas prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and market speculation. The claim that Obama's policies directly caused gas prices to double is not supported by evidence. Additionally, the claim that Obama gave millions of tax dollars to Solyndra and blocked the Keystone pipeline is true, but these actions do not directly correlate to the doubling of gas prices. The Keystone pipeline was blocked due to environmental concerns, and Solyndra's bankruptcy was a result of market conditions and not a direct consequence of Obama's policies.

Answer: 0"
954,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, California's credit rating is not the worst in the country. California has a credit rating of AA- from Moody's, which is considered investment-grade. The state with the lowest credit rating in the U.S. is Illinois, which has a rating of BBB- from Moody's. Therefore, the claim that California has the worst credit rating in the country is false.

Therefore, the claim that Lee Leffingwell has been mayor of Austin, Texas for about as long as Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska is false.

Answer: 0"
956,"Explanation: The claim is false. The unemployment rates in Ferguson, Missouri, are not directly attributable to President Barack Obama's policies. The unemployment rates in Ferguson are influenced by a variety of factors, including local economic conditions, industry-specific issues, and broader economic trends. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that the black unemployment rate is three times higher than the white unemployment rate.

Answer: 0"
957,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) does not have the authority to prevent a company from building a factory in a state based on its labor laws. The NLRB's jurisdiction is limited to enforcing the National Labor Relations Act, which deals with labor relations and collective bargaining, not the specific labor laws of a state. South Carolina's right-to-work law does not prevent Boeing from building a factory there, as it is a matter of state law, not federal law.

Answer: 0"
958,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of deaths from gun violence in the United States to the number of deaths in the Afghanistan conflict. According to the Gun Violence Archive, as of 2021, there were approximately 24,000 deaths from gun violence in the United States. In contrast, the number of U.S. military and contractor deaths in Afghanistan, as of 2021, was around 2,400. Therefore, the claim that more people have died at the end of a gun in the U.S. since Newtown than we have lost in Afghanistan is false.

Answer: 0"
959,"Explanation: The claim that the Trump Winery near Charlottesville, Va. is the largest winery on the East Coast is false. The Trump Winery is a small, family-owned winery that produces a limited amount of wine. It is not the largest winery on the East Coast. The largest winery on the East Coast is the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Washington, which has a much larger production and more extensive vineyards.

962,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the speaker put a luxury jet on eBay, which is highly unlikely. eBay is primarily used for selling consumer goods, not luxury jets.

Answer: 0"
963,"Explanation: The claim is about Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal, which is a political statement and not a fact that can be objectively verified as true or false. The truthfulness of such a claim depends on the specific details and context of the proposal, which are subject to interpretation and debate. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false without additional context or specific details.

Answer: 0"
966,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt is on track to exceed the size of the entire economy in just two more years is an exaggeration. While the national debt is indeed growing, it is not expected to exceed the size of the economy in such a short period. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the national debt is projected to reach 102% of GDP by 2023, but this is not expected to happen in just two years. The claim is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
967,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Powell Butte water reservoir was not necessary and that the money spent on its construction could have been saved. However, this claim is not supported by evidence or context. The decision to build the reservoir was likely based on a need for water supply, which is a critical infrastructure requirement. Without specific evidence or data to support the claim that the reservoir was unnecessary, it is not possible to verify its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
968,"Explanation: The claim that Dominic Chavez is a Rick Perry Republican lobbyist is false. Dominic Chavez is a Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Texas' 23rd congressional district. He is not associated with Rick Perry or the Republican Party. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a deliberate attempt to misrepresent Chavez's political affiliation.

Answer: 0"
969,"Explanation: The claim is referring to the concept of ""underemployment"" or ""hidden unemployment,"" which includes people who are struggling to find work, have stopped looking, or are working part-time but want full-time work. The official unemployment rate, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, is based on a specific methodology that does not include these groups. The BLS defines unemployment as ""the number of people who are jobless, actively seeking work, and available to take a job."" Therefore, the claim that the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent when considering all people struggling for work or have just stopped looking is not accurate based on the official definition and methodology.

Answer: 0"
970,"Explanation: The claim that a congressional laundry closed due to the partial government shutdown is false.

Answer: 0"
971,"Explanation: The claim that under City Council Member Randi Shade, Austin had the highest city debt per person in Texas is not verifiable with the information provided.

Without specific data and context, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
972,"Explanation: The claim states that gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration's projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy. However, without specific data or official sources to verify this claim, it is not possible to definitively confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional information.)"
973,"Explanation: The claim is false. Amendment 4 in Florida, which was passed in 2018, does not have a local version that would specifically apply to St. Pete Beach. The amendment is a state-wide law that allows for the restoration of voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences and paid all fines and fees. There is no evidence to suggest that St. Pete Beach taxpayers have had to pay hundreds of thousands in legal bills due to a local version of Amendment 4.

Answer: 0"
974,"Explanation: The claim that the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders have entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope is not accurate.

975,"Explanation: The Capitol rotunda was designed by Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Henry Latrobe in the early 19th century. Its primary purpose was to serve as a grand entrance and a central gathering space for the U.S. Congress. While it has been used for various events, including protests, its original design was not intended to specifically accommodate protests. The claim that the rotunda was made to invite the people in and to accommodate protests is a misinterpretation of its historical context.

Answer: 0"
976,"Explanation: The claim that over 214,000 doctors have opted out of Obamacare exchanges is false. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as of 2021, there were approximately 100,000 physicians participating in the exchanges. The number of physicians participating in the exchanges has been declining, but the claim of over 214,000 doctors opting out is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
977,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific incentive deal approved by a certain individual for Abbott Laboratories. However, without specific details or sources to verify the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy. The claim suggests that the deal included strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met, but this information is not substantiated by any reliable source.

Answer: 0"
978,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world is false. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. has a corporate tax rate of 21%, which is lower than many other countries. For example, France has a corporate tax rate of 25%, and Germany has a rate of 29.9%. Therefore, the U.S. does not have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.

Answer: 0"
979,"Explanation: The claim that ""a legacy of taxing and borrowing crippled the economy we inherited two years ago"" is subjective and depends on the specific context and definitions of ""crippled"" and ""two years ago."" Without specific data or context, it's difficult to definitively judge the claim as true or false. However, if we consider the general economic conditions and fiscal policies of the past two years, it's possible to infer that excessive taxing and borrowing could have had negative impacts on the economy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be definitively judged as true without more specific context.)"
980,"Explanation: The claim is false. Charlie Crist, who served as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011, did not veto $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida.

Crist did not veto the entire budget request but rather made adjustments to the budget, which included cuts to various programs, including the teaching hospital.

Answer: 0"
981,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama has gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing George W. Bush is false. While it is true that Barack Obama criticized George W. Bush during his presidency, there is no evidence to suggest that he has plagiarized any of George W. Bush's policies or statements. The claim seems to be a mischaracterization or a misinterpretation of political rhetoric.

Answer: 0"
982,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump said ""all Mexicans are rapists"" is a misrepresentation of his actual statement. In a 2015 speech, Trump said, ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" This statement was widely criticized for its generalization and stereotyping. Therefore, the claim that he said ""all Mexicans are rapists"" is false.

Answer: 0"
983,"Explanation: The claim that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama in 2008 is false. While unions did contribute significantly to Obama's campaign, the total amount was not $400 million.

Answer: 0"
984,"Explanation: The claim states that the 2007-09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion, which cost every man, woman, and child in the state an extra $310. To verify this claim, we need to check the accuracy of the tax hike amount and the per capita cost.

The claim does not provide a source or reference to support the $1.8 billion tax hike figure or the $310 per capita cost. Without a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of these numbers. Therefore, the claim cannot be independently verified as true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without a reliable source.)"

986,"Explanation: The claim states that the proposed raises for the Norcross City Council would put it in line with other similarly sized communities. To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the proposed raises with the compensation of city councils in other communities of similar size. If the proposed raises align with the average or median compensation of city councils in similar-sized communities, the claim is true. If not, the claim is false.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true if the proposed raises align with the compensation of city councils in other similarly sized communities.)"
987,"Explanation: The claim is true. While the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 was a significant nuclear incident, it did not result in any deaths. The accident led to the release of a small amount of radioactive iodine into the environment, but no one was killed as a result of the accident. The claim is accurate in stating that there have been no deaths caused by a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States.

988,"Explanation: The claim that Obama spent ""40 percent of the PAC money, 43 percent to be exact, on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians"" is false.

Answer: 0"
994,"Explanation: The claim that ""illegal immigration is not actually getting worse"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While it's true that the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border has fluctuated over time, the overall trend has been an increase in illegal immigration attempts. For instance, the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border has been increasing since 2017, with a significant spike in 2021. Therefore, the claim that illegal immigration is not getting worse is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
995,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of events: apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border and births in Texas. While it is true that a significant number of people are apprehended at the border each week, the number of births in Texas is also substantial. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the state has an average of about 10,000 births per week. The number of apprehensions at the border can vary, but it is typically in the tens of thousands per week. Therefore, the claim that more people are apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border a week than are born in Texas each week is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
996,"Explanation: The claim that there was a steady reduction in U.S. debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for more than 30 years after World War II is false. While it is true that the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio decreased in the 1950s and 1960s, it has been increasing since the 1970s and has been consistently above 100% since the 1980s.
