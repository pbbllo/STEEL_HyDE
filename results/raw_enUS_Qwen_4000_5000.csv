0,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the event in question. The claim states that someone ""condemned violence at a campaign stop in Arizona in March."" Without a verified source or additional context, it's impossible to confirm whether this statement is true or false. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot make a definitive judgment.

Answer: [0]"
1,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Democratic-controlled Ohio House of Representatives took action to change the redistricting process by creating objective criteria and modifying the Constitution to remove political influence from redistricting efforts. While it is plausible that such actions could be taken to reduce political influence in redistricting, without specific legislation or constitutional amendments being passed, we cannot confirm the accuracy of this claim based solely on the given statement.

Answer: 0

The claim does not provide enough specific details to verify its accuracy. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed as true based on the information provided."
2,"Explanation: This claim is false. U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, who served as a Democratic senator from Ohio from 1993 to 2023, could not be responsible for over $14 trillion in national debt. The national debt is a cumulative figure representing the total amount of money the federal government owes, which is the result of years of budget deficits. Senator Brown's actions during his tenure would have had a negligible impact on such a large and complex figure.

Answer: [0]"
3,"Explanation: The claim suggests that consumers save an average of $500 per car when purchasing from a franchised dealer compared to buying directly from a manufacturer. This statement is too generalized and lacks specific context or data to support it. The cost savings from purchasing through a franchised dealer can vary widely depending on the brand, location, current promotions, and other factors. Additionally, many manufacturers offer incentives and discounts that can be as significant as what a consumer might save by going through a franchised dealer. Without a detailed analysis or study supporting this specific claim, it cannot be considered universally true.

Answer: [0]"
4,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Kaiser Family Foundation, prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (often referred to as Obamacare) in 2014, the uninsured rate in Wisconsin was around 13% in 2013. After the implementation of Obamacare, the uninsured rate in Wisconsin dropped significantly to about 7% in 2016. This indicates that Obamacare did have a significant impact on health insurance coverage in Wisconsin.

Answer: [0]"
5,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at credible sources such as official city reports, economic impact studies, or statements from the Atlanta government regarding the projected job creation from the Atlanta Streetcar project. Without access to these specific documents, it's impossible to verify the exact number of jobs created. However, if we assume that the claim comes from a reliable source, then it could be considered true. Conversely, if there is no supporting evidence for this number, the claim would be false.

Answer: [0]"
6,"Explanation: The claim contains two parts that need to be evaluated separately. First, it states that Wisconsin was one of the ""bluest"" states, which generally means it leans Democratic in terms of political leanings. Second, it claims that under Scott Walker's leadership, the unemployment rate was around 3.5%. 

For the first part, Wisconsin has indeed been considered a swing state with a history of voting for both Democratic and Republican candidates, but it is not typically described as ""one of the bluest states."" It leans Democratic but is not consistently one of the most liberal states.

For the second part, Scott Walker served as Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019. During his tenure, the unemployment rate did indeed decrease significantly. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin dropped from about 8.7% in January 2011 to around 3.5% by late 2018, which aligns with the claim.

Answer: [0]

The claim is partially accurate regarding the unemployment rate but incorrect in describing Wisconsin as ""one of the bluest states."""
7,"Explanation: The claim states that teachers have been working for three consecutive years without salary increases, with some individuals having gone even longer without raises. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as educational boards, unions, or government reports that detail teacher salaries over the past few years. Without such evidence, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, given the general nature of the statement and the lack of specific supporting data, we cannot confirm its truthfulness.

Answer: [0]"
8,"Explanation: The claim that the highest paid employee of the State of Rhode Island is a basketball coach is likely false. In most states, including Rhode Island, the highest paid employees are typically high-ranking officials such as the governor, state supreme court justices, or other top-level administrators in state agencies. These positions often come with significantly higher salaries than those of coaches or other professional athletes. Additionally, the salaries of state employees are usually publicly available through government transparency reports, which would reveal if a basketball coach were indeed the highest paid.

Answer: 0"
9,"Explanation: The claim ""I don't have lobbyists running my campaign"" is ambiguous because it does not specify who is making the statement or what kind of involvement with lobbyists is being denied. If a candidate or individual is stating that they do not have lobbyists directly managing their campaign, it could be true. However, it is possible for someone to indirectly influence a campaign through lobbyists without being explicitly involved in their management. Without more context about who is making the statement and what level of involvement is being denied, it is difficult to definitively verify the truth of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
10,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there has been an increase in alcohol use among underage kids despite the legal drinking age being 21. This statement is generally true because, according to various studies and reports, underage drinking remains a significant issue in many countries, including the United States. Despite the legal restrictions, there are still high rates of alcohol consumption among teenagers and young adults.

Answer: 1"
11,"Explanation: The claim suggests that under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), a bureaucrat would interfere with the patient's ability to receive necessary medical care by dictating when they could get a CAT scan. This is a generalization and not necessarily true for all situations. While it is possible that bureaucratic delays could occur in some cases, it is not a universal experience. The ACA aimed to provide more accessible healthcare, but like any system, it can face challenges such as administrative inefficiencies or insurance coverage issues.

Answer: [0]"
12,"Explanation: The claim ""On support for gay marriage"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide any specific information about levels of support, time period, country, or demographic group. To properly assess this claim, more context and details would be needed.

Answer: 0"
13,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the actual voting record of Barack Obama during his time in the U.S. Senate. Barack Obama served as a U.S. Senator from Illinois from January 3, 2005, to January 20, 2009. During this period, he did not have 150 days where he was able to vote ""present"" frequently. In fact, the term ""present"" in the context of voting refers to a type of absence from a roll call vote, meaning the senator was physically present but chose not to cast a vote. According to available records, Obama's voting record shows that he rarely used the ""present"" option for roll call votes. He generally voted either ""yea,"" ""nay,"" or abstained from voting rather than using the ""present"" option.

Answer: [0]"
14,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify several aspects: whether Bill Flores indeed had any involvement with the company in question, the number of layoffs, and the payment to executives. Without specific details about which company is being referred to and reliable sources to confirm these facts, it's impossible to definitively verify or refute the claim. The claim could be true if all parts are accurate, but without such evidence, we cannot make a conclusive judgment.

Answer: 0"
15,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult the official records of the Supreme Court decisions over the past years to verify how many times the court has ruled unanimously (9-0) that the president had exceeded his constitutional authority. Without access to these specific records or a reliable source that provides such data, it's not possible to confirm or deny the exact number of unanimous decisions regarding presidential authority. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the given information.

Answer: 0"
16,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Tammy Baldwin supports a law where the government would take over personal medical decisions, including choices about medicine, doctors, and hospitals. This is a broad and potentially misleading statement. Tammy Baldwin, who served as a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin from 2013 to 2021, was generally known for supporting healthcare reform and expanding access to healthcare services. However, there is no specific legislation in the United States that aligns with the claim of the government taking over such personal medical decisions.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was a major piece of legislation during her tenure, aimed to expand insurance coverage and improve access to healthcare but did not involve the government making individual medical decisions. Additionally, the term ""take over"" is vague and could refer to various forms of government intervention, none of which accurately describe Baldwin's stance or any existing legislation she supported.

Answer: [0]"
17,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if no action is taken and Obamacare continues to exist, Medicare will face financial insolvency within less than 10 years due to the diversion of $700 billion. However, this statement is misleading and lacks context. Obamacare, officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not directly fund Medicare. Medicare is a separate program funded by payroll taxes and premiums paid by beneficiaries. While the ACA has provisions for cost-sharing reductions and subsidies, these do not directly impact Medicare's funding.

The claim also does not specify which ""certain accounts"" of Medicare are being referred to, nor does it provide any evidence to support the assertion that Medicare would ""fall apart at the seams"" due to the existence of Obamacare. Medicare's solvency is more closely tied to its own funding mechanisms and overall economic conditions rather than the existence of Obamacare.

Answer: [0]"
18,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. John McCain spent the July 4 weekend in Islamabad, Pakistan, selling F-16s and advanced weapons to the folks who harbored Osama bin Laden is false. There is no historical evidence or credible sources supporting this claim. John McCain was a U.S. Senator from Arizona and did not engage in such activities during his tenure. Additionally, the timing of the claim does not align with known historical events and actions of Senator McCain.

Answer: [0]"
19,"Explanation: The claim ""Says Donald Trump doesn't make a thing in America"" is misleading and partially true but also contains a misunderstanding. Donald Trump, as a businessman and former president, did own and operate numerous businesses and properties throughout his career. For example, he owned hotels, golf courses, and other real estate properties across the United States. However, the phrase ""doesn't make a thing"" implies that he does not produce any goods or services, which is not entirely accurate. Trump's business ventures involved both property ownership and management rather than manufacturing.

Answer: [0]"
20,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify two aspects: the number of days John Kasich spent out of state and the amount of taxpayer money he used for his campaign. Without specific data from reliable sources such as campaign finance reports or official statements, it's challenging to confirm these figures. However, if we assume that there is accurate and verifiable information available, we would need to cross-reference this with official records.

Answer: 0

(Note: The actual answer would depend on the accuracy of the provided figures. Since no specific sources are given, and without being able to independently verify the claims, the default assumption is that the claim is false until proven otherwise.)"
21,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama's plan calls for ""mandates and fines for small businesses"" is a generalization and oversimplification of his policies. While it is true that some of Obama's policies did include mandates and fines, particularly in areas such as healthcare reform (the Affordable Care Act), these were not universal to all small businesses nor were they part of a single, overarching ""plan."" The Affordable Care Act included provisions that required certain employers to offer health insurance to their employees or face penalties, but this was part of a larger legislative package with various other components.

Answer: 0"
22,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main aspects: the distance between the proposed mine location and the venue of the public hearing, and the travel time to reach that location. The claim states that the area near the proposed northern Wisconsin iron ore mine is 15 hours away from where the public hearing was held. This statement is highly unlikely to be accurate without specific details about both locations.

Without knowing the exact locations of the proposed mine and the public hearing venue, it's impossible to verify the claim definitively. However, northern Wisconsin is a relatively small region, and travel times within this area are typically measured in hours rather than days. A 15-hour travel time would imply a distance far beyond what is reasonable for a public hearing related to a local project.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be false given the implausibility of such a long travel time for a local public hearing."
23,"Explanation: The claim ""Our credit rating went up since I've been in office"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without specific data or context about the credit rating before and after the individual took office. Credit ratings are typically assigned by independent agencies such as Moody's, S&P Global, or Fitch Ratings, and they are based on a variety of factors including financial performance, economic conditions, and management practices. Without knowing the credit rating at the beginning of the individual's term and the current rating, it is impossible to determine if the statement is accurate.

Answer: [0]"
24,"Explanation: This claim is a generalization that requires specific data to be verified. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health reports, African-American children do have higher rates of asthma-related hospitalizations and deaths compared to white children, but the exact percentage difference can vary depending on the source and the specific time period analyzed. The claim of ""500 percent more likely"" is a significant statistic and would need to be supported by reliable and recent data to be considered accurate.

Answer: [0]

The claim is not supported by the available data without additional context and specific statistics to back it up. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed as true based on the information provided."
25,"Explanation: This claim is comparing the number of people killed by police in the U.S. in one month to the number killed by police in the U.K. over a century. To evaluate this, we would need specific data on the number of police-related deaths in both countries for the relevant time periods. The U.K. has had a much lower rate of police-related deaths compared to the U.S., but without exact numbers, it's impossible to make a definitive comparison.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without accurate and comparable data from both countries for the specified time periods. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim appears to be false."
26,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records and official documents related to the loan of $75 million to 38 Studios. If there is evidence that the legislature did indeed have a chance to debate and vote on the matter, then the claim would be false. Conversely, if there is no such evidence or if it is proven that the legislature was not given this opportunity, then the claim would be true.

After researching, it has been found that the Rhode Island General Assembly did debate and vote on the loan to 38 Studios. In 2009, the state legislature approved a $75 million loan to 38 Studios, which was a video game development company founded by former Red Sox owner John Henry. The legislature held hearings and conducted debates before making the decision.

Answer: 0"
27,"Explanation: The claim that ""11 soccer players on the U.S. Men's National Team are immigrants"" is not accurate as of the latest data available. As of recent tournaments, the U.S. Men's National Team has had a mix of players born in the United States and those who have immigrated from other countries, but it does not consistently include exactly 11 immigrant players. The team composition can vary depending on the specific tournament and the eligibility rules for international competitions.

Answer: [0]"
28,"Explanation: The claim that China owns about 29 percent of the U.S. debt is false. According to the latest data from the U.S. Treasury, as of June 2023, China's holdings of U.S. Treasuries were approximately $865 billion, which represents about 2.4% of the total U.S. public debt of around $37 trillion. This figure has significantly decreased from its peak in 2014 when it was around 25% of the U.S. debt.

Answer: 0"
29,"Explanation: The claim states that Americans spend 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax law and that it costs us $163 billion annually to comply with our tax laws. To evaluate this, we need to consider reliable sources and data from tax compliance studies.

According to the Tax Policy Center, the total time spent by taxpayers on tax compliance in the U.S. was estimated to be around 2.5 billion hours in 2018, which is significantly lower than the 6.1 billion hours mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the cost of compliance, as reported by the Tax Foundation, was approximately $247 billion in 2019, which is also notably higher than the $163 billion stated in the claim.

Given these discrepancies, the claim appears to be overstating both the time spent and the cost of compliance.

Answer: [0]"
30,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the campaign contribution limits in Florida with those in other states. According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and various political finance reports, as of the latest data available, Florida's individual contribution limit for federal candidates is $2,800 per election, which is actually higher than the national average and not among the lowest. The state also has no limits on contributions to state-level candidates, which further places it above the national average in terms of contribution limits.

The states with the lowest contribution limits are typically those that have implemented strict campaign finance laws, such as Maine and Vermont, which have lower limits due to their specific state laws and regulations. Therefore, Florida does not have the second-lowest contribution limit; it is significantly higher than many other states.

Answer: 0"
31,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Linda McMahon served as the CEO of WWE from 2005 to 2019. However, there is no credible evidence or public record supporting the allegation that she tipped off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into steroid distribution among WWE wrestlers. Such an action would be highly unusual and unethical for a business leader, and it would likely have been widely reported if it had occurred. No reputable sources have verified this claim.

Answer: [0]"
32,"Explanation: The claim about David Beckham proposing a soccer stadium at Miami's port that would threaten 207,000 jobs and $27 billion in economic impact from the cargo and cruise industries is highly speculative and lacks concrete evidence. While it is possible that such a proposal could have some impact on local businesses and industries, there is no widely reported or verified information supporting these specific numbers. Economic impacts of such magnitude would typically be subject to detailed studies and analyses by economic experts, which are not referenced here.

Answer: [0]"
33,"Explanation: This claim is partially accurate but also misleading. Scott Walker did allocate significant funds for job development, but the distribution was not exclusively to campaign contributors or ""cronies."" The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) was established under Walker's administration to distribute these funds. While it is true that some of the recipients were companies that had made political contributions, the program was designed to stimulate economic growth across various sectors, not as a direct quid pro quo for campaign support.

Answer: [0]"
34,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical or factual evidence to support the assertion that President Barack Obama's actions led to Burger King pulling its franchises from U.S. military bases. Burger King, as a private company, would not make such a decision based solely on the actions of the President. Additionally, there have been no official statements or reports from Burger King or the Department of Defense regarding any such move.

Answer: [0]"
35,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not specify which president, which conflict, and the exact nature of their involvement. However, as of my last update in October 2023, there have been several conflicts involving American troops in foreign lands, including the Iraq War, the War in Afghanistan, the Libyan Civil War, and the Syrian Civil War. Without more specific details about which conflict and which president, it's impossible to verify the claim definitively. Additionally, the statement ""This is historic"" is subjective and depends on the context and significance of the event.

Answer: 0"
36,"Explanation: The claim ""says he's signed a pledge not to raise taxes four times"" needs context to be evaluated accurately. This statement could refer to various politicians who have signed tax pledge agreements, such as the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, which is often associated with the Tea Party movement and certain Republican candidates. However, without specifying the politician and the exact context, it's impossible to verify if the claim is true or false. If we assume this refers to a specific instance where a politician has indeed signed such a pledge multiple times, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if no such pledge exists or if the politician in question has not signed such a pledge, the claim would be false.

Answer: [0] (Assuming no specific context or politician is provided, and without further verification, we cannot confirm the truthfulness of the claim.)"
37,"Explanation: The claim states that a 2005 gay pride event had nothing to do with discrimination. This statement is false because gay pride events are fundamentally about raising awareness about LGBTQ+ rights, combating discrimination, and promoting equality. These events often address issues related to discrimination faced by the LGBTQ+ community, making it clear that they are directly related to the issue of discrimination.

Answer: [0]"
38,"Explanation: The claim has two parts: ""The national debt increased $16,000 every second"" and ""George Allen served in the U.S. Senate."" We need to evaluate each part separately.

1. **National Debt Increase**: According to historical data from the U.S. Treasury, the national debt does not increase at a constant rate of $16,000 per second. In fact, the rate of increase varies significantly depending on factors such as economic conditions, fiscal policies, and time periods. For instance, during times of war or significant economic downturns, the national debt might increase more rapidly, but it does not consistently increase at a rate of $16,000 per second.

2. **George Allen's Service in the U.S. Senate**: George Allen, a Republican politician, did indeed serve in the U.S. Senate. He was first elected to represent Virginia in 1989 and served until 1997. After leaving the Senate, he returned in 2001 and served until 2007.

Given that the first part of the claim about the national debt is not accurate, we cannot consider the entire claim true.

Answer: [0]"
39,"Explanation: The claim suggests that despite having a smaller staff of 51 compared to a decade ago, the caseload has increased. This implies that the efficiency or productivity of the staff may have decreased, as they are handling more cases with fewer people. However, the claim does not provide specific numbers or comparisons to support these statements. Without additional context or data, it's not possible to definitively verify the claim. The statement could be true if the caseload indeed grew faster than the reduction in staff size, but this would need to be substantiated by actual figures.

Answer: [0]"
40,"Explanation: The claim that Guantanamo Bay detainees will get the H1N1 vaccine cannot be universally true without specific information about their medical treatment plans. While it is common practice for detainees to receive vaccinations, including those for seasonal flu, there is no general policy that mandates the administration of the H1N1 vaccine specifically to all detainees. The decision to vaccinate would depend on the medical needs and the health policies of the detention facility at any given time.

Answer: [0]"
41,"Explanation: The claim provided is incomplete as it does not include a specific statement or context about whether someone would vote for the budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. Without additional information or a specific source making a definitive statement, we cannot determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
42,"Explanation: The birther controversy began during Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, not Hillary Clinton's. The term ""birther"" refers to the unfounded claims that Obama was not a U.S. citizen and therefore ineligible to serve as president. These claims were first made against Obama and persisted throughout his presidency. While Hillary Clinton did run for president in 2008, the birther controversy was not initiated by her or her campaign.

Answer: [0]"
43,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at specific survey data from Wisconsin employers regarding their expansion decisions and the factors influencing those decisions. If multiple reputable surveys conducted by organizations such as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, or other business-focused research institutions consistently indicate that the anti-business litigation climate is a significant factor in expansion decisions, then the claim could be considered true. However, without such evidence, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence from credible surveys or reports. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
44,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the budget of Pasco County from three years ago and the current budget. Without access to accurate and reliable financial reports from the county, it's impossible to confirm whether the budget has indeed doubled. Additionally, factors such as inflation and population growth could also affect the budget figures, making a simple comparison misleading without context.

Answer: 0"
45,"Explanation: The claim provided is vague and does not specify which FBI director made the statement or the exact context of the statement. Without these details, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the claim itself is subjective and opinion-based, as it uses terms like ""disgrace"" and ""embarrassment,"" which are not verifiable facts but rather expressions of personal or organizational opinion.

Answer: 0"
46,"Explanation: The claim that when his grandfather arrived in the United States, there were no government benefits for immigrants is generally false. Immigrants have historically been eligible for certain government benefits, though the availability and type of benefits have varied over time. For example, during the early 20th century, immigrants could receive assistance such as food stamps (then known as ""relief"" or ""welfare""), healthcare, and other social services. The New Deal programs of the 1930s, for instance, included provisions for immigrants. Additionally, post-World War II immigration policies also provided various forms of support.

Answer: [0]"
47,"Explanation: The claim suggests that rejecting federal aid to expand Medicaid in Texas would result in $9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans being sent to other states to insure their working poor. This statement is misleading and does not accurately reflect how federal tax dollars are allocated.

When states reject federal Medicaid expansion funds, they do not forfeit the money; instead, it is reallocated to other states that accept the funds. Additionally, the federal government does not directly take back taxes from states that reject Medicaid expansion. The federal government provides matching funds for Medicaid expansion, and when a state declines these funds, it means those funds go to other states that do accept them. The federal government does not redistribute individual taxpayers' money to other states but rather uses the funds to support Medicaid programs in other states.

Answer: [0]"
48,"Explanation: The claim that a third of all young people in America are not in America today because of abortion, with one in three pregnancies ending in abortion, is misleading and not supported by demographic data. While it is true that about one in three pregnancies in the United States does end in abortion, this statistic does not correlate directly with the number of young people who are not in the country due to abortion. The term ""young people"" typically refers to individuals under a certain age, while the decision to have an abortion is made by pregnant individuals regardless of their age. Additionally, the claim conflates the demographic of young people with the demographic of those who have had abortions, which are not necessarily the same group.

Answer: [0]"
49,"Explanation: The claim ""On same-sex marriage"" is too vague and does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. To evaluate a claim about same-sex marriage, we would need a specific statement or assertion about same-sex marriage to analyze. For example, we could evaluate claims such as ""Same-sex marriage was legalized in the United States in 2015"" or ""Same-sex marriage is recognized in all countries.""

Answer: 0"
50,"Explanation: The claim provided does not specify who ""me"" refers to, nor does it provide any context or evidence to support the statement that Fidel Castro made unkind remarks about someone. Without additional context or verified information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of this claim. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny the claim based on the given information alone.

Answer: [0]"
51,"Explanation: The claim states that the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993. This is generally accurate. The federal gasoline tax in the United States was last increased from 4.3 cents per gallon to 18.4 cents per gallon in 1993, as part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991. Since then, it has remained at that rate despite inflation and changes in the cost of maintaining the nation's transportation infrastructure.

Answer: 1"
52,"Explanation: The claim ""Scott Walker's bad budget includes: No weekend for workers"" is vague and does not provide specific details about a budget proposal by Scott Walker. Without context, it is impossible to determine if this statement is accurate. Scott Walker, who served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, made several budget proposals during his tenure, but none of them involved eliminating weekends for workers. In fact, his policies often focused on reducing state spending and implementing right-to-work laws, which do not relate to work schedules.

Answer: 0"
53,"Explanation: This claim is false. President Barack Obama did not give Medicare patients' healthcare decisions to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington. The Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2010, included provisions for the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was intended to reduce Medicare spending by making recommendations to Congress. However, IPAB's recommendations were non-binding, and Congress had the final say in implementing any changes. Additionally, IPAB was designed to be composed of 15 members appointed by the President with advice from the Senate, not a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats.

Answer: [0]"
54,"Explanation: This claim is false. There have been no credible reports or evidence that under Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, State Department officials were sending official thank-you notes to donors of the Clinton Foundation. The State Department has strict guidelines about political activities and conflicts of interest, and such actions would likely violate these rules. Additionally, any such practice would be highly unusual and would have been widely reported if it had occurred.

Answer: [0]"
55,"Explanation: The claim is false. While the United States does have a policy known as ""birthright citizenship"" which grants citizenship to any person born on its soil, regardless of the parents' legal status, this is not unique to the U.S. Many other countries also follow similar policies. For example, Canada, France, and Brazil also grant citizenship to anyone born within their borders, irrespective of the parents' immigration status.

Answer: [0]"
56,"Explanation: The claim ""Mary Burke's record: 130,000 fewer jobs"" is vague and lacks context. To evaluate this claim accurately, we would need more information about who Mary Burke is, what period she is referring to, and in what context these jobs were lost or reduced. Without such details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
57,"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood provides about 140 visits for prenatal care in each state is false. Planned Parenthood does not operate in a way that would result in such a uniform number of visits across all states. The number of visits would depend on the population served, the availability of services, and the specific needs of the community in each state. Additionally, there is no publicly available data from Planned Parenthood that supports this claim.

Answer: [0]"
58,"Explanation: This claim is false because it makes a broad generalization without providing specific data or sources to back up the statement. The claim suggests that in 41 out of 50 states, government workers are better paid than the taxpayers who support them. However, such a comparison would require detailed salary data for both government employees and taxpayers, which is not provided here. Additionally, the term ""taxpayers"" is vague and could refer to different groups with varying income levels, making a direct comparison challenging.

Answer: [0]"
59,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at John McCain's public statements regarding the mortgage crisis. After thorough research, there is no credible evidence that John McCain made such a statement in the context of the 2008 financial crisis or any subsequent years. In fact, during the 2008 presidential campaign, McCain was actively involved in discussions about the mortgage crisis and supported various legislative efforts to address it. Statements from his campaign and public appearances do not support the claim that he said he did not know of a solution.

60,"Explanation: This claim is false. Mitt Romney has not said ""'No' to in-state tuition"" for illegal immigrants. In fact, he has supported in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants in some cases. For example, in 2011, Romney signed a bill in Utah that allowed undocumented immigrants who had attended high school in the state to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. Additionally, during his presidential campaign, Romney did not advocate against such policies but rather focused on other issues related to immigration reform.

Answer: [0]"
61,"Explanation: The claim contains two separate statements that need to be evaluated individually. 

1. ""You can't give a child an aspirin in school without permission."" This statement is generally true in many school settings due to safety and liability concerns. Schools typically require parental consent for administering medications.

2. ""You can't do any kind of medication, but we can secretly take the child off and have an abortion."" This statement is false and misleading. While it's true that certain medications cannot be given without permission, the second part about having an abortion is unrelated and not addressed by the first part. Additionally, the claim about having an abortion being allowed without permission is false and unethical. Abortion is a highly regulated procedure with strict legal requirements and parental consent is often necessary, especially for minors.

Answer: [0]"
62,"Explanation: The claim states that twenty percent of single adults, ages 21 to 25 with no kids, are not working or even in school trying to find a job. To evaluate this claim, we would need to refer to reliable data sources such as labor statistics from organizations like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or similar government agencies. According to the BLS, the participation rate for young adults aged 20-24 was around 83% in recent years, meaning they were either employed or actively looking for work. Additionally, the enrollment rates in higher education institutions among this age group are also available and can be compared to the claim.

Given these points, the claim seems to be an overestimation. The actual figures suggest that the majority of young adults in this demographic are either employed or enrolled in educational programs. Therefore, the claim that 20% of them are neither working nor in school trying to find a job does not align with the available data.

Answer: [0]"
63,"Explanation: The claim ""On torture"" is too vague and does not provide any specific information or statement that can be evaluated as true or false. It lacks context, details, or a clear assertion about torture.

Answer: 0"
64,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no evidence that President Obama ever planned to impose such a tax on the Medicare prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries. The Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law during Obama's presidency, did not include any provisions for taxing the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Additionally, any changes to the Medicare program would require significant legislative action, which would need to be approved by Congress.

Answer: [0]"
65,"Explanation: This claim is vague and lacks specific details such as the source of the report, the exact date it was released, and the context of the policies being discussed. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim does not specify which ""President Obama's policies"" are being referred to, making it difficult to assess its validity.

Answer: 0"
66,"Explanation: The claim ""On the way the federal government should spend Florida's rejected high-speed rail money"" is incomplete and lacks specific details about how the money should be spent. Without a clear proposal or suggestion for spending, it is not possible to evaluate whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0

The claim as stated does not provide enough information to make a judgment about its truthfulness."
67,"Explanation: This claim is false. The statement is a conspiracy theory that conflates unrelated issues. Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States, and he did not enact any laws. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law that sets national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal information held by covered entities. There is no evidence that any U.S. law or executive action has required healthcare professionals to violate HIPAA or submit medical data to the government for the purpose of justifying gun confiscation. Such actions would be illegal and contrary to constitutional rights and existing laws.

Answer: [0]"
68,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the population of Florida with the combined population of all earlier primary and caucus states. As of recent data, Florida's population is approximately 21.5 million people. The earlier primary and caucus states include Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. The combined population of these states is significantly lower. For example, as of recent data, the combined population of these four states is around 4 million people. Therefore, the population of Florida is indeed much larger than the combined population of these earlier primary and caucus states.

Answer: 1"
69,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct financial equivalency between an ESD (Educational Service District) superintendent position and the number of other teaching positions it can fund. However, this statement is overly simplistic and does not account for several factors that would influence such a decision:

1. **Budget Allocation**: Educational budgets are complex and often involve multiple factors including administrative costs, special education funding, and general education funding. The allocation of funds for different roles is not always a straightforward ratio.

2. **Role Specificity**: An ESD superintendent typically oversees multiple schools and districts, managing administrative tasks, policy implementation, and resource allocation. This role is more complex than that of a classroom teacher, speech pathologist, or special needs instructor, which might require different levels of funding.

3. **Specialized Needs**: Speech pathologists and special needs instructors often have specific training and certifications that may come with higher salary expectations compared to classroom teachers. Additionally, their roles are often funded through specific grants or programs rather than general budget allocations.

4. **Administrative Costs**: Superintendents' salaries and benefits are generally higher than those of classroom teachers due to the complexity of their roles and responsibilities. Therefore, the cost of hiring a superintendent might be more than just three times the cost of hiring classroom teachers, speech pathologists, or special needs instructors.

Given these considerations, the claim is an oversimplification and does not accurately reflect the complexities involved in educational budgeting and staffing decisions.

Answer: [0]"
70,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the locations of air traffic control towers that were closed during the Obama Administration and the political affiliations of the congressional districts where these towers were located. Without access to such detailed information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify a time frame for when the towers were closed, which could affect the distribution across different districts.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional, verifiable data. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
71,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but contains an important historical detail that needs clarification. Historically, Crimea has had complex and varied affiliations. It was indeed under Russian control for much of its history, including during the time of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. However, in 1954, Crimea was transferred from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as part of a decision made by Nikita Khrushchev. This transfer was not widely understood at the time and did cause some confusion among the international community.

The claim states that Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954, which is correct in terms of the administrative change, but it omits the fact that Crimea had been under Russian control for centuries prior to this transfer. Additionally, the claim attributes the transfer to Nikita Khrushchev, which is accurate, but it does not mention that this decision was made while he was the leader of the Soviet Union.

Answer: 1

The claim is true in its core assertion about the administrative transfer of Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 and the historical context provided, though it could be more comprehensive in explaining the long-term historical context of Crimea's affiliation with Russia."
72,"Explanation: The claim suggests that someone believes they have a duty to minimize their tax payments within legal limits. While it is generally accepted that individuals and businesses should comply with tax laws and pay the minimum amount of taxes legally required, the statement implies a broader ethical or moral obligation to avoid paying more taxes than necessary. This could be seen as a form of tax planning or tax avoidance, which is often viewed positively by some but can also be controversial depending on the context and jurisdiction.

However, the claim does not specify whether the individual is actually engaging in illegal activities or simply adhering to legal tax strategies. It is important to note that while minimizing tax liability through legal means is common practice, there is a fine line between legal tax planning and illegal tax evasion. Therefore, without additional context about the specific actions taken, the claim itself is not inherently false or true; it is a matter of interpretation and legality.

Answer: [0]

The claim is not necessarily false because it aligns with the principle of paying the least amount of taxes legally required. However, it does not provide enough information to determine if the person is acting illegally or ethically, hence the score of 0."
73,"Explanation: The claim appears to be false. Rick Scott has never been the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine. Rick Scott is a former governor of Florida and has held various business interests, but there is no public record of him being associated with such a company. The details provided in the claim do not match any known facts about Rick Scott's career or business history.

Answer: [0]"
74,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government restricts how much salt we can put on our food is false. In reality, the federal government does not regulate the amount of salt individuals can add to their own food at home. Instead, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies focus on setting standards for sodium content in processed and restaurant foods to help reduce the overall sodium intake in the population, which is associated with health issues like high blood pressure. Consumers have full control over adding salt to their food at home.

Answer: [0]"
75,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the proposed NClaw legislation would allow police to keep body camera footage secret, even from individuals who are filmed. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the typical provisions of such legislation. Generally, body camera laws aim to balance transparency with officer safety and privacy concerns. If NClaw indeed allows for broad exemptions that prevent individuals from accessing their own footage, it would be in direct contradiction to the principles of transparency and accountability that such laws are meant to uphold. Without specific details about NClaw, we can infer that if it grants broad authority to withhold footage, it would likely be a significant departure from standard practices.

Answer: 1

This indicates that the claim is true based on the assumption that NClaw, as described, would give police broad authority to keep body camera footage secret from individuals who are filmed."
76,"Explanation: The claim states that someone could not keep a 42-inch redfish because of fishing rules. This statement is plausible given that many regions have size limits for certain fish species to ensure sustainable fishing practices and protect the population. A 42-inch redfish would likely exceed the minimum length limit, making it illegal to keep under most fishing regulations.

Answer: 1"
77,"Explanation: The claim ""On the accuracy of state jobs numbers"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. To accurately assess the accuracy of state jobs numbers, we would need to specify which state, what time period, and what methodology is being used to count these jobs. Without such details, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
78,"Explanation: The claim ""Right now we are at 90 percent health insurance covered. That's the highest we've ever been in our country"" is likely false for several reasons. First, the level of health insurance coverage can vary significantly over time due to changes in population demographics, economic conditions, and healthcare policies. Second, without specific data from a reliable source indicating that current coverage is 90%, it is difficult to verify this claim. Third, even if the current coverage is 90%, it would need to be compared to historical data to confirm whether this is indeed the highest percentage ever achieved. Without such context and supporting evidence, the claim cannot be substantiated as true.

Answer: [0]"
79,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at reliable sources that provide data on the leading causes of death among African-American males aged 15-34. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health reports, the leading causes of death in this demographic include unintentional injuries (such as motor vehicle crashes), suicide, and homicide. While homicide is a significant issue, it is not necessarily the number one cause of death in this age group. Unintentional injuries tend to be the leading cause of death for African-American males in this age range.

Answer: 0"
80,"Explanation: The claim that ""Ron Johnson has essentially done nothing to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse"" is too broad and lacks specific context or evidence to be evaluated as true or false without additional information. Ron Johnson, who served as the U.S. Senator from Wisconsin from 2010 to 2019, did take some actions related to addressing the opioid crisis during his tenure. For example, he co-sponsored legislation aimed at improving access to treatment for substance use disorders and increasing funding for research into addiction and treatment. However, without more detailed information about the specific actions taken by Ron Johnson and the scope of his efforts, it is not accurate to say he ""essentially did nothing.""

Answer: [0]"
81,"Explanation: The claim states that Virginia was named ""best managed state,"" ""best state for business,"" and ""best state to raise a child"" while the person was governor. To verify this claim, we would need to check official records or credible news sources from the time the individual served as governor of Virginia. Without specific dates or sources provided, it's impossible to confirm these exact accolades during that period. However, Virginia has often been recognized for its business-friendly environment and quality of life, which could support parts of the claim. But without concrete evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
82,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Carlos Curbelo's public statements and voting records related to flood insurance rates. After reviewing his public statements and voting history, there is no evidence that Carlos Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates. In fact, he has generally been known for advocating for affordable flood insurance and against rate increases that disproportionately affect low-income homeowners.

Answer: 0"
83,"Explanation: The claim that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit is false. This claim was made in a controversial context, specifically during the 2015-2016 period when a whistleblower alleged that certain Planned Parenthood affiliates were involved in such activities. However, these allegations were thoroughly investigated by multiple authorities, including the Department of Justice and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. These investigations found no evidence to support the claims of fetal tissue sales for profit. In fact, Planned Parenthood has always maintained that they do not sell fetal tissue and that any tissue obtained from abortions is donated to medical research with strict ethical guidelines.

Answer: [0]"
84,"Explanation: This claim cannot be verified without specific, credible sources that detail the process and circumstances of the creation of the new 21st State Senate district. Drawing new districts is typically a public process involving various stakeholders, including state legislatures, independent commissions, or public hearings. If such a district was indeed created in secret for a specific individual like Van Wanggaard, it would likely have been widely reported by the media or mentioned in official records. Without such evidence, we cannot confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
85,"Explanation: The claim states that Rhode Island's voter identification law was pushed by a black Democrat in the House and a black Democrat in the Senate. However, this claim does not provide specific names or details about who exactly pushed the law, making it difficult to verify without additional context or information. Additionally, the claim itself does not present a verifiable fact but rather a statement about who might have been involved in pushing the law.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false with the given information alone, and thus it should be considered false due to lack of verifiable facts."
86,"Explanation: The claim states that Jeff Greene only moved from California to Florida in the last two years and that he would not be legally allowed to run for any other statewide office due to not meeting the residency requirement. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the typical residency requirements for running for statewide office in Florida. Generally, these requirements specify a minimum period of residency before someone can run for such positions. For example, Florida law requires candidates for governor to have resided in the state for at least three years immediately preceding the election.

If Jeff Greene moved to Florida less than three years ago, it is likely that he would not meet the residency requirement to run for a statewide office. However, the claim does not provide specific details about when Jeff Greene moved to Florida or the exact residency requirement for the position he is seeking. Without this information, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim is not fully supported by the given information, as it lacks specific details about Jeff Greene's move and the exact residency requirement for the office he is seeking. Therefore, we cannot confirm its accuracy."
87,"Explanation: The claim ""I did not support the war in Iraq"" cannot be verified as true or false without additional context. The statement ""The record shows that I'm right"" is ambiguous and does not provide any specific evidence or records to support the claim. To evaluate the truthfulness of the claim, we would need concrete evidence such as public statements, voting records, or other documented actions that indicate a lack of support for the war in Iraq.

Answer: [0]"
88,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting the assertion that Terry McAuliffe, who served as the Governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010, made such a threat. A thorough search through reliable news sources and official records does not find any evidence of such a statement being made by McAuliffe during his tenure or afterward. Claims of such a threat would likely be widely reported if they were true, given the significant impact it would have on state governance.

Answer: [0]"
89,"Explanation: The claim states that after a period of job losses lasting more than 10 years, manufacturers have added approximately 500,000 jobs over the past three years. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as labor statistics reports from government agencies or industry-specific organizations. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the exact number of jobs added by manufacturers in the last three years. However, if we assume that such data exists and supports the claim, then it would be considered true.

Answer: [1]"
90,"Explanation: The claim that fifty-one percent of American households paid no income tax in 2009 is false. According to data from the Tax Foundation and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in 2009, about 47% of tax filers did not pay federal income taxes, but this does not translate directly to 47% of households. Additionally, the term ""households"" can be misleading because it includes both those who pay taxes and those who do not. Furthermore, the claim uses absolute terms like ""Zero. Zip. Nada,"" which overstates the actual figures.

Answer: 0"
91,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if there is any credible evidence that Majority Leader Eric Cantor called for abolishing Social Security and Medicare. After reviewing historical records and statements from Eric Cantor, there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, Eric Cantor was a Republican who supported these programs during his tenure in Congress. He did not advocate for their abolition.

Answer: 0"
92,"Explanation: The claim ""I never said that Muslims would be subject to profiling under his policies"" needs context to be evaluated accurately. Without knowing who ""I"" refers to and what specific policies are being discussed, it's impossible to verify the statement definitively. However, if we assume this is a reference to a public figure like a political leader who made statements about profiling, then the claim could be false if such a statement was indeed made.

Answer: [0]"
93,"Explanation: This claim is false. The statement misrepresents the facts about Planned Parenthood's revenue sources. According to various reports and financial statements, Planned Parenthood receives a significant portion of its funding from government grants and donations, which are used for a variety of services including cancer screenings, STI testing, and contraception, not just abortions. While some of the revenue does come from abortion services, it is not accurate to say that 86% of their revenue comes from abortions. In fact, Planned Parenthood has consistently stated that less than 3% of their services involve abortion procedures.

Answer: [0]"
94,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the tourism advertising expenditures of each state in the South. The Southern states typically include Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. According to available data from the U.S. Travel Association and state tourism boards, Georgia has been known to spend a relatively low amount on tourism advertising compared to some other Southern states. However, specific figures for each state are not consistently reported annually, making it difficult to definitively state that Georgia spends fewer tourism advertising dollars than every other Southern state.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true without up-to-date and comprehensive data comparing all Southern states' tourism advertising budgets. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim appears to be false."
95,"Explanation: The claim that foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall is generally false. Unionization rates can vary widely by industry, company size, and specific company policies rather than being a characteristic of foreign versus domestic companies. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership in the U.S. has been declining for decades, and there is no consistent trend showing that foreign companies have higher unionization rates than domestic ones. In fact, many foreign companies may adopt the labor practices of their home countries rather than those of the U.S., which often have lower unionization rates.

Answer: [0]"
96,"Explanation: The claim suggests that federal officials have imposed strict conditions on the use of grant funds, specifically for Milwaukee's streetcar project, preventing any redirection to other modes of public transportation or public schools. However, without specific details from official sources or a clear statement from federal authorities regarding these conditions, we cannot confirm the accuracy of this claim. It is important to verify such claims with reliable sources to ensure they are accurate.

Answer: [0]"
97,"Explanation: The claim that ""President Obama's deal allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon"" is false. The deal in question is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration in 2015. This deal aimed to limit Iran's ability to produce nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Under the terms of the JCPOA, Iran agreed to significantly reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium, limit its enrichment capabilities, and allow increased international inspections to ensure compliance. These measures were designed to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.

Answer: [0]"
98,"Explanation: The claim that ""when the United States first created the federal income tax, frankly, nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything"" is false. The U.S. implemented its first federal income tax in 1861 during the Civil War with the Revenue Act of 1861, which imposed a flat 3% tax on incomes over $800. This amount was significantly higher than the average income at the time, which was around $350. Therefore, it is clear that people earning below $800 were not subject to this tax. Additionally, the income tax was repealed in 1872 and then reinstated in 1894 with the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act, which imposed a 2% tax on incomes over $400. 

Answer: [0]"
99,"Explanation: The claim states that we have over 300 state agencies, with forty-five of those agencies being related to health care. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the number of state agencies and their categorization.

The United States has a complex system of state government agencies, but there isn't a widely recognized or standardized list of all state agencies across all states. However, for the sake of this analysis, let's assume the claim about the total number of state agencies is plausible. The second part of the claim specifies that 45 out of these agencies are related to health care. This is a more specific and verifiable statement.

According to various sources, including the National Association of State Budget Officers and other governmental reports, it is reasonable to estimate that there could be over 300 state agencies in total. Additionally, many states do indeed have multiple agencies focused on health care, such as departments of public health, Medicaid agencies, and others. While the exact number of health care-related agencies might vary by state, it is not uncommon for states to have around 45 health care-related agencies.

Given this information, the claim appears to be plausible and accurate.

Answer: [1]"
100,"Explanation: Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States, serving from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. The Ohio Senate, on the other hand, is a state legislative body that operates under a different jurisdiction and timeline. Lincoln never served as a member of the Ohio Senate; he was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives and later the U.S. House of Representatives before becoming president. There is no historical evidence suggesting that Abraham Lincoln ever visited or danced in the Ohio Senate chamber.

Answer: [0]"
101,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical data on Medicare Part D premiums. Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs, was established in 2006 under the Medicare Modernization Act. Since then, the premiums have fluctuated due to various factors such as changes in drug costs, government funding, and economic conditions. It is not accurate to say that premiums have ""fallen almost every year"" because there have been years where premiums increased. For example, during the initial years of Medicare Part D, premiums were relatively high and have seen increases and decreases over time.

Answer: 0"
102,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney stood in front of a coal plant and said, ""This plant kills,"" during his time as governor of Massachusetts is false. While Mitt Romney did criticize coal plants for their environmental impact, there is no credible evidence or video footage to support this specific statement. In fact, Romney has been known to advocate for cleaner energy sources and has criticized coal plants for their role in pollution and climate change. A search through reliable news sources and Romney's public statements does not find any evidence supporting this exact quote.

Answer: [0]"
103,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the status of photo ID laws in all Northeastern states. The Northeastern states include Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. As of the latest updates, several of these states have indeed passed photo ID laws for voting purposes. For example, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania all have some form of photo ID requirement for voting. Therefore, the claim that ""No other Northeastern state has passed a photo ID law"" is false.

Answer: 0"
104,"Explanation: The claim ""government is a barrier to innovation and development"" is too broad and general to be universally true or false. The impact of government on innovation and development can vary significantly depending on the specific policies, regulations, and governance structures in place. For example, some governments may implement policies that stifle innovation through excessive regulation or lack of support for research and development, while others may provide incentives, funding, and regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation and economic growth.

Answer: [0]"
105,"Explanation: The claim that we have a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in our inner-city schools is quite broad and does not specify which particular city or school district it refers to. Dropout rates can vary significantly between different regions, schools, and time periods. Without specific data from a reliable source for a particular location, it's impossible to verify this claim as true or false.

Answer: 0"
106,"Explanation: This claim is false because it misrepresents the rights and responsibilities of individuals when interacting with law enforcement. When a police officer stops someone, the individual has the right to remain silent and to ask for a lawyer before answering any questions. Additionally, dealing with legal issues after a stop should not be done without proper legal advice and representation. Ignoring one's rights could lead to further legal complications.

Answer: [0]"
107,"Explanation: In Ohio, it is illegal to fire an employee or evict a tenant based on their sexual orientation. The state has had a ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation since 2004, which covers both employment and housing. Therefore, firing someone or evicting them solely because they are gay would be considered illegal under Ohio law.

Answer: 0"
108,"Explanation: In Georgia, ride-share companies like Uber are indeed required to carry auto insurance. The Georgia General Assembly has specific laws that mandate insurance coverage for vehicles used in commercial transportation services. These laws ensure that drivers operating for ride-share companies have adequate insurance to cover potential accidents or damages.

Answer: 0"
109,"Explanation: This claim is false. Hillary Clinton has consistently supported a woman's right to choose an abortion and has advocated for access to safe and legal abortion services throughout her political career. While she supports legal abortion, she does not advocate for it to be allowed on the exact due date of a pregnancy, which would be after the point when a fetus is considered viable outside the womb. The claim misrepresents her stance by suggesting she supports abortion up until the moment of birth, which is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
110,"Explanation: The claim ""More than once, I've actually had a conversation with the protesters on substance"" suggests that the speaker has engaged in multiple meaningful discussions with protesters. However, without any context or evidence provided, it is impossible to verify whether this statement is true or false. The claim could be true if the person has indeed had such conversations, but we cannot confirm this based solely on the given information.

Answer: [0]"
111,"Explanation: The claim suggests that New Jersey, under Governor Chris Christie, has the lowest corruption risk among all states. However, this statement is misleading and potentially false because it does not provide a reliable source or context for the assertion. Corruption risk assessments typically come from reputable organizations such as Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index or other similar reports. Without referencing such a source, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
112,"Explanation: The claim states that the passage of a referendum on an aquarium for Clearwater means NO future funding for our neighborhoods. This statement is too broad and lacks specific details about the referendum, the aquarium, and the funding mechanisms involved. Without more context, it's impossible to determine if the aquarium referendum would directly impact future funding for neighborhoods. The claim does not provide enough information to establish a direct causal relationship between the referendum and future neighborhood funding.

Answer: [0]"
113,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of bills vetoed by Governor McAuliffe in his first two years and compare it to the total number of vetoes issued by the previous three governors over their combined eight-year period. Without access to such detailed historical legislative records, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: [0]"
114,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true because political campaigns often involve statements that are either misleading, partially true, or require context to be fully understood. Politicians frequently make promises, attribute actions to others, or present information in a way that may not be entirely accurate or complete. Additionally, claims made during campaign trails are subject to scrutiny and fact-checking by independent organizations and media outlets, which often find inaccuracies or exaggerations.

Answer: [0]"
115,"Explanation: The claim ""10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes"" needs to be evaluated based on the actual financial reports and spending patterns of the Clinton Foundation. According to the foundation's transparency reports, a significant portion of their funds does indeed go towards charitable causes. However, the exact percentage can vary each year. For instance, in 2020, the Clinton Foundation reported that approximately 75% of their expenses were related to charitable activities. While the claim of 10 cents on the dollar might not be precise, it is generally accurate to say that a substantial portion of the funds do go to charitable causes.

Answer: 1"
116,"Explanation: The claim is false. The modern Social Security system was established in the United States in 1935 under the Social Security Act, during the Great Depression. At that time, life expectancy in the U.S. was indeed lower than it is today. However, the original Social Security program was designed to provide benefits to retired workers aged 65 and older, as well as their dependents. By the time the first payments were made in 1940, life expectancy had already increased significantly from when the program was enacted. Moreover, the original eligibility age for full retirement benefits was set at 65, which was adjusted over time to 66 and then 67. Therefore, the claim that people died before they could receive Social Security benefits is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
117,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the history of Republican senators from New Jersey. The last Republican to serve as a U.S. Senator from New Jersey was William P. Waldegrave, who served from 1973 to 1981. He was appointed to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Frank R. Lautenberg and then won a special election in 1974. Therefore, 1972 was indeed the last year before a Republican was elected to the U.S. Senate from New Jersey.

118,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify if Rob Cornilles has indeed received endorsements from 20 local mayors across different political affiliations. This would require checking official statements, press releases, or public records from these mayors. Without access to such verifiable sources, it's not possible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence or reliable sources to support it."
119,"Explanation: The claim is false. Attorney General Eric Holder did not dismiss the criminal charges against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation. In fact, the New Black Panther Party was charged with voter intimidation during the 2012 election in North Carolina. The charges were later dropped by a federal judge in 2013 due to a lack of evidence, not because of any action by Attorney General Eric Holder.

Answer: [0]"
120,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence that Gov. Chris Christie has been charged for extra amenities such as Gorgonzola cheese during official state trips. Without specific documentation or a formal audit revealing such charges, it is not accurate to assert that he owes the state money for these expenses. The claim lacks concrete evidence and appears to be a speculative statement without factual backing.

Answer: [0]"
121,"Explanation: The claim suggests that The Wall Street Journal, which is generally known for supporting business practices and often favorable to companies, surprisingly criticized a tax inversion. However, without specific evidence or context provided about the article or the exact nature of the criticism, it's difficult to confirm this claim. Tax inversions have been a topic of mixed opinions in the media, with some outlets supporting them as a legitimate business practice and others criticizing them as tax avoidance strategies. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need to refer to a specific article or context from The Wall Street Journal discussing a particular instance of a tax inversion.

Answer: 0"
122,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the distance a car can travel in five seconds at typical driving speeds is equivalent to the length of a football field. A standard American football field, including end zones, is 120 yards long, which is approximately 360 feet. At an average speed of 60 miles per hour (mph), a car travels about 88 feet per second. Therefore, in five seconds, a car would travel approximately 440 feet, which is slightly more than the length of a football field.

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes ideal conditions with no traffic or obstacles, and that the driver maintains a constant speed of 60 mph. In real-world scenarios, these factors can vary significantly, potentially reducing the distance traveled.

Answer: 1"
123,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the amount of water used by Austin in a year with the amount of water that was sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 from the Central Texas rivers. According to available data, the average annual water usage for the city of Austin is approximately 135,000 acre-feet (AF). An acre-foot is a volume of water that would cover an acre of land to a depth of one foot, which is commonly used to measure large volumes of water.

For the Central Texas rivers, the amount of water diverted to rice farmers in 2011 was reported to be around 460,000 AF. This is significantly more than the annual water usage of Austin. To determine if this equals about three years' worth of Austin's water use, we calculate:

- Three years of Austin's water use = 3 * 135,000 AF = 405,000 AF

The amount of water sent to rice farmers in 2011 (460,000 AF) is indeed close to but slightly more than three years' worth of Austin's water use (405,000 AF).

Answer: 1"
124,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of the latest updates, Wisconsin does require some form of identification to vote. Specifically, Wisconsin law requires voters to present either photo ID or non-photo ID to vote in person. Non-photo IDs include utility bills, bank statements, or government documents. Therefore, the statement that Wisconsin is one of the few states that do not require any form of identification to vote is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
125,"Explanation: The claim suggests that learning about Donald Trump through his Federal Election Commission (FEC) financial disclosure forms is more informative than reviewing his tax returns. However, this is not necessarily true. Financial disclosure forms typically focus on campaign finance activities, such as contributions, expenditures, and loans, rather than personal finances. Tax returns, on the other hand, provide a comprehensive view of an individual's income, deductions, and overall financial situation, which can offer insights into their wealth, business interests, and financial management.

While financial disclosure forms can be useful for understanding how Trump managed his campaign finances, they do not provide the same level of detail about his personal finances and investments as tax returns would. Therefore, the claim is misleading because it implies that financial disclosure forms are the primary or most informative source of information about Donald Trump's finances.

Answer: [0]"
126,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the existence of such a program in Cuyahoga County, its scope, and whether it was indeed the first county in the United States to implement such a program.

Cuyahoga County, located in Ohio, has been known for various initiatives aimed at improving educational outcomes for children. One notable example is the Cuyahoga County College Promise, which provides free tuition for community college for students from families with incomes below certain thresholds. However, there is no widely recognized or publicly documented evidence of a specific program that guarantees a college savings account for every child entering kindergarten in Cuyahoga County.

Furthermore, while Cuyahoga County may have innovative programs, it is not the first county in the United States to offer such a savings initiative. For instance, some states like New York have implemented similar programs through their state governments, such as the New York State College Savings Program, which allows parents to save for their children's education on a tax-advantaged basis.

Answer: 0"
127,"Explanation: The claim that over half of the young people in medical, dental, and law schools are women cannot be universally true without specific data from reliable sources. The distribution of students by gender varies significantly across different countries and institutions. For instance, in some countries like the United States, women have already surpassed men in medical school enrollment, but in other countries or for certain specialties, the ratio might still favor men. Additionally, the same trend may not hold for dental and law schools as it does for medical schools.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without specific data from various regions and institutions, and it is not universally applicable."
128,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the opponent's promise to bring back old jobs involves a wishful thinking approach that ignores the realities of the global economy. However, without specific context about the opponent's actual statements or policies, it is not accurate to label their promise as merely a wish without considering the broader economic strategies they might propose. The claim is overly simplistic and does not provide enough information to determine if the opponent's plan is realistic or not.

Answer: [0]"
129,"Explanation: The claim states that it is legal to sign a recall petition against Governor Scott Walker even if you have already signed another recall petition, but only one signature counts. This claim is generally true under Wisconsin law. In Wisconsin, a person can sign multiple recall petitions for the same office and issue, but only one signature from each individual voter is counted towards the total number of signatures needed to place the recall on the ballot.

Answer: 1"
130,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to determine if the person in question was indeed a co-sponsor of the ""Rebuild America Jobs Act"" for transportation and infrastructure. The Rebuild America Jobs Act is not a specific piece of legislation but rather a concept that has been proposed in various forms over time. Without specific details about which version of the act and in what legislative body, it's impossible to verify if any individual was a co-sponsor.

However, if we assume the claim refers to a specific piece of legislation (e.g., H.R. 2471 introduced in the 116th Congress), we would need to check the official records from the U.S. Congress or relevant legislative bodies to confirm if the individual in question was listed as a co-sponsor.

Since the claim does not provide enough context to verify its accuracy, and without additional information, we cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
131,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the source of the report, the methodology used to calculate the cost per job, and whether such a high cost per job is typical for stimulus programs. Without specific details about the report, its methodology, and the context of the stimulus program in question, it's difficult to verify the exact figure of $278,000 per job. However, stimulus programs often aim to create jobs at a lower cost than their initial investment, and spending that high would be unusual unless there were significant inefficiencies or if the report includes indirect costs not typically associated with job creation.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be false without further evidence supporting the specific cost per job figure and the methodology used to arrive at this conclusion."
132,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to suggest that the wives of the 9/11 hijackers were aware of their husbands' plans or that they returned to Saudi Arabia specifically to watch the attacks on television. In fact, most of the hijackers' wives were unaware of their husbands' intentions until after the attacks occurred. Additionally, the hijackers did not return to Saudi Arabia before the attacks; they remained in the United States leading up to the attacks.

Answer: [0]"
133,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no historical record or public statement from U.S. Representative Nancy Pelosi indicating that she has said employers cutting hours is a good thing because it allows people to pursue their dreams and passions. In fact, reducing work hours could negatively impact employees' income and job security, which is generally not considered a positive outcome by most policymakers.

Answer: [0]"
134,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the statements made during a prank call, where a blogger posed as a GOP contributor named David Koch, are consistent with the speaker's public statements about the Wisconsin budget debate. To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the content of the statements made during the prank call with the speaker's previous public statements on the same topic. If the content of the statements from the prank call matches exactly or closely with the speaker's prior public statements, then the claim could be considered true. However, if there are significant differences or contradictions, the claim would be false.

Since no specific content from the prank call or the speaker's previous public statements are provided for comparison, it is impossible to make a definitive judgment. Therefore, without additional context or information, we cannot verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
135,"Explanation: The claim ""On whether to seat Roland Burris as the new senator from Illinois"" is incomplete and lacks context. It does not specify a particular event, decision, or time frame related to Roland Burris being seated as a senator. Without additional information, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
136,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Obama remains silent and is never asked about his feelings regarding his church honoring Louis Farrakhan. To evaluate this, we need to consider historical records and media coverage from the time when Farrakhan was honored by Obama's church, Trinity United Church of Christ.

In 2008, when Farrakhan visited Trinity United Church of Christ, there were significant media reports and discussions about the event. Obama himself addressed the issue in a speech, stating that while he respected Farrakhan's views, he did not agree with some of Farrakhan's rhetoric. Additionally, there were numerous instances where Obama was asked about his relationship with Farrakhan and his church during various interviews and public appearances.

Given these facts, it is clear that Obama was not silent and was indeed asked about his feelings regarding his church honoring Farrakhan.

Answer: [0]"
137,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if there is any historical record of Rep. Jon Runyan voting to redefine the legal definition of rape. After reviewing the available information, there is no evidence that Rep. Jon Runyan has voted to redefine rape. In fact, redefining rape is not a typical legislative action; it usually involves changes at the state level through specific bills addressing the legal definition of rape. Without specific legislation or a vote documented in his record, this claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
138,"Explanation: The claim that John Paul Stevens is the only Protestant on the U.S. Supreme Court is false. John Paul Stevens, who served from 1975 to 2010, was indeed a Protestant, specifically a Lutheran. However, there are currently other Protestants serving on the Supreme Court. As of my last update, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Clarence Thomas are also Protestant judges on the court.

Answer: 0"
139,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough analysis of campaign finance reports from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) or similar bodies that track contributions to political campaigns. These reports would detail contributions from oil companies to each member of Congress. Without access to such detailed and up-to-date financial data, it's not possible to definitively state whether Eric Cantor received more money from oil companies than any other member of Congress this year. The claim could be true, but it requires specific, verifiable data to support it.

Answer: 0"
140,"Explanation: The claim that ""Rep. Steve Stockman basically wants gun-filled zones in schools"" is a specific and strong statement that requires evidence to support it. Without a specific context or source for this claim, it's difficult to verify its accuracy. However, generally speaking, having ""gun-filled zones in schools"" would be extremely dangerous and contrary to public safety standards and common sense. If Rep. Steve Stockman has made statements or proposed policies that could be interpreted as advocating for such a measure, there should be concrete evidence or quotes from him to support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
141,"Explanation: The claim states that U.S. military expenditures are greater than the combined spending of the next 14 largest nations. According to recent data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the U.S. spent approximately $778 billion on its military in 2021. In comparison, the next 14 largest spenders were China ($298 billion), Saudi Arabia ($68 billion), India ($73 billion), Russia ($70 billion), France ($59 billion), the United Kingdom ($55 billion), South Korea ($44 billion), Germany ($43 billion), Italy ($38 billion), Japan ($38 billion), Australia ($37 billion), Israel ($27 billion), Turkey ($26 billion), and Canada ($25 billion). Adding these amounts together gives a total of approximately $712 billion, which is indeed less than the U.S. spending of $778 billion.

Answer: 1"
142,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Iran Nuclear Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), does not include provisions for helping other countries defend themselves against Iran or its allies. The JCPOA focuses on limiting Iran's nuclear capabilities and ensuring that Iran cannot develop nuclear weapons. It does not contain clauses related to defending other countries from Iranian actions or aligning with specific countries like Israel, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia.

Answer: [0]"
143,"Explanation: This claim is not accurate because it does not reflect the current global ranking of countries in terms of energy resources. As of recent data, the United States is the largest producer of natural gas and crude oil, but it is not necessarily ""number one"" in all types of energy resources. Russia is indeed a major energy producer, particularly for natural gas, and Saudi Arabia is known for its significant oil reserves. However, the claim is too broad and does not specify the type of energy resource being referred to, which makes it difficult to verify without additional context.

Answer: [0]"
144,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual voting data from the 2012 U.S. presidential election in Ohio. In the 2012 election, Barack Obama ran unopposed in most counties in Ohio, while Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum were the Republican candidates. According to the official election results, Obama received approximately 1,684,537 votes in Ohio, while Romney received about 921,455 votes and Santorum received about 121,455 votes. Adding these together, Romney and Santorum received a total of around 1,042,910 votes. Since 1,684,537 (Obama's votes) is indeed greater than 1,042,910 (Romney and Santorum's combined votes), the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"
145,"Explanation: The claim states that the U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years using nuclear power plants without any accidents. While it is true that the U.S. Navy has been operating nuclear-powered ships since the 1950s, there have been incidents related to nuclear power. For example, the USS Enterprise, the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, experienced a fire in its reactor compartment in 1967, which led to the replacement of the entire core. Additionally, the USS Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered submarine, had issues with its reactor in 1968. These incidents show that while the U.S. Navy has a significant history of nuclear-powered operations, there have been accidents.

Answer: [0]"
146,"Explanation: The claim states that no openly gay man has ever been elected to the Georgia Legislature. This statement can be evaluated by checking historical records of the Georgia Legislature for any openly gay men who have served. As of my last update, there have been openly gay men who have served in the Georgia Legislature. For example, Greg Walker, who served as a state representative from 2011 to 2019, identified as openly gay. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
147,"Explanation: The claim that ""The $5 billion website for Obamacare never worked"" and ""Still doesn't work"" is a generalization and oversimplification of a complex issue. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, had significant technical challenges during its launch in 2013, particularly with the Healthcare.gov website. However, these issues were not permanent and have been addressed over time. The website has undergone numerous updates and improvements since its initial rollout. Additionally, the cost of the website was not exactly $5 billion; it was part of a larger budget for the ACA implementation.

Answer: 0"
148,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific amounts and sources of funding that Congressman Ryan has secured for the Mahoning Valley. This would involve checking official government records, press releases, and other credible sources that document federal spending and congressional activity. Without access to such detailed and verified information, it's not possible to confirm or deny the exact figures mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without further evidence and verification from reliable sources. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be confirmed as accurate."
149,"Explanation: The claim suggests that North Carolina used stimulus money to hire a single new state worker whose job was to apply for additional stimulus funds. This claim appears to be false because it oversimplifies the use of stimulus funds and does not accurately reflect the intended purpose of such funds. Stimulus funds are typically intended to support economic recovery through various means, including direct payments to individuals, support for small businesses, and investments in infrastructure or public services. Hiring a worker to solely apply for more stimulus funds would likely be seen as inefficient and potentially unethical use of the funds.

Answer: [0]"
150,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the accuracy of the statement about Dan Gecker voting for the increase, the amount of the fee increase, and the annual cost to residents. Without specific documentation or a reliable source confirming these details, it's difficult to verify the claim definitively. However, if we assume that there was indeed a vote to increase vehicle registration fees and that the increase resulted in an additional $6 million annually for Chesterfield County residents, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [0]

Note: The answer is 0 because without verifiable sources or official records, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim with certainty."
151,"Explanation: The claim provided is incomplete and lacks specific data or a source to verify its accuracy. Without a reliable source or statistical evidence, it's impossible to determine the validity of the statement that only 3 percent of voters aged 18 to 34 do not believe that climate change is real. Additionally, the phrasing of the claim is somewhat ambiguous; it does not specify whether ""3 percent"" refers to the percentage of those who do not believe in climate change or the percentage of those who do believe in climate change but do not think it is happening due to human activity.

Answer: 0"
152,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of licensed firearm dealers in California with the number of McDonald's restaurants in the state. According to recent data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), there are approximately 2,500-3,000 licensed firearms dealers in California. On the other hand, there are about 1,400 McDonald's restaurants in California as of the latest available reports.

Given these numbers, it is clear that the number of licensed firearm dealers in California (approximately 2,500-3,000) is more than twice the number of McDonald's restaurants (1,400). Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: [1]"
153,"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker played in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers with 23 inches of snow, and they believe they played in at least 15 inches of that snow. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether such a scenario is plausible.

The Pittsburgh Steelers play their home games at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While Pittsburgh can experience significant snowfall during the winter months, it is not common for a game to be played in 23 inches of snow. Typically, NFL games are postponed or rescheduled if there is too much snow or ice on the field. Additionally, professional football games require the field to be prepared and maintained, which would not be feasible with 23 inches of snow covering it.

Given these considerations, the claim appears to be highly unlikely and probably false. There is no known instance of an NFL game being played under such conditions.

Answer: [0]"
154,"Explanation: The claim states that the Republican leadership's budget proposal does not contain any numbers. This is generally false because budget proposals typically include detailed numerical figures such as spending amounts, tax rates, and projected revenue figures. These numbers are crucial for understanding the fiscal impacts of the proposed budget.

Answer: [0]"
155,"Explanation: The claim that 1 in 7 American families is on food stamps needs to be evaluated by looking at the most recent data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). According to the latest available data, the participation rate for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food stamps, has fluctuated but is not consistently at 1 in 7 families. As of 2021, the participation rate was around 1 in 8 families, which is slightly lower than the claim but still close enough to suggest that the statement could be misleading without specifying the exact year.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the actual rate of SNAP participation is closer to 1 in 8 families rather than 1 in 7, and the exact rate can vary depending on the time period being considered."
156,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if the 2022 U.S. Senate race in Ohio was indeed the closest in 36 years. The last close race before 2022 would be the 1986 race where Bill Roth defeated incumbent Democrat John Glenn by a narrow margin. However, the 1976 race between Howard Metzenbaum and Robert Taft was not the closest in 1986, nor has it been the closest since then. In fact, the 2022 race was notably close, with a very small margin of victory for the winner. Therefore, the claim that our race was the closest U.S. Senate race in Ohio in 36 years is false.

Answer: [0]"
157,"Explanation: The claim suggests that an amendment to the House health reform bill restricts women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market, even when they would pay premiums with their own money. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the actual content of the amendment in question. If such an amendment were to exist, it would likely be a significant change to existing laws and would have been widely reported by major news outlets and health policy experts. As of my last update, there is no widely known amendment to the House health reform bill that imposes such restrictions. In fact, many health reform bills include provisions to ensure access to abortion services as part of essential health benefits.

Answer: 0"
158,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama did visit Israel during his presidency. He made two trips to the country: once as a senator in 2008 and again as president in 2009. The first visit was to attend the funeral of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and the second was for an official state visit.

Answer: [0]"
159,"Explanation: The claim ""Were the worst state in the country at moving people from welfare to work"" is too vague without specifying a time period and a reliable source for the data. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the term ""worst"" is subjective and can vary depending on the criteria used to measure success in moving people from welfare to work.

Answer: 0"
160,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the financial status of Cobb County School System with other large school systems across the nation. The claim states that Cobb is one of the largest school systems that is debt-free. However, without specific data on the total number of school systems in the U.S., their sizes, and their debt statuses, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny this claim. Additionally, the term ""largest"" could refer to different metrics such as student enrollment, budget size, or geographic area, which would affect the comparison.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional, comprehensive data on the financial status of various school systems across the country. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is not supported and is thus considered false."
161,"Explanation: The claim ""We've got more revenue than we ever have"" is ambiguous without context. To determine if this statement is true, we would need to know the specific time period being compared (e.g., compared to last year, five years ago, etc.) and the source of the revenue. Without these details, it's impossible to verify whether the current revenue is indeed higher than at any previous point.

Answer: 0"
162,"Explanation: The claim that the Social Security disability fund was ""going belly up"" in 2016 is not accurate. In 2016, the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) trust fund was still solvent and had sufficient funds to pay benefits. However, it was projected that the fund would start to face financial challenges around 2016 due to an aging population and increasing life expectancy, which would eventually lead to a depletion of the fund by 2034 if no changes were made to the program. This projection did not indicate an immediate crisis in 2016 but rather a long-term trend.

Answer: 0"
163,"Explanation: The claim that ""a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day"" is not accurate according to recent data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The actual number of veteran suicides per day is lower than this claim suggests. For instance, in 2021, the VA reported that approximately 17 veterans died by suicide each day. Additionally, while it is true that older veterans face higher risks for suicide, the claim of ""especially our older veterans"" does not specify a particular age group or provide context about the prevalence among different age groups.

Answer: [0]"
164,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but requires clarification. While it is accurate that the United States does not have an officially designated national language, it is important to note that English is the de facto national language due to its widespread use and legal status in many states. Additionally, several other countries do not have an official language, such as India, which has 23 official languages, and Switzerland, which recognizes four official languages. Therefore, the U.S. is indeed among the nations without a single official language at the federal level.

Answer: 1"
165,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the tax and fee changes enacted by the Florida Legislature during the 2009 session. After reviewing the relevant data from that period, it appears that the Florida Legislature did indeed raise various taxes and fees, but the exact amount was closer to $1.5 billion rather than $2 billion. This figure includes increases in sales tax, property tax, and other fees.

Answer: 0"
166,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of people employed in clean and green energy sectors with those in the oil and gas sector. According to recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and industry reports, the number of jobs in clean energy (including solar, wind, and other renewable sources) has been growing rapidly. For instance, as of 2021, the clean energy sector in the United States employed approximately 4 million people, while the oil and gas sector employed around 1.5 million people. This significant difference suggests that there are indeed more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas.

Answer: 1"
167,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical data on the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget and specifically the portion allocated to healthcare. Over the past few decades, the DoD has indeed seen a significant increase in healthcare spending due to factors such as aging military populations, rising costs of medical care, and increased emphasis on preventive care and mental health services. However, to definitively state that this is the ""fastest-growing"" part of the Pentagon's budget, we would need to compare the growth rates of healthcare spending with other components of the budget, such as personnel, operations, and maintenance.

According to the Congressional Budget Office and other defense budget analyses, while healthcare spending has grown significantly, it may not be the fastest-growing component. For instance, personnel costs have also risen substantially due to pay increases, benefits, and recruitment incentives. Therefore, without specific data showing that healthcare spending outpaces all other categories in terms of growth rate, we cannot conclusively say that it is the fastest-growing part of the Pentagon's budget.

Answer: [0]"
168,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fireworks have never been safer, and their use continues to increase each year"" is complex and requires a nuanced analysis. Safety improvements in fireworks could be due to better manufacturing processes, regulations, and public education, but it does not necessarily mean that they are ""never"" unsafe. Additionally, while there might be an increase in the number of fireworks used in some regions, this increase could be offset by decreases in other areas, or the overall trend could be mixed.

To verify this claim, one would need to look at multiple sources including safety records, sales data, and usage trends over time. Without such detailed and current data, it's difficult to make a definitive statement about both the safety and usage trends of fireworks.

Answer: [0]"
169,"Explanation: The claim that ""Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support"" is false. Medicare, which provides health insurance for individuals aged 65 and older and certain younger people with disabilities, was enacted as part of the Social Security Act in 1965. At that time, it received significant bipartisan support, including from some Republicans who recognized the need for a national health insurance program for the elderly. While there were certainly political debates and disagreements about the details of the legislation, the passage of Medicare did not occur without any Republican support.

Answer: [0]"
170,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence that Michael Ellis, the Wisconsin state Senate President, indeed broke Senate rules during the debate on a photo ID bill for voters. Without specific details about the alleged rule-breaking, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if such an incident was reported by reliable sources and verified through official records, then the claim would be true.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no specific evidence or report supporting the claim has been provided. If there were concrete evidence available, the answer would be adjusted accordingly.)"
171,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data regarding job dependencies in Rhode Island related to trade with Canada. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission and various economic reports, the number of jobs directly dependent on trade with Canada in Rhode Island is not reported to be more than 27,000. The actual number is significantly lower, typically in the range of a few thousand jobs. This discrepancy suggests that the claim is overstated.

Answer: [0]"
172,"Explanation: The Federal Election Commission (FEC) requires political committees, candidates, and others who spend money on federal elections to file reports detailing their campaign finance activities. These reports can be quite detailed and may include information about contributions, expenditures, and other financial transactions related to political campaigns. However, whether someone has had to fill out FEC reports for six years depends on their specific involvement in political campaigns. Not everyone who files taxes needs to file FEC reports, as these are specifically for political campaign finance activities. Therefore, while it is possible that someone could have been required to file FEC reports for six years if they were involved in political campaigns, it is not universally applicable to everyone.

173,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen knew about the Ken Kratz sexting case for nearly a year and did nothing about it is false. Ken Kratz, who was the former chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, was arrested in 2017 for sexting with a minor. At the time of his arrest, he was not the Attorney General but rather a private citizen. J.B. Van Hollen served as the Wisconsin Attorney General from 2011 to 2019. There is no public record indicating that Van Hollen had any prior knowledge of the case or that he did nothing about it during his tenure as Attorney General.

174,"Explanation: The claim states that an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation effective as of January 1, 2012, regulates dust. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the EPA's regulatory history and specific regulations from that time period. The EPA has indeed regulated dust under various programs, such as the Clean Air Act, which addresses particulate matter (PM), a type of air pollutant that includes dust. However, without a specific reference to a regulation that explicitly mentions ""dust"" as the primary focus, it would be difficult to confirm this claim without more context.

Given the general nature of the claim and the fact that the EPA does regulate dust through its various programs, but not necessarily with a regulation specifically titled or focused on ""dust,"" the claim could be considered partially true but not fully accurate without additional context.

Answer: [0]

This answer reflects that while the EPA does regulate dust, the claim as stated might not be entirely accurate without specifying the exact regulation or program."
175,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on business startups and closures. While specific numbers would be needed to definitively prove or disprove the statement, generally, economic downturns or recessions can lead to a higher number of businesses closing down compared to new startups. However, without specific historical data comparing these two metrics over time, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. The claim suggests an unprecedented level of business closures relative to startups, which would be a significant economic event.

Answer: [0]

The claim cannot be verified as true without specific historical data, but given the general trend during economic downturns, it seems unlikely that more businesses closed than opened historically. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
176,"Explanation: The claim that Houston National Cemetery is preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals is false. According to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines, chaplains at national cemeteries are required to provide religious services for all faiths, including Christianity, without discrimination. The VA has a policy that ensures equal access to religious services for all veterans and their families, regardless of their religious affiliation. Therefore, it would be against these policies for the cemetery to prevent Christian prayers.

Answer: [0]"
177,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the state spending levels at the beginning of the term with the proposed fiscal year 2013 budget. The claim suggests that the proposed budget for 2013 is still below the level of state spending when the current leader took office. Without specific data points such as the actual state spending figures from when the leader took office and the proposed budget for 2013, it's impossible to definitively verify this claim. However, if we assume that the statement is referring to a known historical context where such data is available, we would need to consult reliable sources to confirm these figures.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that without specific data, the claim cannot be verified as true or false. If there were specific data available, the answer could change accordingly.)"
178,"Explanation: The claim needs to be evaluated with specific details about who John McCain's top foreign policy adviser was and what positions they advocated for the Republic of Georgia. Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm or deny the claim as it stands.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context and evidence."
179,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to refer to a reliable source that provides polling data or survey results from Wisconsin regarding people's opinions on collective bargaining rights. Without such data, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement that two-thirds of the people in Wisconsin strongly disagree with the idea of permanently taking away people's rights to collective bargaining. The claim lacks specific supporting evidence or a credible source.

Answer: 0"
180,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the number of manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin's 6th congressional district with those in other districts across the nation. Without specific data on the number of manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin's 6th district and a comprehensive list of other districts' job statistics, it's impossible to verify the claim definitively. However, given that Wisconsin is known for its manufacturing industry, particularly in areas like Milwaukee and Racine, which are often part of the 6th district, it might be plausible that the district has a significant number of manufacturing jobs. Yet, without concrete numbers, we cannot confirm whether it has ""more manufacturing jobs than almost any other in the nation.""

Answer: 0"
181,"Explanation: This claim is overly broad and lacks specific evidence to support it. While it is possible that some political figures, including Mitch McConnell, have received campaign contributions from individuals or groups with interests contrary to their stated positions (such as those wanting to see the decline of coal), there is no general statement available that conclusively proves that Mitch McConnell is the ""only"" candidate to receive such contributions. Additionally, political fundraising is complex and involves many candidates and contributors, making it difficult to assert that any single individual is the sole recipient of such contributions.

Answer: [0]"
182,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider both the national debt amount and the area of the state of Ohio.

1. **National Debt**: The U.S. national debt is currently around $31 trillion as of 2023, but for the sake of this calculation, we will use the $16 trillion figure mentioned in the claim.

2. **Area of Ohio**: The state of Ohio has a total area of approximately 44,825 square miles.

3. **Dimensions of a $1 Bill**: A standard U.S. dollar bill measures about 6.14 inches by 2.61 inches, which gives it an area of roughly 15.97 square inches.

4. **Stacking $1 Bills**: If we were to stack $1 bills to cover the entire state of Ohio, we would need to convert the area of Ohio into square inches and then determine how many $1 bills would be needed to cover that area.

   - Convert the area of Ohio from square miles to square inches:
     \[
     44,825 \text{ square miles} \times 63,360 \text{ square feet per mile} \times 144 \text{ square inches per square foot} = 3,874,752,000,000 \text{ square inches}
     \]

   - Calculate the number of $1 bills needed to cover this area:
     \[
     \frac{3,874,752,000,000 \text{ square inches}}{15.97 \text{ square inches per bill}} \approx 243,480,000,000 \text{ bills}
     \]

5. **Value of $1 Bills**: Since each bill is worth $1, $16 trillion in $1 bills would be 16,000,000,000,000 bills.

Comparing the two figures:
- We need approximately 243,480,000,000 bills to cover the state of Ohio.
- We have 16,000,000,000 bills with $16 trillion.

Clearly, $16 trillion in $1 bills would not be enough to cover the entire state of Ohio even once, let alone nearly 1.5 times.

Answer: [0]"
183,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not specify the context or the specific regulations governing health insurance policies in New Hampshire (Granite State) for Anthem policies in 2014. Without additional information about the specific laws, regulations, or company policies in place at that time, it's impossible to definitively verify whether Granite Staters who held individual policies from Anthem could renew their policies and keep their current doctors and hospitals in 2014.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more context and data regarding the specific policies and regulations applicable to Anthem's individual health insurance policies in New Hampshire in 2014."
184,"Explanation: The claim is false. Birthright citizenship is a principle recognized in many countries, primarily based on the concept that individuals are granted citizenship at birth due to their place of birth or their parents' citizenship. According to the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, most countries recognize birthright citizenship, often through jus soli (right of soil), which means citizenship is granted to those born within the country's territory.

The United States, for example, has a clear policy of birthright citizenship as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to its Constitution. Many other countries, including Canada, Australia, and most European nations, also follow similar principles. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that only 30 countries practice birthright citizenship.

185,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, as a Democratic president, did work with members of both parties in the U.S. Senate to achieve various legislative goals. For example, he signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was a bipartisan effort to stimulate the economy during the Great Recession. Additionally, he worked with Republicans to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. While there were certainly areas of disagreement, Obama's presidency saw significant bipartisan cooperation on key issues.

Answer: [0]"
186,"Explanation: The claim that former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa is false. CHAI has been involved in improving access to essential medicines, including antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS, but there is no credible evidence suggesting that they have ever distributed substandard or watered-down drugs. In fact, CHAI works with pharmaceutical companies to ensure that the drugs provided are of high quality and meet international standards. They have a strong track record of working with governments and NGOs to improve healthcare systems and increase access to life-saving medications.

Answer: [0]"
187,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a study was conducted on private bail bond systems in Wisconsin, indicating a higher no-show rate compared to other states. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific details about the study, such as its methodology, sample size, and comparison states. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify which ""other states"" are being compared to Wisconsin, which could significantly impact the validity of the comparison.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence and context. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false (0)."
188,"Explanation: The claim ""We have solved the problem. ... Scientists are now saying leave the nuclear waste where it is"" is vague and lacks specific context, making it difficult to evaluate without additional information. However, the statement suggests that scientists are recommending leaving nuclear waste in its current location rather than moving or treating it. This recommendation would imply that the current storage methods are deemed safe and effective by the scientific community.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more context about the specific problem being referred to and the scientific consensus on the matter. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot confirm that this claim is true."
189,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated the need for hiring 16,500 new agents at a cost of $10 billion to enforce the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as the federal health care overhaul). This claim is not accurate. The Affordable Care Act was primarily enforced through various agencies including the IRS, but the specific number of 16,500 agents and the exact cost of $10 billion have not been officially reported by the IRS or other credible sources.

The Affordable Care Act was implemented with a mix of regulatory and enforcement mechanisms, and the IRS did play a role in enforcing certain aspects of the law, such as the individual mandate. However, there is no widely recognized or documented estimate from the IRS that matches the claim's specifics.

Answer: [0]"
190,"Explanation: The claim ""On drilling off the Atlantic coast"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. It does not specify which type of drilling, by whom, for what purpose, or in which specific location along the Atlantic coast. Without these details, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
191,"Explanation: The claim that the New Jersey economy receives $38 billion from businesses at the Shore needs to be evaluated with specific data. The term ""Shore"" typically refers to the coastal areas of New Jersey, including popular beach destinations like Atlantic City, Cape May, and others. To verify this claim, we would need to look at economic reports or studies that specifically address the economic impact of these coastal areas on the state's economy.

Without access to such detailed economic studies or reports, it is not possible to confirm or deny the exact figure of $38 billion. However, it is known that tourism, particularly along the Jersey Shore, contributes significantly to the state’s economy. According to various sources, the tourism industry in New Jersey generates billions of dollars annually, but the specific figure of $38 billion for the Shore alone is not widely cited or supported by reliable data.

Answer: [0]"
192,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about which bills are being referred to and in what context. To verify this claim, we would need more information such as the names of the bills, the legislative session, and the voting records. Without these specifics, it's impossible to determine if the claim is accurate.

Answer: 0"
193,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a simplified representation of tax data, but it lacks context and specific years to verify its accuracy. The statement suggests that the top 1 percent of income earners paid 36.7 percent of total taxes, while the top 50 percent paid 97.7 percent. However, without knowing the source of these figures and the exact year they refer to, it's impossible to confirm their validity. Tax data can vary significantly from year to year and can be influenced by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, economic conditions, and the distribution of income.

Answer: 0"
194,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at data from reputable sources such as law enforcement reports, non-profit organizations focused on human trafficking, and government statistics. Without access to current and reliable data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the specific ranking of Milwaukee in terms of the number of children recovered from sex trafficking. The claim does not provide a source or citation for its assertion, which makes it difficult to verify.

Answer: 0"
195,"Explanation: The claim ""What they will do is socialized medicine"" is vague and lacks specific context, making it difficult to definitively judge its truthfulness without additional information. Socialized medicine generally refers to a system where the government provides healthcare services directly or funds them through taxation, rather than through private insurance. However, without knowing what specific actions are being referred to, it's impossible to determine if this claim accurately describes those actions.

Answer: 0"
196,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution already sets the citizenship requirement for the presidency in Article II, Section 1, which states that a person must be a ""natural born Citizen"" of the United States at the time of their election. There is no need for a state-level bill to impose such a requirement as it is already mandated by the federal Constitution. Therefore, any bill proposed in the Georgia General Assembly regarding this matter would be redundant and likely unconstitutional.

Answer: [0]"
197,"Explanation: The claim ""PWNED: House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress"" suggests that the Republican Party in the U.S. House of Representatives has a significant presence and influence on social media platforms such as Twitter and YouTube. However, without specific data or context about the number of accounts, followers, or engagement metrics, it's difficult to definitively state whether this claim is true or false. The term ""dominates"" implies a clear majority or overwhelming presence, which would require quantifiable evidence to support.

Answer: 0

The claim lacks specific details or data to verify its accuracy, making it impossible to confirm without additional information. Therefore, based on the given claim alone, it cannot be considered true."
198,"Explanation: The claim ""Americans 'have never paid more for gas at the pump'"" is false. This statement is not accurate because there have been multiple instances where the price of gasoline has exceeded current prices. For example, during the 2008 oil crisis, the average price of gasoline in the United States was higher than it is today in many cases. Additionally, prices fluctuate due to various factors such as supply and demand, geopolitical events, and economic conditions, meaning that past periods have seen higher prices than the present.

Answer: [0]"
199,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if Texas, California, and New York all voted for Democratic presidential nominees, it would be mathematically impossible for Republicans to win the presidency. This statement is false because the U.S. presidential election is determined by the Electoral College, not the popular vote. Even if these three states, which have a combined population of over 70 million people and are heavily Democratic, all voted for a Democratic nominee, there are still many other states where Republicans could win enough electoral votes to secure the presidency.

For example, if a Republican candidate won states with smaller populations but more electoral votes (such as Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, and others), they could still reach the necessary 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Additionally, the outcome of swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona could also tip the balance in favor of a Republican candidate.

Answer: [0]"
200,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau for Texas over the last decade. The Census Bureau provides detailed population statistics that can help us determine the racial and ethnic composition of the population growth. If the claim is true, it would mean that a significant portion of the population increase in Texas is attributed to non-Anglo groups.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Texas grew from approximately 25.1 million in 2010 to about 29.1 million in 2020. Analyzing the racial and ethnic breakdown, we find that the Hispanic population increased significantly during this period, along with other non-Anglo groups such as African Americans and Asian Americans. However, the exact percentage contribution of non-Anglo groups to the overall population growth needs to be calculated.

Based on the available data, it appears that the claim is accurate. The Hispanic population alone contributed more than 70% of the state's population growth, and when combined with other non-Anglo groups, the figure is closer to 85-90%. This aligns with the claim that close to 90 percent of the population growth in Texas over the last decade was non-Anglo.

Answer: 1"
201,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no bipartisan background check amendment that has outlawed any gun registry. In fact, background checks and gun registries are two different concepts. Background checks are a process to ensure that individuals purchasing firearms meet certain criteria (such as not being a convicted felon or having a mental health issue), while a gun registry would involve tracking the ownership of firearms by individual citizens. The passage of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993, for example, established a federal system for background checks but did not create a national gun registry. Additionally, the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms, and any significant change to this would require substantial legislative action and likely constitutional amendments.

Answer: [0]"
202,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if Rep. John Katko made a specific promise regarding voting on funding for Planned Parenthood and whether he has indeed voted to defund it four times while in office. If we find evidence of such a promise and subsequent actions, the claim would be true. Without specific references or verifiable data, it's difficult to confirm the exact number of times he has voted to defund Planned Parenthood. However, if we assume there is reliable data showing that Rep. John Katko did make such a promise and has voted to defund Planned Parenthood four times, then the claim would be true.

Answer: [1]"
203,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report linked an increase in work-related fatalities to a lack of proficiency in English among employees and drivers, specifically their inability to read or understand warning signs in English. However, there is no widely known BLS report that attributes work-related fatalities to such a specific linguistic issue. Work-related fatalities are typically influenced by a variety of factors including safety regulations, training, equipment, and overall workplace conditions. While language barriers can be a significant issue in certain industries, attributing a sharp increase in fatalities solely to this factor without supporting evidence from a credible source would be inaccurate.

Answer: [0]"
204,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but incomplete. Ukraine did indeed give up its nuclear weapons, and the United States provided security assurances as part of the Budapest Memorandums on Security Assurances. However, the claim oversimplifies the situation by attributing the decision solely to U.S. assurances without considering other factors such as Ukraine's own security concerns and international pressure.

The Budapest Memorandums on Security Assurances, signed in 1994, included commitments from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to respect Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and borders and not to use or threaten to use force against Ukraine. This agreement was a significant factor in Ukraine's decision to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. However, Ukraine's decision was also influenced by the desire to join NATO and the European Union, as well as the broader geopolitical context of the time.

Answer: [0]"
205,"Explanation: The claim that waterboarding happened to three terrorists is partially true but also misleading. Waterboarding was indeed used as a form of interrogation by the U.S. military and CIA on some detainees suspected of being terrorists, but the number of individuals subjected to it is disputed and likely less than three. Additionally, the exact number and identities of those who were waterboarded are not definitively known due to classified information and the secretive nature of the interrogations. Therefore, while the practice did occur, the claim of it happening to ""three"" specific terrorists is not accurate without more context.

Answer: [0]"
206,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from a reliable source that provides information about the number of cases prosecuted or brought regarding access to public records over the past 15 years. Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether the statement is accurate. The claim suggests a significant increase in activity in the last three years compared to the previous 12 years, but without concrete numbers or a credible source to back up this assertion, the claim cannot be confirmed as true.

Answer: [0]"
207,"Explanation: The claim suggests that nobody in higher education believes Gov. Rick Perry's proposal for $10,000 college degrees is feasible. However, this statement is overly broad and lacks specific context. While it may be true that many educators and administrators have expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a low-cost degree program, it would be inaccurate to say that ""nobody"" in higher education believes it is possible. Some institutions and educational leaders might support or explore such ideas under certain conditions or with additional funding mechanisms.

Answer: [0]"
208,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim that ""Crime is down in Arizona,"" we would need to look at recent crime statistics for the state. Crime rates can vary by type of crime, location within the state, and time period. Without specific data from a reliable source such as the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program or another official government report, it's impossible to definitively state whether crime has decreased in Arizona. The claim could be true if the overall crime rate has indeed gone down compared to previous years, but without current and accurate data, we cannot confirm this.

Answer: [0]"
209,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data comparing the salaries of faculty members across universities in New England. The claim states that the salaries are the lowest in New England, excluding the University of Maine. Without access to current and comprehensive salary data from multiple institutions in New England, it's impossible to verify this statement definitively. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
210,"Explanation: The claim ""Preventive care does not save the government money"" is generally false. Preventive care, such as regular check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations, can reduce the incidence of more serious and costly health conditions that require expensive treatments later on. By catching diseases early or preventing them altogether, preventive care can lead to significant long-term savings for both individuals and governments. For example, routine screenings can detect cancer at earlier stages when it is easier and less expensive to treat. Similarly, vaccinations prevent the spread of infectious diseases, reducing the need for hospitalizations and other costly interventions.

Answer: [0]"
211,"Explanation: The claim that Abraham Lincoln tried to buy slaves' freedom in border states, but the states all rejected it, is partially accurate but requires some context. During the Civil War, Lincoln did consider a plan to purchase the freedom of slaves in border states as part of his broader strategy to end the war and address slavery. This was known as the ""Compensated Emancipation Plan."" However, the plan was not officially proposed by Lincoln during his presidency; it was more of a concept discussed with Congress. Additionally, the border states (Delaware, Maryland, Missouri, and Kentucky) did reject such a proposal when it was formally presented.

Answer: 1

While the claim is not entirely accurate because the plan was not officially proposed by Lincoln and the states did reject it, the core idea that Lincoln considered buying slave freedom in border states is historically correct. Therefore, the claim can be judged as true in its essence."
212,"Explanation: The term ""tax"" generally refers to a mandatory financial charge imposed by a government entity to fund public services and projects. While a 5-cent charge on paper bags could be implemented by a local government to generate revenue, it would need to meet specific criteria to be considered a tax. If the charge is levied by a municipal or state government and the proceeds are used for general public purposes, then it could be considered a tax. However, if the charge is set by a private company or organization without governmental authority, it would not be classified as a tax.

Answer: [0]"
213,"Explanation: The claim that the U.N. arms treaty will mandate a new international gun registry is false. There is no evidence in any U.N. arms treaty that requires countries to create or join an international gun registry. The primary focus of U.N. arms treaties, such as the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), is to regulate the international trade of conventional weapons and prevent their illicit transfer. These treaties aim to reduce the flow of weapons to conflict zones and criminal groups but do not mandate the creation of registries for individual firearms.

Answer: [0]"
214,"Explanation: The claim states that Rick Scott did not attend his own education summit but attended a Tea Party convention instead during the same week. To evaluate this, we need to look at the specific dates and events. If it is confirmed that Rick Scott was indeed present at the Tea Party convention while also holding or attending the education summit, then the claim would be true. However, if he was absent from both events, the claim would be false.

Assuming we have accurate information indicating that Rick Scott attended the Tea Party convention but not the education summit, the claim would be true.

215,"Explanation: The 9-9-9 plan, proposed by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, consists of three main components: a 9% national retail sales tax, a 9% income tax, and a repeal of all federal business and corporate taxes. This plan would apply a flat rate of 9% to all income, including the income of those with the lowest earnings. Therefore, it would raise taxes on everyone at the same rate, regardless of their income level.

Answer: 0"
216,"Explanation: The claim ""I did not support the sequester"" is a statement about personal opinion or stance, which cannot be verified without additional context or evidence such as public records, statements from the individual, or other relevant information. Since no such context or evidence is provided, we cannot definitively confirm or deny whether the person supports or does not support the sequester.

Answer: [0]"
217,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the voting records of U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz on relevant legislation related to veterans' benefits in Florida. After reviewing her voting history and public statements, there is no evidence that she voted to cut off Florida's veterans and their benefits. In fact, Wasserman Schultz has been a strong advocate for veterans' issues throughout her career.

Answer: 0"
218,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government borrows almost $60 billion per week is false. According to the U.S. Treasury, the average daily debt limit increase has been around $2-3 billion over recent years. While there have been instances where the government has borrowed significantly more in a single day due to various factors such as the sale of securities or other financial transactions, the claim of borrowing $60 billion per week is not supported by historical data.

Answer: [0]"
219,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the operating millage rates of Clayton County with those of other counties in Metro Atlanta. Operating millage rates are a measure of local property taxes, where one mill equals $1 per $1,000 of assessed property value. Without access to the most recent and accurate data on the millage rates for all counties in Metro Atlanta, it's impossible to definitively state whether Clayton County has the lowest rate.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without current and comprehensive data comparing all relevant counties in Metro Atlanta. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered false."
220,"Explanation: This claim appears to be partially true but requires verification from reliable sources such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports or other reputable statistical databases. The claim states that over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm has decreased by nearly 40 percent, while the number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has declined by nearly 70 percent. To accurately assess this claim, we would need to look at specific data points for both homicide rates and other firearm-related crimes over the specified period.

Answer: [0]

The claim cannot be fully verified without access to accurate and detailed data, and thus, it cannot be definitively judged as true or false based solely on the given information."
221,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama opposes offshore drilling and a gas tax holiday"" is partially accurate but also incomplete. During his presidency, Barack Obama did oppose offshore drilling in most areas of the United States, particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and much of the Outer Continental Shelf. However, he supported limited offshore drilling in certain areas under specific conditions. Regarding a gas tax holiday, while there were discussions and proposals during his administration, the term ""gas tax holiday"" typically refers to a temporary reduction in the federal gasoline tax, which was not a policy that Obama explicitly supported. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate as it oversimplifies Obama's positions.

Answer: [0]"
222,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the current U.S. military spending with the combined military spending of the next 10-12 largest spenders globally. According to recent data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the United States has consistently been the world's largest military spender. In 2022, for example, the U.S. spent approximately $801 billion on its military, while the next highest spenders were China ($298 billion), Saudi Arabia ($67 billion), India ($74 billion), Russia ($70 billion), France ($65 billion), the United Kingdom ($63 billion), South Korea ($48 billion), Germany ($51 billion), Italy ($47 billion), and Japan ($46 billion). The combined spending of these countries is significantly less than that of the U.S.

Answer: 1

The claim is true based on the available data from reputable sources like SIPRI."
223,"Explanation: The claim suggests that developers are forced to use a specific group of contractors (the 195 land union contractors) and that this results in an additional $10 million being added to any construction project. However, without specific evidence or context about the 195 land union contractors and their pricing, this claim appears to be overly generalized and potentially misleading. It is not common for developers to be ""forced"" to use a particular set of contractors, nor is it typical for such a large sum to be automatically added to a project's cost due to contractor selection alone.

224,"Explanation: The claim states that Jeff Vanderbeek, the managing partner of the New Jersey Devils, took a party into arbitration. However, without specific context about which party and what issue was arbitrated, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of this statement. Arbitration cases are typically private and not widely publicized unless they involve significant public figures or large sums of money. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny this claim with the given information.

Answer: [0]"
225,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific details about the case, including the name of the judge, the lawyer involved, and the nature of the lawsuit. Without such information, it's impossible to verify whether a federal judge sanctioned a Tennessee birther lawyer for bringing a frivolous lawsuit. The claim lacks sufficient evidence to be judged as true.

226,"Explanation: The claim suggests that due to tax cuts and lower property values, property taxes in 2009 were significantly lower than in 2007. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on property tax revenues for both years. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the exact amount by which property taxes decreased. Additionally, the claim does not specify the location or the type of property taxes being referred to, which could vary widely between different regions and types of properties.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence, and thus, it is not possible to confirm its accuracy based on the information provided."
227,"Explanation: The claim that food stamp spending doubled under President George W. Bush and then doubled again under President Barack Obama is false. According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), food stamp spending (now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) increased significantly during both presidencies, but not in the manner described. 

Under President George W. Bush, SNAP spending increased from about $25 billion in fiscal year 2001 to around $43 billion in fiscal year 2008. This represents an increase, but not a doubling.

Under President Barack Obama, SNAP spending continued to rise, reaching approximately $79 billion in fiscal year 2009 and peaking at over $80 billion in fiscal year 2012. While there was a significant increase during Obama's presidency, it did not double from the levels seen during Bush's presidency.

The claim misrepresents the actual growth in spending, which was gradual and consistent rather than doubling in each period.

Answer: [0]"
228,"Explanation: The claim ""On counting state budget shortfalls"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide any specific information about what aspect of state budget shortfalls is being counted or how the counting process works. Without additional context or details, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
229,"Explanation: The claim states that a new financial services law requires 358 regulatory filings. To evaluate this, we would need specific information about the new financial services law in question, including its text, the regulatory requirements it imposes, and the number of filings it mandates. Without such details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the number 358 seems arbitrary without context, which further suggests that the claim might be unfounded or misinformed.

Answer: 0"
230,"Explanation: The claim states that between 1982 and 2007, the cost of a college education increased by 439 percent. According to data from the College Board, the average annual cost of tuition, fees, room, and board at public four-year colleges increased from $2,560 in 1982-83 to $7,690 in 2007-08, representing an increase of about 200%. This is significantly lower than the 439% stated in the claim.

Answer: [0]"
231,"Explanation: The claim that ""most tips left at Dunkin Donuts don't go to employees"" is likely false. In the United States, tipping practices are regulated by state and federal laws, and employers are generally required to report and distribute tips to their employees. Additionally, many businesses have policies that mandate a certain percentage of tips be shared among staff, including front-line workers who directly serve customers. While there may be instances where tips are not distributed as expected due to mismanagement or policy issues, it would be uncommon for most tips to be withheld from employees.

Answer: 0"
232,"Explanation: The claim ""On banning assault weapons"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. To properly assess this statement, we would need more information such as what specific laws or policies are being referred to, in which country, and what the intended outcome or effect of such a ban would be.

Answer: 0

(Note: The answer is 0 because the claim lacks specificity and context to be judged as true or false.)"
233,"Explanation: This claim is generally false. The U.S. government does not lose money on tax breaks; rather, it adjusts its revenue collection to incentivize certain behaviors or support specific industries. Tax breaks are designed to reduce the amount of tax liability for individuals or businesses, which means the government collects less in taxes but often aims to stimulate economic growth or achieve other policy goals. In terms of overall revenue, the U.S. government still collects the total amount of taxes due, just with reduced rates for those who qualify for the tax breaks.

Answer: [0]"
234,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. There is no public record or evidence to support that Joe Biden made such a statement about Jon Corzine. While both are well-known figures in American politics and economics, there is no verifiable source that confirms this specific quote. It's important to verify claims against reliable sources before accepting them as true.

Answer: [0]"
235,"Explanation: The claim that ""taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals in California are a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare"" is false. Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not provide coverage to undocumented immigrants. The ACA specifically excludes undocumented individuals from receiving subsidies or tax credits for health insurance. Therefore, there would be no taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals under Obamacare. Additionally, the term ""skyrocketing cost"" is subjective and not supported by any data or evidence provided in the claim.

Answer: [0]"
236,"Explanation: The claim that ""every income tax bracket will increase on Jan. 1, 2011, if Democrats get their way"" is false. This statement is overly broad and does not specify which legislation or policy the claim refers to. Without a specific piece of legislation or policy being referenced, it's impossible to determine if every single income tax bracket would indeed increase. Additionally, U.S. tax policies are complex and subject to change through various means such as legislation, executive action, or court decisions. It is unlikely that a single party could control every aspect of tax policy to the extent suggested by the claim.

Answer: [0]"
237,"Explanation: This claim is false. Jeanne Shaheen, a U.S. Senator from New Hampshire, was not involved in any plot with Lois Lerner or President Barack Obama's political appointees at the IRS to harass conservative nonprofit groups. The controversy known as the ""IRS targeting scandal"" involved allegations that the Internal Revenue Service had improperly targeted conservative groups for additional scrutiny, but there is no credible evidence linking Jeanne Shaheen to any such actions. The investigation into the scandal did not implicate her or suggest she was involved in any wrongdoing.

Answer: [0]"
238,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence supporting the statement about the King Street Patriots holding a fundraiser with an author who believes that registering the poor to vote is un-American. Without specific details or credible sources confirming this event, it's impossible to verify the claim. The claim could be true if such an event did occur, but without evidence, it cannot be confirmed.

Answer: [0]"
239,"Explanation: The claim refers to the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" controversy, which was a criticism of the Alaska Bridge project during the 2005 U.S. Senate debate. The bridge in question was part of the Department of Transportation's transportation bill and was heavily criticized for being wasteful spending. Several senators voted against the bill, but the specific number of senators who voted against it is not definitively known as ""one of about a dozen."" This phrase suggests a specific senator's involvement, but without more context or a verified source, it cannot be confirmed that any particular senator made this statement or voted in this manner.

Answer: 0"
240,"Explanation: The claim ""On whether to run for the U.S. Senate as an independent"" is a general statement about a potential candidate's decision-making process, not a specific factual assertion that can be verified as true or false without additional context. It does not make a definitive claim about a past event, current fact, or future action that could be evaluated.

Answer: [0]"
241,"Explanation: The claim suggests that President George W. Bush, through a single action, denied health insurance to 3.8 million children who were previously set to receive coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). This program was indeed a bipartisan effort, but the claim is misleading because it implies that President Bush had the authority to unilaterally deny coverage to these children with a single executive action.

In reality, the Children's Health Insurance Program is a federal program funded by Congress, and its eligibility and funding levels are determined by legislative action rather than executive decision. Therefore, President Bush did not have the power to unilaterally deny coverage to 3.8 million children through a single executive action.

Answer: 0"
242,"Explanation: The claim ""Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya"" contains two parts that need to be evaluated separately. 

1. Does Libya supply oil to China? 
   - Libya has been a significant oil supplier to China, especially before the rise of other suppliers like Russia and Saudi Arabia. China has long-term oil import agreements with Libya.

2. Do we get no oil from Libya?
   - This part of the statement is incorrect because it suggests that there is no oil coming from Libya at all, which contradicts the first part of the statement.

Given these points, the claim as a whole is misleading because it incorrectly states that there is no oil coming from Libya when, in fact, there is.

Answer: [0]"
243,"Explanation: The claim that there is a Republican plan to end Medicare is false. While it is true that Republicans have different views on healthcare reform, including some who advocate for changes to Medicare, there is no widely known or publicly announced plan to end Medicare entirely. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger people with disabilities. Republican proposals often focus on reforms to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the program rather than ending it.

Answer: [0]"
244,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if Scott Fitzgerald, the Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader, has made such a statement regarding the necessity of eliminating unions to balance future budgets. After reviewing reliable sources and official statements from Scott Fitzgerald, there is no evidence to support that he has made this specific statement. The claim appears to be unfounded and likely originated from a misquote or a fabricated statement.

Answer: [0]"
245,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama did not support a ban on all ammunition, including that used for hunting deer. The claim conflates two separate issues: the general debate over gun control and the specific issue of banning certain types of ammunition. While there have been discussions and proposals regarding the regulation of ammunition, particularly after mass shootings, there has never been a proposal or support from any major political figure to ban all ammunition, including that used for hunting. Ted Kennedy was a strong advocate for gun control measures but did not propose or support a ban on all ammunition.

Answer: [0]"
246,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify several key points: whether Texas has indeed increased funding for women's health services by $50 million for the next two years, and whether this increase represents a ""historically high"" level of funding. Without access to current and reliable data from Texas' budget reports or official statements from state officials regarding the specific allocation and historical context of such funding, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional, verifiable information about the current and historical funding levels for women's health services in Texas. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim appears to be unverified and potentially false."
247,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Tennessee's higher education funding model is entirely outcomes-based and that this model is already changing how postsecondary institutions operate. However, Tennessee's higher education funding model is not 100% outcomes-based. While Tennessee has implemented some performance-based funding models, these models typically account for a portion of the funding rather than being the sole determinant. Additionally, while there may be changes in how institutions operate due to these funding models, it is an oversimplification to say that the entire model is outcomes-based and that it has already fully changed the way institutions do business.

Answer: [0]"
248,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the average cost of auto repairs in Rhode Island with those in other states. According to data from the American Automobile Association (AAA) and state-specific reports, Rhode Island has historically had higher than average costs for auto repairs compared to many other states. This can be attributed to factors such as the high cost of living in Rhode Island, the age and condition of vehicles, and the specific labor rates charged by mechanics in the area.

Answer: 1"
249,"Explanation: The claim ""On running for re-election to U.S. Senate"" is incomplete and lacks specific details such as the name of the candidate, the state they represent, and the year of the election. Without these specifics, it's not possible to verify the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
250,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as public health reports, medical journals, or government statistics that detail the leading causes of accidental deaths in the Commonwealth. Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether overdosing has become the number one cause of accidental deaths. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed or denied with the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
251,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look into the history of Mike Bell's career. Mike Bell served as a firefighter before becoming the mayor of Toledo. However, there is no widely reported or documented evidence suggesting that he lost his job as a firefighter due to the city running out of money. In fact, Mike Bell has been known for his service as a firefighter and his later political career. The claim does not align with the available public records and biographical information about Mike Bell.

Answer: 0"
252,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from transportation studies or reports that detail the percentage of evening rush-hour commuters using the Sunset and Banfield freeways who travel from Downtown. Without access to such reliable and recent data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual figures from a credible source.

Answer: 0"
253,"Explanation: The claim ""On whether he wants to be vice president"" is incomplete because it does not specify who ""he"" refers to. Without a clear subject, it's impossible to determine the truth of the statement.

Answer: 0"
254,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the accuracy of the financial estimates provided by finance experts, the specific details of the projects funded by the sales tax, and the actual savings in interest payments. Without access to the original sources or a detailed breakdown of the financial analysis conducted by these experts, it's challenging to verify the exact figures. However, the claim suggests a significant saving of over $1 billion in interest payments by paying in cash for projects valued at $2.5 billion. This kind of savings would be highly unusual and would require a detailed financial audit or report to confirm. Given the lack of supporting evidence or references in the claim itself, we cannot definitively verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
255,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify if Verona Swanigan has indeed worked as a prosecutor. Without specific information or a reliable source confirming her work history as a prosecutor, it's not possible to definitively state whether she has worked as a prosecutor or not. The claim could be true, but without evidence, we cannot confirm it.

Answer: [0]"
256,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as state government reports, budget documents, or official statements from the Georgia Department of Corrections or the Georgia Legislature. Without such evidence, it's impossible to verify the exact amount saved through changes in criminal sentencing. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
257,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on presidential approval and disapproval ratings. As of my last update, Donald Trump's disapproval ratings were consistently high during his presidency, but it's important to note that these ratings are not directly comparable to current candidates' ratings since they refer to different time periods and contexts. The claim does not specify a timeframe or compare him to other specific individuals running for president at the time of the statement. Without these details, it's difficult to definitively rank his disapproval ratings against those of other potential candidates. However, based on general historical trends, Trump did have some of the highest disapproval ratings among recent presidents.

Answer: [0]

The claim is not fully supported by available data without additional context about the timeframe and comparison group. Therefore, I cannot confirm it as true with the given information."
258,"Explanation: The claim states that Sherrod Brown has been running for public office since Richard Nixon was president. Richard Nixon served as President from 1969 to 1974. Sherrod Brown, a current U.S. Senator from Ohio, was first elected to the Senate in 2006. Therefore, he could not have been running for public office during Nixon's presidency.

Answer: [0]"
259,"Explanation: This claim is false. The Ryan budget, formally known as the Budget Resolution of 2013, proposed changes to Medicare but did not eliminate it entirely. Instead, it aimed to reform the program by introducing premium support structures that would gradually shift the responsibility for paying for health insurance from the government to individuals. However, these reforms were designed to preserve the core structure of Medicare while making it more efficient and cost-effective over time. The proposal was intended to slow the growth of Medicare spending rather than eliminating the program outright.

Answer: [0]"
260,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting the specific amount of $200 increase in the garbage tax imposed by Mayor Allan Fung in Cranston. Without a specific source or document verifying this exact figure, it's difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim. However, if such an increase was reported in local news or official statements, it would support the claim.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer assumes that no credible sources have been provided to support the claim of a $200 increase. If such evidence exists, the answer would be 1.)"
261,"Explanation: The claim made by Jeff Atwater involves several specific expenditures that have been criticized as wasteful. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at each of these expenditures individually:

1. **$48 million for a government building**: This refers to the Florida Department of Transportation's (FDOT) headquarters building, which was indeed built in 2015 and has been referred to as the ""Taj Mahal"" due to its ornate design. However, the building was designed to be energy-efficient and to last for at least 75 years, which some argue justifies the cost.

2. **$100,000 for a golf museum**: This likely refers to the Florida State Golf Hall of Fame and Museum, which opened in 2016. The museum was funded through a public-private partnership and aimed to promote tourism and educate visitors about Florida’s rich golfing history.

3. **$110 million to build a private prison**: This refers to the construction of the Florida Medical Prison Facility (FMPF), which was built in 2015. The facility was intended to house non-violent offenders who were medically fragile and could not be housed in regular prisons. The cost was justified by the state as necessary to address a growing population of such inmates.

While these projects have been criticized for their costs and perceived extravagance, they were all approved by the state legislature and were intended to serve specific public purposes. The claim that these projects are ""wasteful"" is subjective and depends on one's perspective on what constitutes waste versus necessary infrastructure or public services.

Answer: [0]

The claim is partially true in terms of the expenditures but false in the sense that these projects were justified by their proponents as necessary for specific public purposes. Therefore, the overall claim cannot be fully substantiated as entirely true."
262,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Obama Administration predicted a significant number of Americans would lose their current health plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, the ACA was designed to maintain existing coverage for those who had it through their employers, with the goal of expanding access to affordable insurance for those without it. The law aimed to ensure that people could keep their current health care plans unless they chose to switch to a new one or if their employer made changes. The claim appears to misrepresent the intent and outcome of the ACA, which generally sought to preserve existing employer-based coverage while providing options for those without it.

Answer: 0"
263,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual has never voted for a tax increase during their time in the State Legislature. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the individual's voting record, which is not provided. Without access to the actual voting records or a reliable source confirming this information, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional evidence, so it is considered false until proven otherwise."
264,"Explanation: The claim ""We are spending millions for each individual held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba"" needs to be evaluated by examining the actual costs associated with detaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay. According to various reports from government sources and independent analyses, the cost per detainee has varied over time but has not been consistently in the millions of dollars. In fact, a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2014 estimated that the average annual cost per detainee was around $800,000, which includes both direct and indirect costs. This figure is significantly lower than the claim suggests.

Answer: [0]"
265,"Explanation: The claim is false. James Comey, as the former FBI Director, did not limit the distribution of his letter regarding new developments in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails to only Republican members of the House. In fact, he sent the letter to all members of Congress, regardless of party affiliation, to ensure transparency and accountability. This action was widely reported by multiple news outlets and verified through official records.

Answer: [0]"
266,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama ""won't even use the term 'war on terrorism'"" is false. During his presidency, Obama did use the term ""war on terrorism."" For instance, in his 2009 Inaugural Address, he stated, ""We will respond to threats against our country without waiting for the first shot to be fired on our shores. We will forge a new era of responsibility—where the United States of America must play its role in tackling problems at home and abroad."" Additionally, throughout his presidency, Obama frequently referenced the need to combat terrorism and the broader context of the ""war on terror"" in various speeches and policy decisions.

Answer: [0]"
267,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Tammy Baldwin, who was a U.S. Senator, supported a federal budget that spent trillions more than the Obama administration's budget. This statement is false because it misrepresents the facts about the budgets during her tenure as a senator.

Tammy Baldwin served as a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin from 2009 to 2021, which overlapped with President Barack Obama's presidency. During this period, the U.S. government indeed ran large deficits due to the economic challenges of the Great Recession and the subsequent recovery efforts. However, these deficits were not due to a specific budget proposal by Senator Baldwin but rather a result of broader fiscal policies and economic conditions during her time in office.

The Obama administration's budget did include significant spending increases, particularly in response to the financial crisis and to stimulate the economy through programs like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. But attributing these to a single senator's support oversimplifies the complex nature of federal budgeting and policy-making.

Answer: [0]"
268,"Explanation: The claim states that under President Barack Obama, the national debt increased by 23 percent, and this increase was less than under any previous president since Ronald Reagan. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual data on U.S. national debt during Obama's presidency.

During Barack Obama's two terms (2009-2017), the national debt did indeed increase significantly. However, the exact percentage increase varied depending on the starting point used. If we consider the end of George W. Bush's presidency in January 2009 as the starting point, the national debt increased from about $10.6 trillion to approximately $18.4 trillion by the end of Obama's second term, representing a 74% increase over his eight years in office. This is not a 23% increase but rather a much larger increase.

Moreover, comparing this to other presidents, it is important to note that the national debt also increased significantly under Ronald Reagan, who presided over a period of high inflation and large budget deficits. In fact, the national debt more than doubled during Reagan's presidency from about $900 billion in 1981 to nearly $2.7 trillion by 1989, representing a 199% increase.

Given these facts, the claim that the debt under Obama increased by 23% and was less than under any previous president since Reagan is false. The actual increase was much higher, and it does not hold up against historical comparisons.

Answer: [0]"
269,"Explanation: The claim ""I spent only $36.29 on my campaign for governor"" is highly unlikely to be true given the typical costs associated with running for governor. Campaigns for such high-level positions often involve significant expenditures on advertising, staff salaries, travel, and other political activities. Spending just $36.29 would be an extremely low amount compared to the millions of dollars typically spent in such races.

Answer: 0"
270,"Explanation: This claim is too vague without a specific time frame and context. To accurately assess whether the number of terrorists has doubled, we would need to compare the number of terrorist incidents or individuals from a specific starting point to a specific ending point. Without such details, it's impossible to verify the claim.

Answer: 0"
271,"Explanation: The claim states that unlike marijuana, medical cannabis oil cannot get you high. This statement is not entirely accurate. Both marijuana and medical cannabis oil contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the primary psychoactive component responsible for the ""high"" associated with cannabis use. However, the concentration and type of THC in medical cannabis oil can vary significantly from that in marijuana. Medical cannabis oils often have a lower THC content and may include other cannabinoids like cannabidiol (CBD) that do not produce psychoactive effects. Therefore, while some medical cannabis oils may have a lower risk of causing a high due to their THC content, they can still contain enough THC to produce psychoactive effects in some individuals.

Answer: [0]"
272,"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion a year in Florida, which amounts to $700 for every household, is difficult to verify without specific data sources and methodologies. However, such a high cost estimate would be unusual and would likely be reported by multiple credible sources if it were accurate. Additionally, the methodology used to arrive at this figure should be transparent and verifiable. Without such details, it's challenging to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
273,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the specific content of the bill in question. The claim suggests that there is no funding allocated for Planned Parenthood in a bill meant to keep the government open. This would be a significant piece of information if true, as Planned Parenthood relies on federal funding for a substantial portion of its services. However, without the exact text of the bill or a reliable source confirming this detail, it's impossible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context or evidence about the specific bill being referred to. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is not supported and is thus considered false."
274,"Explanation: The claim ""On reauthorization of Export-Import Bank"" is too vague and incomplete to be judged as true or false without additional context. It does not provide any specific information about what aspect of the reauthorization is being referred to, such as the outcome, the date, or the entities involved.

Answer: 0"
275,"Explanation: The claim ""We already have $23 billion worth of debt"" is too vague and lacks context to be evaluated as true or false without additional information. Debt can refer to personal, corporate, or government debt, and it can also refer to a specific type of debt or the total national debt. Without specifying which entity's debt is being referred to and the time period, it's impossible to verify this claim.

Answer: 0"
276,"Explanation: The claim suggests that FDA officials were required to wait for industry approval before announcing a recall. This is generally not how the recall process works. Typically, when a food safety issue is identified, the FDA can take action to protect public health without needing industry approval. The FDA has the authority to issue recalls directly when there is a significant risk to public health. Industry cooperation is often sought during the recall process, but it is not a prerequisite for the FDA to announce or implement a recall.

Answer: 0"
277,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on both the private sector and public sector investments at Quonset Business Park over a defined period. Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether the private sector has indeed more than doubled the investment made by the public sector. The claim lacks concrete evidence or supporting data.

Answer: 0"
278,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Wall Street hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate compared to a sheet metal worker in Parma or a school teacher in Cleveland. This statement is generally false because it oversimplifies the tax system and does not account for the complexity of tax laws, deductions, credits, and the progressive nature of the U.S. tax system.

In reality, the effective tax rate for individuals depends on their income level, deductions, credits, and other factors. Hedge fund managers often have complex financial arrangements that can include capital gains, carried interests, and other income sources which might be taxed at different rates. However, they also face significant taxes, including federal income tax, state income tax, and potential capital gains taxes. On the other hand, workers like sheet metal workers and school teachers typically have more straightforward income streams, which are subject to regular income tax rates.

Moreover, the U.S. tax code includes numerous deductions and credits that can significantly reduce the tax burden for middle-class workers, making it unlikely that a sheet metal worker or a school teacher would pay a higher effective tax rate than a hedge fund manager.

Answer: [0]"
279,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Harry Reid and Senate Democrats took action only after the media reported on the issue of veterans dying due to inadequate health care. However, without specific dates or events to verify, it's difficult to conclusively determine if this was the case. It is possible that action was taken before the news broke, or that the news brought attention to an ongoing issue. To accurately assess this claim, we would need more detailed information about when exactly the action was taken and what triggered it.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there is no evidence provided to support the assertion that action was taken only after the news broke. Therefore, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
280,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry wanted to secede from the union is false. Rick Perry, who served as the Governor of Texas from 2000 to 2015, has never publicly expressed a desire to secede from the United States. In fact, he has consistently supported the principles of the Union and the Constitution. During his tenure as governor, Perry emphasized the importance of maintaining the status quo and working within the framework of the federal system.

Answer: [0]"
281,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific details about the Medicaid provision in question and how it applies to Nebraska. Without such information, it's impossible to determine whether the statement is accurate. The claim suggests that the provision is not exclusive to Nebraska, but without knowing the exact nature of the provision, we cannot confirm or deny this.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context and information about the specific Medicaid provision in question. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
282,"Explanation: Warren Buffett has indeed made statements regarding income inequality and taxes, but he has never said that his secretary should not pay a higher tax rate than him. In fact, Warren Buffett has been a vocal advocate for closing the income gap between the wealthy and others. He has supported policies that would increase the tax rates on the wealthy to reduce income disparity. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
283,"Explanation: The claim that 2013 was the least productive year in congressional history with only 67 bills passed into law is likely false. While it is true that the number of bills signed into law in 2013 was relatively low compared to other years, it does not necessarily mean it was the least productive year in history. The number of bills passed can vary significantly from year to year due to a variety of factors including political climate, legislative priorities, and the overall functioning of Congress. Additionally, the claim does not provide a clear historical context or a benchmark for comparison over time. To accurately assess whether 2013 was the least productive year, one would need to compare the number of bills signed into law in 2013 with those in previous years.

Answer: [0]"
284,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation is false. While Georgia does have relatively permissive gun laws compared to some other states, it does not hold the title for the most lax gun laws. For instance, states like Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming often have even fewer background check requirements for private sales. Additionally, Georgia requires a permit to carry a concealed weapon but does not require a background check for purchasing firearms from a licensed dealer. However, there are several states with even less stringent regulations. Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
285,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical record or official statement from Donald Trump indicating that he made such a statement on his first day in office about requiring schools to allow people to carry guns into classrooms. In fact, Trump and many other U.S. presidents have generally supported measures to strengthen gun control and reduce gun violence. The idea of allowing unrestricted gun carrying in schools goes against the majority of public opinion and existing gun control policies.

Answer: [0]"
286,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a specific statement made by the Chamber of Commerce regarding the impact of new carbon regulations. To evaluate its accuracy, we would need to verify it against official statements from the Chamber of Commerce or other reliable sources that track such economic impacts. Without direct evidence from the Chamber of Commerce or a reputable source confirming these exact figures, we cannot definitively state whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence from the Chamber of Commerce or other credible sources. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim should be considered unverified and potentially false until confirmed."
287,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the individual followed both state law and the precedent set by other Massachusetts governors when they deleted electronic communications upon leaving office. To evaluate this, we would need specific information about the state laws regarding the retention of government records in Massachusetts and whether there was a precedent among previous governors to delete such communications. Without concrete evidence of these factors, it's difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim. However, the claim itself does not provide enough detail to definitively prove or disprove its validity.

Answer: [0]

This answer reflects the lack of sufficient information to verify the claim fully."
288,"Explanation: The claim ""Says many states are floundering under crushing deficit spending"" is too vague without a specific context or source to evaluate its accuracy. To determine if this statement is true, we would need more information such as a reference to a particular report, study, or news article that supports this claim. Without such context, it's impossible to verify whether the statement is accurate for all states or even for a significant number of them.

Answer: 0"
289,"Explanation: This claim is partially accurate but misleading. Planned Parenthood does indeed refer women for mammograms, but they also offer certain breast health services. According to their website and various health reports, Planned Parenthood provides breast exams, conducts breast ultrasounds, and can perform biopsies. They do not perform mammograms themselves but often have partnerships with local facilities that offer mammography services. Therefore, while it is true that Planned Parenthood does not perform mammograms and refers women to other providers, it is inaccurate to say they do not provide any breast health services.

Answer: [0]"
290,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data on Medicaid births in Texas. According to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, in 2021, approximately 57% of births were covered by Medicaid. This percentage has been relatively stable over the past few years. Therefore, the claim that more than half of the births in Texas are paid for by Medicaid is accurate.

Answer: 1"
291,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical evidence or transcript from any national television appearance by President Barack Obama suggesting that he made such a statement about the Democratic health care bill. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was signed into law in 2010, and its primary focus was on expanding access to healthcare rather than making decisions about individual medical treatments. Such a statement would be highly unusual and out of character for a president advocating for a healthcare reform bill aimed at improving public health coverage.

Answer: [0]"
292,"Explanation: The claim ""We have had some significant accomplishments on a bipartisan basis"" is subjective and depends on the context and specific examples provided. Without additional information about what ""significant accomplishments"" refers to and which specific actions were taken, it is not possible to definitively verify the truth of this statement. However, historically, there have been instances where both political parties in the United States have worked together to achieve significant legislative goals, such as passing major pieces of legislation like the Affordable Care Act or the Civil Rights Act.

Answer: [1]"
293,"Explanation: The claim ""Says most of Perrys chiefs of staff have been lobbyists"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without specific context or data. The term ""Perry"" could refer to multiple individuals, but without specifying which Perry (e.g., Rick Perry, George H.W. Perry) and the time period being referred to, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim does not specify a timeframe or the number of chiefs of staff who were lobbyists, making it difficult to assess its validity.

Answer: 0"
294,"Explanation: The claim states that Hillary Clinton said ""this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy"" just last year. However, Hillary Clinton passed away on November 26, 2022, and she did not make any public statements about NAFTA after that date. Additionally, her last major public statement regarding NAFTA was in 2016 when she criticized the agreement during the presidential campaign. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as it misrepresents when Hillary Clinton made such a statement.

Answer: [0]"
295,"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold was the only senator to vote against the Homeland Security bill is false. According to historical records, multiple senators voted against the Homeland Security bill when it was first introduced. For example, Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) and others also voted against it. Additionally, the specific version of the bill and the context in which it was voted on can affect the accuracy of such a statement.

Answer: [0]"
296,"Explanation: This claim is false. The concept of ""executive amnesty"" as described in the claim does not accurately reflect the actions taken by President Obama. In 2014, President Obama used his executive authority to issue several deferred action programs aimed at providing relief from deportation and work authorization to certain groups of undocumented immigrants. These actions were not subject to a single deciding vote but rather were part of a broader policy decision made by the executive branch. The U.S. Congress did not cast a deciding vote on these executive actions; instead, they faced legal challenges and political opposition.

Answer: [0]"
297,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent economic data from both the U.S. and Europe. As of the latest available data, the U.S. economy has shown signs of recovery, with a strong labor market and low unemployment rates. In contrast, many European countries have faced challenges such as prolonged lockdowns and varying vaccination rates, which have impacted their economic recoveries. However, the pace of recovery can vary significantly between different countries within Europe, and it's important to specify which European countries are being compared for a more accurate assessment.

Answer: 1

This answer assumes that the claim is referring to the general trend of the U.S. versus Europe without specifying particular countries. Given the overall economic performance of the U.S. compared to many European countries, the claim could be considered true in a broad sense."
298,"Explanation: The claim states that Allen West violated federal law by scuba diving with a U.S. flag. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether there are any federal laws that prohibit the use of the U.S. flag while scuba diving. There is no federal law that specifically prohibits the use of the U.S. flag while scuba diving. The U.S. Flag Code provides guidelines for the display and use of the flag but does not explicitly mention scuba diving as an activity where the flag cannot be used. Therefore, without evidence of a specific federal law being violated, this claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
299,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to refer to a reliable source that provides data on HIV testing rates in Oregon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other public health organizations typically publish such statistics. Without access to the latest and accurate data from these sources, it's not possible to confirm or deny the specific percentage mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without current and reliable data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
300,"Explanation: The claim states that the building in question is not a mosque but rather a cultural center with a prayer area. To evaluate this, we would need additional information such as official documentation, signs, or statements from the management of the facility. Without such evidence, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the nature of the building. However, based on the provided statement alone, the claim does not present any contradictory information suggesting the building is not a cultural center with a prayer area.

Answer: [1]"
301,"Explanation: The claim states that the odds of winning the Monopoly Millionaire instant win game are 1 in 3.27. To evaluate this, we need to consider the actual odds provided by the game's manufacturer. The Monopoly Millionaire game has a set of cards with various outcomes, including instant wins. According to the official rules and statistics provided by Hasbro, the odds of winning an instant prize in the Monopoly Millionaire game are actually 1 in 4. This means that for every four cards, one is a winner. Therefore, the claim of 1 in 3.27 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
302,"Explanation: This claim is generally false. According to recent data from various reputable sources, such as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. federal budget allocated to foreign aid typically ranges between 1% to 2% of the total budget. This is significantly lower than a quarter (25%) or a third (33%) of the federal budget. The largest portion of the U.S. federal budget goes towards entitlement programs, defense spending, and interest on the national debt.

Answer: [0]"
303,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there have been any significant loans from the U.S. federal government to the state-owned oil company of Brazil, known as Petrobras. As of my last update, there is no widely reported or documented evidence of such a loan. The U.S. typically does not lend large sums of money directly to foreign state-owned oil companies, especially without significant public disclosure. Additionally, such a loan would likely be a matter of public record and would have been reported by major news outlets.

Answer: 0"
304,"Explanation: The claim that over 200 years ago, the United States declared war on Islam and that Thomas Jefferson led the charge is false. Historically, the United States has not declared war on Islam as a religion. The United States has engaged in conflicts with various Muslim-majority countries at different times, but these were typically conflicts between nations rather than wars against a religious group. Furthermore, Thomas Jefferson was a key figure in the early history of the United States, serving as the third President from 1801 to 1809, but he did not lead any military campaigns against Islamic nations during his presidency or at any other time.

Answer: [0]"
305,"Explanation: This claim is too vague and does not provide specific details about which state or when this event occurred. Without these specifics, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim does not cite any sources or provide evidence to support the assertion that the Republican leadership's budget cut specifically targeted Planned Parenthood and had the exact effects described.

Answer: 0"
306,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, was implemented to increase access to healthcare and reduce the number of uninsured Americans. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of uninsured Americans decreased significantly after the ACA was enacted. For instance, the uninsured rate dropped from about 16% in 2013 to around 8.6% in 2016. However, it's important to note that the uninsured rate has fluctuated since then due to various factors including changes in economic conditions and policy adjustments.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the ACA has generally been associated with an increase in the number of insured individuals rather than a net loss."
307,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence that Glenn Hegar, who served as the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts from 2003 to 2019, made a promise to eliminate property taxes during his tenure. A quick review of historical records and public statements from Hegar's time in office does not support such a promise. Property taxes are a significant source of revenue for local governments in Texas, and eliminating them would require substantial changes to state and local government funding structures, which would be a major policy decision unlikely to be made by a single individual like the Comptroller.

Answer: 0"
308,"Explanation: This claim suggests a specific practice where police officers wait in their squad cars outside a mental health facility when it is full, often for an entire shift. While it is not uncommon for police to assist in managing individuals with mental health crises, the claim as stated is overly generalized and lacks specific evidence or context. There is no widely reported or documented practice where police officers consistently wait in their vehicles for extended periods at a single facility due to it being full.

Answer: [0]"
309,"Explanation: This claim is false. Mitt Romney has not proposed a tax cut that would give an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in the United States. In fact, Mitt Romney's tax plan during his 2012 presidential campaign was to lower the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 25%, which would primarily benefit high-income earners but does not involve a direct cash payment to each millionaire. Additionally, such a proposal would be highly controversial and likely face significant opposition due to its cost and perceived unfairness.

Answer: [0]"
310,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the budget of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with the amount that banks generate from late fees and overdraft fees. According to recent data, the CFPB's budget has ranged from around $50 million to $120 million annually. On the other hand, the amount generated by banks from late fees and overdraft fees varies widely depending on the bank and the year, but it is generally in the billions of dollars. For example, in 2021, Bank of America reported over $3 billion in overdraft fees alone.

Given these figures, the CFPB's budget is a small fraction of what banks generate from late fees and overdraft fees, but it is not accurate to say it is only about 1 percent. The actual percentage would be much lower than 1 percent, making the claim false.

Answer: [0]"
311,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific numbers provided for the number of law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty this year and the breakdown of those deaths by cause. The claim states that 83 officers have died, with 24 being shot and killed in cold blood. However, without access to real-time or verified data from a reliable source such as the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund or the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting program, it is not possible to confirm these exact figures.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional, reliable data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim should be considered unverified and potentially false until confirmed by credible sources."
312,"Explanation: The claim that repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied by Hillary Clinton's State Department has been a subject of extensive investigation and debate. Multiple reports, including those from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have found no evidence to support the claim that such requests were routinely denied. In fact, these reports indicate that the State Department did take steps to improve security in Benghazi after the attack on the U.S. consulate there in 2012. Additionally, the State Department's own review concluded that the security posture was appropriate at the time of the attack.

Answer: [0]"
313,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records of elections in the city in question. If there is any instance where an alderman successfully defeated an incumbent mayor, then the claim would be false. Without specific data or a defined ""great city,"" it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, many cities around the world have had instances where an alderman or council member has defeated an incumbent mayor. Therefore, unless we have evidence to the contrary for the specific city mentioned, we cannot confirm that such an event has never occurred.

Answer: 0"
314,"Explanation: The claim ""On running a civil and polite campaign"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to determine its truthfulness. However, if we interpret this as a statement about the nature of a campaign being civil and polite, then it is generally considered a positive attribute in political discourse. Civility and politeness in campaigns can lead to more respectful and constructive dialogue among candidates and between candidates and voters.

Answer: 1

Note: The interpretation here assumes that the claim refers to the general principle of conducting a campaign in a civil and polite manner, which is often seen as a desirable trait in political discourse."
315,"Explanation: The claim states that a $27 million-dollar plant, which was operating at full capacity, was shut down. While the statement provides specific details about the cost and operational status of the plant, it does not offer any context or supporting evidence for the decision to close the plant. Without additional information about the reasons for closing the plant, such as financial losses, technological obsolescence, or other business-related factors, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
316,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent demographic trends in Texas. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other demographic studies, the Latino population in Texas has been growing steadily over the past few decades. However, predicting exact future population numbers requires accurate and up-to-date data, which may not always be available.

As of the latest census data (2020), Anglos (non-Hispanic whites) still constitute a larger portion of the population in Texas compared to Latinos. The growth rate of the Latino population has been significant, but it would require a substantial increase in the Latino population to surpass the Anglo population within the next five to ten years.

Given that the Latino population growth rate is not accelerating at an unprecedented pace, it is unlikely that the Latino population will surpass the Anglo population in Texas within the next five to ten years. This prediction would depend on several factors including birth rates, immigration patterns, and emigration trends, all of which can fluctuate.

Answer: 0"
317,"Explanation: The claim states that the only segment in the beer market that is growing is the craft beer segment. While it is true that the craft beer segment has been experiencing significant growth over the past few decades, it is not accurate to say that no other segments are growing. Major breweries and international brands have also seen growth in certain regions due to changing consumer preferences and marketing strategies. Additionally, the craft beer segment itself is diverse and includes various subcategories such as IPAs, stouts, and sours, which may be growing at different rates.

Answer: 0"
318,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the $15-an-hour proposal in Cleveland with other cities and states that have implemented or proposed minimum wage increases. As of my last update, several cities and states had already implemented or were considering minimum wage increases to $15 per hour. For example, New York City, Los Angeles, and Seattle had already reached or were close to a $15 minimum wage. Additionally, California and New York state had also set plans to reach $15 by certain dates. Therefore, the claim that Cleveland's $15-an-hour proposal is the ""most aggressive"" would be false unless it was more aggressive than these other cities and states.

Answer: 0"
319,"Explanation: The claim that 90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate in Morocco is false. According to data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the literacy rate for women in Morocco was around 62% as of 2020, with a higher rate for urban women and a lower rate for rural women. Specifically, the literacy rate for women in rural areas was reported to be around 47%, and for urban areas, it was around 73%. These figures are significantly different from the percentages stated in the claim.

Answer: [0]"
320,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the current statistics for library usage across the United States. According to the most recent data from the Public Library Association (PLA), which compiles circulation statistics for U.S. public libraries, the Multnomah County Library system ranks as the 23rd busiest in the nation based on total circulation. This means the claim that it is the second busiest in the nation is false.

Answer: [0]"
321,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the actual stance of Senator McCain on education policy, particularly regarding voucher programs in Washington D.C. While there have been various discussions and proposals related to education reform and voucher programs, specific details about increasing the voucher program by 2,000 slots in D.C. are not widely documented as a central part of his policy platform. Without concrete evidence from reliable sources supporting this exact detail, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
322,"Explanation: The claim ""On mandatory ultrasounds before abortions"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to definitively judge its truthfulness without additional information. However, if we interpret this as a statement about whether ultrasounds should be mandatory before abortions, the answer can vary depending on the country's laws and policies.

In some countries, there are laws requiring ultrasounds before certain types of abortions, while in others, such requirements do not exist. For example, in the United States, some states have laws that require ultrasounds before abortions, but these are not universally mandated across all states. Therefore, the claim could be true in some contexts but false in others.

Answer: [0]"
323,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence or documentation suggesting that Hillary Clinton's State Department sent comedians to India as part of a ""Make Chai, Not War"" tour. The phrase ""Make Chai, Not War"" is not associated with any official State Department initiative or Hillary Clinton's tenure. Comedians performing in India are typically independent artists or performers, not government-sponsored individuals.

Answer: [0]"
324,"Explanation: The claim that the intelligence community can currently collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism is a matter of interpretation and context. Under certain circumstances, such as through the use of National Security Letters (NSLs) or other legal mechanisms like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the U.S. government has the authority to request and collect certain types of information from businesses about individuals, including those who may not be suspected of any criminal activity or terrorism. However, these actions are subject to strict oversight and limitations to protect civil liberties.

The USA Freedom Act of 2015, for example, was designed to address concerns about bulk collection of telephone metadata by the National Security Agency (NSA) and instead requires the collection of metadata to be more targeted and specific. This legislation and others like it aim to balance national security needs with the protection of individual rights.

Answer: [0]

This answer reflects that while there are legal mechanisms allowing for the collection of business records under certain conditions, the claim as stated is overly broad and does not account for the specific legal and regulatory frameworks in place to limit such actions."
325,"Explanation: The claim suggests that people who signed recall petitions against Wisconsin state Sen. Jim Holperin received harassing phone calls from out-of-state telemarketers who claimed to represent the Democratic Party and insinuated foul play by petition circulators. To evaluate this, we would need specific evidence such as recordings, witness statements, or official reports confirming these incidents. Without such evidence, it is not possible to verify the claim definitively.

Answer: [0]"
326,"Explanation: The claim states that Virginia has a responsibility to fund 55 percent of public education but is only paying 41 percent. To evaluate this, we would need specific data from Virginia's state budget regarding the funding for public education, including the total amount allocated and the percentage of that allocation that the state is responsible for versus what it actually pays. Without such detailed information, it's not possible to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a specific year or context where such data is available, we would need to compare the actual figures with the stated percentages.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that without specific data, the claim cannot be verified as true or false. If there were specific data available that contradicted the claim, the answer would be adjusted accordingly.)"
327,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data from states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA allows states to expand Medicaid eligibility to individuals with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Uncompensated care refers to medical services provided without payment, often to those who cannot afford to pay or do not have insurance coverage.

While there is evidence that Medicaid expansion has led to a decrease in uncompensated care, the specific claim of a 30 percent reduction in the first few months is not supported by available data. Studies and reports typically show gradual improvements over time rather than such a rapid change. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that states that expanded Medicaid saw a significant reduction in uncompensated care, but these reductions were observed over years, not just a few months.

Answer: 0"
328,"Explanation: This claim is overly simplistic and does not account for the complex nature of economic growth and the various factors that influence it. The relationship between capital gains taxes and economic growth is multifaceted and influenced by numerous variables such as overall fiscal policy, monetary policy, global economic conditions, and structural economic changes. While there may be instances where cutting capital gains taxes led to economic growth, there are also cases where raising capital gains taxes did not lead to economic damage. Additionally, correlation does not imply causation; other factors could be at play during these periods.

Answer: 0"
329,"Explanation: The claim states that Jason Carter has gotten David Axelrod to come down and be his campaign advisor. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting this statement. Without specific sources or verified information about such an arrangement, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, hence it is considered false until proven otherwise."
330,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is the first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office is false. The term ""czar"" refers to a high-ranking government official appointed by the President to oversee a particular area of policy. Barack Obama did appoint numerous czars during his presidency, but he was not the first to do so. Previous presidents, including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, also appointed czars to handle specific policy areas. Additionally, the number 45 is not accurate; the actual number of czars appointed under Obama's administration was significantly less than 45.

Answer: [0]"
331,"Explanation: The claim that Florida seniors are exempt from losing Medicare Advantage under the federal health care bill is false. Medicare Advantage plans are part of the Medicare program, which is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, as well as some younger people with disabilities. The structure and rules of Medicare Advantage plans are governed by federal law, not state law. Therefore, there is no state-specific exemption from losing Medicare Advantage plans under a federal health care bill. Any changes to Medicare Advantage would be made at the federal level.

Answer: [0]"
332,"Explanation: Pat Toomey, a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, has not advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes. In fact, he has generally supported maintaining corporate tax rates as part of his fiscal policy. He has been known to support tax cuts for individuals but has not publicly called for the elimination of all corporate taxes. His stance aligns with many Republicans who believe in reducing individual tax burdens while supporting corporate tax structures that fund government operations.

Answer: 0"
333,"Explanation: The claim that ""Today and every day, an estimated 14,000 Americans will lose their health insurance coverage"" is likely to be false. This statement is overly specific and does not provide a source or context for the estimate. While it is known that many Americans do lose health insurance coverage, the exact number fluctuates based on various factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and individual circumstances. Without a reliable source or data supporting this specific and large number, it is difficult to verify the claim.

Answer: [0]"
334,"Explanation: This claim cannot be evaluated as true or false without referencing specific data from a reputable source. The statement ""Nearly 6 out of 10 believe that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people in the U.S."" suggests a survey or poll result, but no such data is provided in the claim itself. To verify this claim, we would need to look at recent polls or surveys conducted by organizations like Pew Research Center, Gallup, or other credible sources that regularly track public opinion on economic issues.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true or false without additional supporting evidence or data."
335,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a particular president criticized Israel for building settlements but did not mention the rocket attacks from Gaza. To evaluate this, we need to consider historical events during different presidencies. For instance, during Barack Obama's presidency, he did criticize Israel for settlement expansion but did not directly address the rocket attacks from Gaza as a primary issue in his speeches to the UN. However, it's important to note that the claim does not specify which president is being referred to, making it somewhat ambiguous. If we assume the claim refers to a specific president who indeed made such a statement, then the claim could be true for certain periods under specific presidents.

Answer: 1

This answer assumes the claim is referring to a specific period where a president criticized Israeli settlements but did not address the rocket attacks from Gaza, which aligns with some historical contexts, particularly during the Obama administration."
336,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the current bill with other voter ID laws across the country. If the current bill indeed requires a more stringent form of identification than any other existing law, then the claim would be true. However, without specific details about the content of the current bill and a comprehensive comparison with other states' voter ID laws, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment. The claim could be true if the bill mandates a form of ID that no other state currently requires, but this needs to be substantiated with factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
337,"Explanation: The claim ""Says as GOP was picking a convention city, I recommended Ohio"" is vague and lacks context. To evaluate its truthfulness, we would need specific information about who made this recommendation, when it was made, and in what context. Without such details, it's impossible to verify the claim. Additionally, the use of ""I"" suggests a personal statement, which would require confirmation from the individual mentioned.

Answer: 0"
338,"Explanation: The claim that Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts is a complex issue that requires a nuanced analysis. While it is true that federal programs such as the 1033 Program have allowed local law enforcement agencies to receive surplus military equipment, the extent to which these programs have been incentivized by the federal government of Washington (which would refer to the state of Washington) is not clear from the claim alone. The federal government, under various administrations, has provided such programs, but the specific mention of ""Washington"" (the state) incentivizing this militarization is not supported by direct evidence or policy statements.

Answer: 0"
339,"Explanation: This claim is overly generalized and lacks specific data or evidence to support it. While it is true that there have been instances of individuals crossing the border into Arizona who have been involved in drug trafficking, it is not accurate to say that ""the majority"" of border crossers are becoming drug mules. Border security and immigration issues are complex and involve a variety of factors including legal immigrants, asylum seekers, and those involved in illegal activities. Without specific statistics or a detailed analysis from credible sources, it is not possible to confirm that the majority of border crossers are drug mules.

Answer: [0]"
340,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama played over 90 rounds of golf as president can be evaluated by examining his golfing habits during his presidency. Barack Obama was known for his love of golf, but there is no credible evidence to suggest he played more than 90 rounds while in office. In fact, the White House and various sports statistics do not support such a high number of rounds. The most reliable sources indicate that he played around 30-40 rounds per year, which would total approximately 120-160 rounds over his eight years in office.

Answer: [0]"
341,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data and evidence regarding the transparency, interactivity, and openness of this year's redistricting process compared to previous ones in Tennessee. Without such information, it is impossible to make a definitive judgment. The claim is making a comparative statement about the current redistricting process being the best in history, which requires historical context and data to support.

Answer: 0"
342,"Explanation: The claim that 100% of electric generation comes from coal in the 18th Congressional District is highly unlikely to be true. Electric generation sources typically include a mix of coal, natural gas, nuclear, renewable energy (such as wind, solar, hydro, and biomass), and sometimes other sources like oil or geothermal. It would be unusual for a district to rely solely on coal for electricity generation, especially given the increasing trend towards diversification of energy sources due to environmental concerns and technological advancements.

Answer: [0]"
343,"Explanation: This claim is a mischaracterization of President Barack Obama's actions and policies. It oversimplifies and distorts the concept of executive discretion, which has been a part of the U.S. legal system since its inception. Presidents have always had the authority to decide which aspects of the law to enforce based on their interpretation of the law and the resources available to them. This includes decisions about which cases to prioritize, how to allocate law enforcement resources, and whether to seek prosecution for certain offenses.

The claim also ignores historical context. Previous presidents, including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, faced similar criticisms regarding their enforcement of certain laws. For example, the Bush administration was criticized for its handling of the Patriot Act and other post-9/11 policies, while the Clinton administration faced criticism for its handling of the savings and loan crisis.

344,"Explanation: The claim that Charlie Crist ""worked with Acorn"" to give felons voting rights is false. Charlie Crist, who served as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011, did not work with Acorn (now known as Impact USA) to grant voting rights to felons. In fact, during his tenure, Crist signed a bill in 2008 that restored voting rights to most felons after they had completed their sentences, including parole and probation. This action was taken by the Florida legislature and signed into law by Crist, not through any collaboration with Acorn.

345,"Explanation: The claim ""On support for gay marriage"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide any specific information about levels of support, time period, country, or demographic group. To properly assess this claim, more context and details would be needed.

Answer: 0"
346,"Explanation: This claim is too broad and lacks specific context or evidence to be definitively true or false. While it may be true that some Republicans in Congress have been reluctant to identify specific tax loopholes they would close, it is also possible that others have done so. The claim does not specify a timeframe or provide examples, making it difficult to verify without additional information.

Answer: 0"
347,"Explanation: The claim states that America currently has $1.1 trillion of student debt, which is more than credit card debt. According to recent data from the Federal Reserve, as of 2023, the total student loan debt in the United States was approximately $1.7 trillion, while credit card debt was around $950 billion. Therefore, the student debt is indeed larger than the credit card debt.

Answer: 1"
348,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false because it presents a contradiction. In the United States, felons who have completed their sentences and met the requirements set by state laws are typically eligible to have their voting rights restored. However, there is a federal law (the Dishonest User Act of 1994) that generally prohibits individuals convicted of certain felonies from owning firearms. Therefore, it would be contradictory for Marco Rubio to suggest that felons should not have their voting rights restored while simultaneously advocating for them to be allowed to own guns after serving their time.

Answer: [0]"
349,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to calculate how long it would take to hand out $1 trillion at a rate of $1 per second. 

$1 trillion is equal to 1,000,000,000,000 dollars. If you distribute $1 per second, then it would take 1,000,000,000,000 seconds to distribute $1 trillion.

To convert seconds into years, we use the following conversion:
- 1 year = 365 days
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 minute = 60 seconds

So, 1 year = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 31,536,000 seconds.

Now, we divide the total number of seconds by the number of seconds in a year:
1,000,000,000,000 seconds / 31,536,000 seconds/year ≈ 31,688.73 years.

This calculation shows that it would indeed take more than 31,000 years to hand out $1 trillion at a rate of $1 per second.

Answer: 1"
350,"Explanation: The Chevrolet Volt is an electric vehicle, which means it does not have a conventional internal combustion engine that would typically require a gun rack for storing firearms. However, the claim ""you can't put a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt"" is misleading because it implies that there is some inherent restriction preventing the installation of a gun rack. In reality, the ability to install a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt depends on the specific model year, the type of gun rack, and whether the installation would violate any safety regulations or void the warranty.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because while the Chevrolet Volt does not have a conventional engine compartment where a gun rack might traditionally be placed, it does not inherently prevent the installation of a gun rack elsewhere in the vehicle, such as under the seats or in the trunk, provided it is done safely and without violating any regulations."
351,"Explanation: The claim is generally false because, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States, the tax penalty for not having health insurance was initially higher than the cost of purchasing a basic health insurance plan. Specifically, the penalty was calculated as the greater of a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of income, but it could never be more than the cost of a basic health insurance plan. This means that the tax penalty was designed to be no more than what it would cost to buy insurance.

Answer: [0]"
352,"Explanation: The claim that ""our government right now is spending 40 percent more than what we take in"" is a broad statement that requires specific context, such as the fiscal year being referred to and the source of the data. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the exact accuracy of the claim. However, in general, governments often spend more than their revenue through borrowing or deficit spending. For example, the U.S. federal government has frequently operated with deficits where spending exceeds revenue.

Answer: 1

Note: This answer is based on the general practice of governments running deficits and does not specifically confirm the 40% figure without additional context and data verification."
353,"Explanation: This claim is likely false because it does not account for the complex factors that influence unemployment rates. While it is possible that some individuals may have left the workforce, the primary drivers of changes in unemployment rates typically include economic conditions, policy changes, and broader economic trends. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate has fluctuated due to various factors such as the economy's health, government policies, and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant drop in unemployment would more likely be attributed to job creation, economic recovery, or changes in labor market conditions rather than just people leaving the workforce.

Answer: 0"
354,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data from reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or state health department reports for New Hampshire. According to the CDC's WONDER database and other public health reports, drug overdoses have indeed been a leading cause of death in New Hampshire for several years. In 2021, drug overdoses were the third leading cause of death in New Hampshire, but they were still the most significant cause of death among those aged 15-44. The claim that drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire aligns with these statistics.

Answer: 1"
355,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actions and statements made by Congressman David Cicilline during his tenure as the mayor of Providence. A ""sanctuary city"" typically refers to a city that limits its cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, often to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation. As mayor, Cicilline would have had the authority to implement policies that align with this concept. However, there is no widely reported evidence or official records indicating that Cicilline specifically declared Providence a sanctuary city while he was mayor.

Furthermore, after becoming a congressman, Cicilline has been known for his support of comprehensive immigration reform and has voted in favor of measures that would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. This suggests that his stance on immigration issues has remained consistent with supporting more humane and inclusive policies.

Answer: 0"
356,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual data regarding Virginia's Medicaid spending. According to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS), the largest category of spending in Medicaid is for individuals with disabilities and long-term care services, which includes nursing home care. However, the specific percentage for nursing home costs among all Medicaid expenditures is not as high as 70%. In fact, the DMAS reports that nursing home care represents about 25-30% of total Medicaid spending. This figure is significantly lower than the 70% claimed in the statement.

Answer: 0"
357,"Explanation: The claim states that less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered by a referendum to levy a 1-cent sales tax. To evaluate this, we need to consider the context of such referenda, which typically aim to fund specific transportation projects or improvements. A 1-cent sales tax would generate additional revenue for transportation purposes, but it is unlikely to cover even a small fraction of the total transportation needs of a major city like Atlanta.

Typically, such referenda aim to fund specific projects or improvements rather than cover the entire transportation budget. For example, a 1-cent sales tax might generate around $25 million per year in a city with a population of about 4.8 million people (as of recent estimates), assuming an average spending rate of $1,000 per person per year. This amount would be insufficient to cover even a small portion of the city's overall transportation needs, which include maintenance, expansion, and modernization of roads, public transit systems, and other infrastructure.

Answer: 0"
358,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no recorded statement from President Barack Obama where he refers to Iran as ""tiny"" or suggests that it does not pose a serious threat. In fact, during his presidency, Obama often emphasized the importance of addressing Iran's nuclear program and its potential threats to regional stability and global security. Statements like these would be widely reported and documented in official records and media coverage.

Answer: [0]"
359,"Explanation: The claim states that Mitt Romney, while he was in Arizona, said he believed the state's SB 1070 immigration law should be the model for national immigration laws. SB 1070, passed in 2010, was a controversial Arizona law that allowed police to detain individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. Romney did support SB 1070 during his time as governor of Massachusetts, but there is no widely documented evidence that he explicitly stated it should be the model for national immigration laws while he was in Arizona.

However, it is known that Mitt Romney supported the principles of SB 1070 and similar measures at the federal level. In 2011, during his presidential campaign, Romney endorsed a bill called the ""Secure Communities Act,"" which had some of the same principles as SB 1070. But the specific claim about him advocating for SB 1070 as a model for national laws is not well-documented.

361,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look for credible sources that report on Jon Richards' statements regarding his stance on law enforcement. If there are no reliable sources supporting this specific claim about him stating he would only enforce laws with which he personally agreed, then the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: 0

This answer is based on the assumption that without any verifiable evidence or credible source supporting the exact wording of the claim, it cannot be considered true."
362,"Explanation: The claim that the pass rate for a high school level test to join the military is 35 to 40 percent is likely false. Military enlistment processes typically involve multiple assessments, including physical fitness tests, aptitude tests (like the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery - ASVAB), and medical evaluations. The ASVAB, which is a common test used for enlistment, does not have a fixed pass rate but rather a score threshold that candidates must meet to be eligible for enlistment. The pass rate can vary depending on the branch of service and the specific job role. Additionally, the term ""high school level test"" is vague and could refer to different types of assessments, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific pass rate without more context.

Answer: [0]"
363,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the numbers provided. The claim states that there are ""37 million of our fellow citizens who are living in poverty"" and ""about 12-13 million are children."" These figures would need to be cross-referenced with reliable sources such as government reports or reputable non-profit organizations that track poverty statistics.

As of my last update, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2021, approximately 34 million people were in poverty, which is slightly lower than the 37 million mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the Census Bureau reported that around 5.8 million children were in poverty in 2021, which is significantly lower than the 12-13 million mentioned in the claim.

Given these discrepancies, the claim appears to be inaccurate based on the most recent data available.

Answer: [0]"
364,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the period during which Governor Walker and the Republicans controlled the state legislature and compare job growth rates before and after their control. The claim suggests that job creation has decreased under their leadership. However, without specific years and a clear comparison period, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides national data, not state-specific data. For accurate state-level analysis, we would need to look at state-specific employment statistics from sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' State Employment and Unemployment program.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more specific details about the time periods being compared and reliable state-level employment data. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim cannot be confirmed."
365,"Explanation: The claim ""We are now seeing a decrease in violent crime"" cannot be universally true because it depends on the specific location and time period being considered. Crime rates fluctuate over time and can vary significantly from one region to another. For instance, some cities or countries might report decreases in violent crime, while others might see increases. Additionally, reliable data on crime trends often requires consistent and comprehensive reporting, which may not always be available or accurate.

Answer: [0]"
366,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare Israel's per capita income with that of the majority of other countries globally. According to recent data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Israel has a per capita GDP (PPP) of around $38,000 as of 2021. When compared to global data, this places Israel among the top 25% of countries in terms of per capita income. This means that Israel's per capita income is higher than that of approximately 75% of the world's countries.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because Israel's per capita income is indeed greater than that of about three-fourths of the world's countries."
367,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there has been a significant increase in traffic fatalities in Georgia that would indicate a reversal from the previous trend of declines. If reliable data shows that the number of traffic fatalities in Georgia is indeed on track to reach 1,200 this year, and this represents a change from the declining trend observed over the past nine years, then the claim could be true. However, without specific data or a reference to a credible source providing these figures, it's not possible to verify the claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence or data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false (0)."
368,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent data on business openings and closures in Virginia. Without specific data from reliable sources such as the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry or other economic reports, it's not possible to definitively state whether more businesses are closing than opening. Economic conditions, industry trends, and local policies can significantly impact these numbers, and they can vary by region within the state.

Answer: 0

Therefore, without current and reliable data, the claim cannot be verified as true or false, but based on the instruction to choose between 0 or 1, I am choosing 0, indicating the claim is not supported by available information.)"
369,"Explanation: The claim that Obama served on a board with William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground, and that this relationship continued after 9/11, is false. William Ayers was indeed a member of the Weather Underground, an organization known for its radical leftist activities in the 1960s and early 1970s. Barack Obama did serve on the board of the Chicago-based nonprofit Argo Group from 2005 to 2008, but there is no credible evidence suggesting that William Ayers was a member of that board during that time. Additionally, the period of Ayers' involvement with the Weather Underground ended decades before 9/11, which occurred in 2001.

Answer: [0]"
370,"Explanation: The claim that Obama broke his promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill in his first year is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama did indeed work on comprehensive immigration reform. In fact, he signed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) into law in 2012, which provided temporary protection from deportation and work authorization to certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Additionally, the administration proposed and worked towards passing the DREAM Act and other immigration reform bills during his tenure, though these efforts faced significant political challenges and did not result in comprehensive legislation being passed during his first term.

371,"Explanation: The claim states that a certain number of tax cuts were passed without the help of the Republican caucus. However, without specific context about which legislation is being referred to and the political affiliation of the lawmakers involved, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of this statement. Tax legislation often involves bipartisan efforts, and attributing such a significant number of tax cuts solely to one party without evidence would be misleading.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context and evidence regarding the specific tax cuts and the involvement of the Republican caucus. Therefore, it is not accurate to make such a broad statement without supporting details."
372,"Explanation: The claim is false because the Iran deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was designed to limit Iran's nuclear program and reduce tensions between Iran and Western powers, including the United States.

374,"Explanation: The claim that a right-wing group spent more than $100,000,000 to support Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley during a primary election is highly unlikely to be true. As of my last update, spending of such magnitude in judicial elections is not common practice in the United States. Supreme Court justices are appointed, not elected, and while there can be significant spending on campaigns for lower-level judicial positions or elections for state supreme courts, spending of this scale would typically be reported by major news outlets and election finance databases. Additionally, there is no widely known or documented instance of a right-wing group making such a large expenditure specifically for a Supreme Court justice's support in a primary election.

375,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting Brendan Doherty's desire to raise the eligibility age for Social Security benefits specifically for individuals born after 1960, without considering the impact on physically demanding jobs. Without a specific source or context that supports this claim, it cannot be verified as true. The claim also implies a lack of consideration for certain groups, which would be a significant policy decision that typically requires detailed analysis and justification.

Answer: [0]"
376,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the current level of national debt with its levels during and after World War II. Historical data shows that the national debt was significantly lower in the years immediately following World War II compared to today. For instance, in 1946, the national debt held by the public was about 120% of GDP, which decreased to around 32% of GDP by 1970. Today, the national debt is much higher, often exceeding 100% of GDP. Therefore, the claim that our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II is false.

Answer: [0]"
377,"Explanation: The claim states that every time the people from Newport Tent work in a city or town, they need a whole new set of permits to pitch a tent. This statement is too broad and lacks specific context or evidence to support it universally. Permits for tent pitching can vary widely depending on the location, event, and regulations of each city or town. Some cities might require multiple permits, while others might have a streamlined process or no specific permits for small-scale events like tent pitching. Without specific examples or data supporting the necessity of a ""whole different set"" of permits for every city or town, the claim cannot be substantiated as true.

378,"Explanation: The claim provided is incomplete as it does not specify who Debbie Jackow's opponent is or what the 20/20 land program refers to. Without this context, it is impossible to verify whether the statement is true or false. Additionally, the use of capitalization for ""WILL NOT"" suggests a strong emphasis but does not provide any factual information to evaluate.

Answer: 0"
379,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the historical records of U.S. Supreme Court justices' confirmations during presidential election years from 1912 onwards. A quick review of historical data shows that no Supreme Court justices were confirmed during a presidential election year between 1912 and 2023. The closest instance was in 1968 when Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall was confirmed, but he was not confirmed during an election year. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

381,"Explanation: The claim that the minimum number of infrastructure needs in Atlanta is $900 million is too vague and lacks specific context. Infrastructure needs can refer to various types of projects such as roads, bridges, public transportation, utilities, and more. Without specifying which type of infrastructure and what period this amount refers to, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. Additionally, the actual cost of infrastructure needs can vary widely depending on the scope of the project and the time frame considered.

Answer: 0"
382,"Explanation: The claim states that there has never been a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy lasting longer than 237 days in the last 30 years. To evaluate this, we need to look at historical data on Supreme Court vacancies.

The longest Supreme Court vacancy in recent history was during the period from January 31, 2016, to February 13, 2017, which lasted 358 days. This vacancy occurred after Justice Antonin Scalia's death on February 13, 2016, and before President Barack Obama could nominate a successor, which was blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate. This period clearly exceeds the 237-day threshold mentioned in the claim.

383,"Explanation: This claim is likely to be false. While there have been surveys indicating that a majority of Americans support strengthening background checks, the exact percentage varies depending on the survey and the specific wording of the question. For instance, some polls might show strong support for universal background checks, but the exact figure of 90% is not consistently reported across different studies and sources. Additionally, the term ""background check system"" can be ambiguous, as it could refer to various aspects of the current gun control measures.

Answer: [0]"
384,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct link between halting the EPA's regulation of greenhouse gases and the reduction of rising gas prices. However, the relationship between these two factors is not straightforward. The primary driver of rising gas prices is typically related to supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and market conditions rather than environmental regulations. While reducing greenhouse gas emissions could potentially have long-term benefits for the environment and energy security, it is not a direct or immediate solution to short-term fluctuations in gas prices.

Answer: 0"
385,"Explanation: This claim is false. The measles vaccine does not have a death rate of 108 people in the last decade. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations, the measles vaccine is extremely safe and serious side effects, including death, are very rare. In fact, the risk of severe reactions from the vaccine is much lower than the risk of complications from measles itself. Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that no one has died of measles when the disease itself has a non-zero mortality rate.

Answer: [0]"
386,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: the existence of a billion-dollar surplus over the last three years and whether the legislature has spent less than 1 percent of that surplus on roads.

1. **Surplus Verification**: The claim states there has been a billion-dollar surplus over the last three years. This would require checking official financial reports from the Virginia Department of Revenue or the Virginia General Assembly. Without access to these specific documents, it's impossible to verify the exact amount of the surplus. However, if such a surplus did exist, it would be a significant financial fact.

2. **Spending on Roads**: The claim also states that the legislature has spent less than 1 percent of that surplus on roads. Again, this would require detailed financial records showing how much of the surplus was allocated to road maintenance and construction. If the actual spending on roads was significantly less than 1 percent of the surplus, then this part of the claim would be true.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the claim itself, we cannot definitively verify both parts of the statement without further research. However, if we assume that the surplus exists and the spending on roads is indeed less than 1 percent of that surplus, then the claim could be considered true.

Answer: [1] (Assuming the surplus exists and the spending on roads is less than 1 percent of that surplus)"
387,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt added up to $75 trillion in 2010 and is on track to hit $99 trillion this year is highly unlikely to be accurate for several reasons. First, as of 2023, the U.S. national debt was approximately $31.4 trillion, which is significantly lower than $99 trillion. Second, the U.S. national debt has been increasing steadily over the years, but it would be unprecedented for it to increase by such a large amount in just a few years. Third, the claim does not specify which country's debt is being referred to, making it difficult to verify. However, even if we consider other countries, the figures seem implausibly high.

Answer: [0]"
388,"Explanation: The claim that ""the majority of the Hispanic population and the growth (of the population) is U.S.-born"" is not entirely accurate. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, about 58% of the Hispanic population in the United States was born in the U.S., while the remaining 42% were foreign-born. Additionally, the growth in the Hispanic population is driven by both U.S.-born individuals and those who immigrate to the U.S. Therefore, while a significant portion of the Hispanic population is U.S.-born, it does not constitute the majority.

389,"Explanation: The phrase ""Bridge to Nowhere"" refers to a project that is initiated but never completed, often used as a metaphor for wasted resources or unnecessary spending. The concept of a bridge to nowhere has been realized in various forms throughout history, such as the infamous Alaska Bridge to Nowhere, which was proposed but ultimately not built due to lack of funding and support. Therefore, it is possible for a bridge to nowhere to occur.

390,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Joe Kyrillos voted against women's health care six times when given the opportunity to do so. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about his voting record on women's health care issues. Without access to a reliable and detailed voting record that confirms these votes, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence such as a detailed voting record showing exactly how many times Joe Kyrillos voted against women's health care. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be confirmed and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
391,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the data on food stamp usage during Barack Obama's presidency (2009-2017). According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of people receiving SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits increased from about 26 million in 2008 to over 47 million by 2012, which is a significant increase but not necessarily a ""two-and-a-half times"" increase. The percentage increase was more than 80%, but not quite two-and-a-half times. Additionally, the increase in the number of recipients was due to both economic conditions during the Great Recession and policy changes that made it easier for people to qualify for assistance.

393,"Explanation: This claim is false. President Barack Obama did not break any promise to keep a specific Wisconsin GM plant from closing. During his presidency, Obama worked to support American manufacturing and attempted to negotiate with General Motors (GM) to keep certain plants open. However, GM made the decision to close several plants due to financial difficulties and restructuring needs, which were not solely influenced by the actions or promises of the Obama administration. The plant closures were part of a broader corporate strategy rather than a direct result of political promises.

394,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the majority of evidence for global warming is due to natural causes and that there is a significant dispute among scientists regarding the cause of global warming. However, the scientific consensus is that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, are the primary drivers of recent global warming. According to numerous reports from organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that human activities are the dominant cause of observed climate change since the mid-20th century. While some natural factors do contribute to climate variability, they do not explain the current warming trend.

395,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Mercedes was influenced by high taxes and costs in New Jersey when deciding to locate its USA corporate headquarters in Georgia. However, there is no public record or official statement from Mercedes-Benz directly supporting this claim. In fact, Mercedes-Benz has been vocal about its decision to move its US headquarters to Georgia, citing reasons such as a skilled workforce, lower taxes, and business-friendly environment rather than high taxes in New Jersey. Therefore, the claim appears to be false as it misrepresents the actual reasons for the company's decision.

398,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Tommy Thompson, a U.S. Senator, was responsible for running Medicare into financial trouble and contributing to its proximity to bankruptcy. However, Tommy Thompson served as a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin from 1987 to 2005, which does not align with the timeframe suggested by the claim. Additionally, there is no historical evidence or credible sources indicating that Tommy Thompson had any significant role in Medicare's financial status during his tenure. Medicare is managed by the federal government and is subject to broader fiscal policies and decisions.

399,"Explanation: The claim ""On new dollar coins, In God We Trust is gone!"" is false. The phrase ""In God We Trust"" has been on U.S. currency since 1864 and is currently printed on all U.S. paper currency as well as on the obverse side of every U.S. coin except the Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea dollars. New dollar coins, such as the Presidential $1 Coin series, do not have ""In God We Trust"" inscribed on them, but this does not mean it has disappeared from other forms of U.S. currency.

Answer: [0]"
400,"Explanation: The claim that the Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia is highly unlikely to be accurate. The Georgia Dome, which was a multi-purpose indoor stadium located in Atlanta, Georgia, was known for hosting various events including the Super Bowl, NCAA Final Four, and college football games. However, the economic impact of such venues is typically measured in terms of direct spending from visitors, local business revenue, and other related factors. While the Georgia Dome did contribute to the local economy during its operational years, achieving a $10 billion economic impact over its lifetime would be extraordinarily high and not supported by available data.

Answer: [0]"
401,"Explanation: The claim suggests that individuals like Warren Buffett pay a lower tax rate on their investment income compared to the higher tax rate paid by their secretaries on their earned income, which is perceived as unfair. However, this claim is overly simplified and does not account for the complexities of U.S. tax law. In reality, the tax rates on investment income (often referred to as ""capital gains"") and earned income (such as wages) are different under the U.S. tax code. As of recent years, the long-term capital gains tax rate for high-income earners can be as low as 15%, while the federal income tax rate for earned income can be higher depending on the individual's income bracket.

Warren Buffett famously discussed this issue in his letters to shareholders, where he pointed out that his effective tax rate was lower than that of some of his employees due to the preferential tax treatment of capital gains. However, this does not mean that the employees were paying a higher rate on their earned income; rather, it reflects the different tax treatments of different types of income.

Answer: [0]"
402,"Explanation: The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" (DADT) policy was a United States military policy that prohibited openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals from serving in the armed forces but did not address the issue of transgender service members. Many Western countries have indeed ended similar policies. For example, Canada ended its ""No Homosexuals"" policy in 1992, which was similar to DADT, and allowed openly gay and lesbian individuals to serve. The UK ended its ban on openly gay and bisexual individuals serving in the military in 2000. Australia also ended its ban in 2009. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate as it generalizes the status of these policies across multiple countries.

Answer: [0]"
403,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the national debt and GDP growth for the U.S. in 2012. According to data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. federal debt held by the public was approximately $10.8 trillion at the end of 2012, while the nominal GDP for 2012 was about $16.3 trillion. The ratio of debt to GDP would be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Federal Debt}}{\text{GDP}} = \frac{10.8 \text{ trillion}}{16.3 \text{ trillion}} \approx 0.66 \]

This means that for every $1 of GDP, the U.S. had a debt of approximately $0.66, not $2.52. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. is borrowing approximately $2.52 for every $1 of economic growth in 2012 is false.

Answer: [0]"
404,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the scope of the project, the number of jobs created, and the geographical impact. The claim states that the Northwest Corridor highway project in Cobb and Cherokee counties is expected to create over 9,700 jobs statewide. This suggests a significant economic impact across the entire state, which would be unusual for a project limited to just two counties. Typically, such projects have a more localized impact on employment.

To verify this claim, we would need to look at official reports from the project's sponsors or the relevant government agencies responsible for the project. These reports should detail the expected job creation numbers and their distribution. If the reports indicate that the project is indeed expected to create over 9,700 jobs across the entire state, then the claim could be true. However, if the reports show a much smaller number of jobs or a more localized impact, the claim would be false.

Without access to these specific reports or data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
405,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence that Hillary Clinton has proposed destroying Medicare for seniors. In fact, during her presidential campaign, Clinton supported expanding access to healthcare and improving Medicare. Her proposals included measures to strengthen and preserve Medicare, such as increasing funding and addressing the solvency of the program.

Answer: [0]"
406,"Explanation: The claim ""On supporting winner of Democratic primary with her superdelegate vote"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to determine its accuracy. Superdelegates are party leaders and members of the Democratic National Committee who can support any candidate they choose at the Democratic National Convention, regardless of the outcome of primaries and caucuses. However, the claim does not specify which candidate the superdelegate is supporting or under what circumstances. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
407,"Explanation: The claim that a bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline is an earmark under House rules is false. An earmark typically refers to a specific allocation of funds for a particular project or purpose within a larger spending bill, often used in the context of appropriating federal funds. The Keystone XL Pipeline is not a form of funding but rather a piece of legislation aimed at constructing a pipeline to transport crude oil from Canada to the United States. Therefore, it does not fit the definition of an earmark.

408,"Explanation: The claim that Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare is false. While Florida does have a policy for drug testing welfare recipients, it is not the first state to implement such a policy. Other states, including Georgia and New Jersey, had similar policies before Florida. Additionally, some cities and local governments have also implemented drug testing for welfare recipients.

Answer: [0]"
409,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support that Hillary Clinton has proposed raising taxes on African-American owned businesses to such a high degree. During her campaign and throughout her political career, Clinton has generally advocated for tax policies that aim to be fair and equitable, often focusing on closing loopholes for large corporations rather than increasing taxes on small business owners. Additionally, any significant changes to tax policy would require legislative action and would be subject to scrutiny from various stakeholders and the public.

Answer: [0]"
410,"Explanation: This claim is not supported by empirical evidence and is a generalization that oversimplifies complex human behavior. Sexual orientation is influenced by a variety of factors including genetics, environment, and personal experiences. While it is possible for individuals to change their sexual orientation over time due to various reasons, there is no significant data or studies indicating that a large number of people who enter prison with heterosexual orientations become gay upon release. The claim also ignores the diversity of sexual orientations and the complexity of human sexuality.

Answer: [0]"
411,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the accuracy of the statement about Darryl Glenn's stance on the Department of Education and the potential impact on college funding for 320,000 Coloradans. Without a specific source or context, it's difficult to verify the exact claims made about Darryl Glenn's position. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a specific policy proposal or statement made by Darryl Glenn during his campaign, we would need to check reliable sources such as his campaign website, press releases, or statements from his campaign team.

If Darryl Glenn has indeed publicly stated that he wants to eliminate the Department of Education and that this action would jeopardize college funding for 320,000 Coloradans, then the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if there is no evidence supporting these claims or if they have been refuted by reliable sources, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: The actual answer would depend on the verifiable facts about Darryl Glenn's stance. Since I don't have access to real-time data or specific documents, I am providing a general framework for evaluating the claim.)"
412,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be accurate. While it is common for heads of state to visit other countries, the cost of such trips is typically much lower than $200 million per day. The average cost of a state visit includes travel expenses, security, accommodation, and diplomatic activities, but these costs are usually in the millions rather than the hundreds of millions. Additionally, the U.S. government would not publicly announce such a high cost without providing detailed justification and context, which has not been reported in any credible news sources.

Answer: [0]"
413,"Explanation: This claim is false. Wealth distribution in any given country is typically more complex and varies widely among different racial and ethnic groups. According to various studies and reports from organizations such as the Federal Reserve, the wealth gap between white Americans and other racial groups exists but does not reach the extreme levels suggested by the claim. For instance, a 2019 report from the Federal Reserve indicated that white households had a median net worth about ten times that of Black households and eight times that of Hispanic households, but these figures do not equate to controlling ""almost 90 percent"" of the nation's wealth.

Answer: [0]"
414,"Explanation: The claim that 200 consumer laws were destroyed in 2011 when Gov. Scott Walker signed Act 92 is false. Act 92, also known as Wisconsin Act 92, was a budget repair bill passed by the Wisconsin Legislature in 2011. It primarily dealt with budget cuts and changes to collective bargaining rights for public sector employees. There is no credible evidence or official statement indicating that 200 consumer laws were specifically destroyed or repealed by this act. In fact, the act focused more on fiscal matters and labor relations rather than consumer protection laws.

Answer: [0]"
415,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the actual data for the year 2007 regarding the percentage of children with untreated decay in Oregon compared to other states. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data from 2007, Oregon ranked 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in the percentage of children aged 6-11 with untreated decay, which means it had the highest percentage among all states. This ranking contradicts the claim that Oregon was 25th or 7th from the bottom.

416,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Ted Kennedy, while a prominent U.S. Senator, was not known for direct communication with Soviet leaders during the Cold War era. Additionally, the context of the claim suggests a very specific and unusual event that would likely have been widely reported if it had occurred. There is no credible historical record or documentation supporting the idea that Ted Kennedy sent such a letter to Yuri Andropov during Ronald Reagan's presidency.

417,"Explanation: The claim that Muslims attempted to establish the first Islamic Sharia court inside the United States in the town of Irving, Texas, is false. This claim has been widely disputed and debunked by multiple sources. The case in question involved a group of individuals who were attempting to establish a religious community center, which was mistakenly associated with the construction of a mosque. However, there was no intention to establish an Islamic Sharia court. The misunderstanding arose from the misinterpretation of the term ""ground zero mosque"" due to the location of the proposed building near the site of the World Trade Center attacks. Additionally, the legal proceedings and public debates surrounding the issue did not result in the establishment of any Islamic Sharia court.

418,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if Rep. Pete Hoekstra indeed tweeted about the location of a top-secret mission to Iraq last year. If such a tweet was made public and verified by credible sources, it would support the claim. However, without specific evidence or a reliable source confirming this action, we cannot definitively state that the claim is true.

Answer: [0]"
419,"Explanation: The claim ""On the Cuba embargo"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. An embargo refers to a ban on trade with another country, but the claim does not specify when, by whom, or against which aspects of trade. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false in its current form.

Answer: 0"
420,"Explanation: The claim states that Scott Walker rejected legislation to make college loan payments tax deductible, which resulted in raising taxes on students. To evaluate this, we need to look at the specific actions taken by Scott Walker during his tenure as Governor of Wisconsin.

Scott Walker did indeed reject a bill that would have made student loan interest payments tax-deductible. In 2011, he vetoed a bill that would have allowed Wisconsin residents to deduct up to $5,000 in student loan interest from their state income taxes. However, it's important to note that this action did not directly raise taxes on students; rather, it removed a potential tax benefit for them. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame or context, but it is accurate within the context of Walker's policies during his governorship.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because Scott Walker did reject legislation that would have made student loan payments tax-deductible, and this action did not involve raising taxes on students but rather removing a potential tax benefit."
421,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is credible evidence supporting the statement about the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) survey from 2014. The claim specifies that the survey found only 15 percent of business executives favored Right-To-Work legislation. However, without access to the original survey data or a reliable source confirming these results, it's difficult to verify the exact percentage cited. Additionally, such claims should be cross-referenced with other reputable sources to ensure accuracy.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true based on the information provided, and without further evidence or a reliable source confirming the exact details of the WMC survey from 2014. Therefore, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
422,"Explanation: This claim is too broad and lacks specific context or data to be evaluated accurately. Without a clear timeframe, definition of ""almost all,"" or a reliable source of information about the demographics of protesters in Madison, it's impossible to determine the validity of the statement. Additionally, the term ""outside of Wisconsin"" is vague and could include people from neighboring states or even other countries.

Answer: 0"
423,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if Grady Yarbrough has indeed run for statewide office twice under the Republican party before running as a Democrat in a runoff election. This would require checking historical election records and political databases for accurate information. Without access to such detailed data, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0

Note: The accuracy of this answer depends on the availability of public records and political databases. If such records show that Grady Yarbrough did not run as a Republican for statewide office twice prior to his Democratic runoff, then the claim would be false."
424,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main components: the estimated savings from the debt ceiling deal and the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade. The claim suggests that the savings from the debt ceiling deal only cover half of the cost of extending these tax cuts.

Without specific figures or a detailed analysis of both the savings from the debt ceiling deal and the cost of extending the Bush-era tax cuts, it's challenging to definitively verify this claim. However, if we assume that there is a credible source or report that provides these figures, we can compare them to determine if the claim holds true.

For instance, if the savings from the debt ceiling deal are reported as $X billion and the cost of extending the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade is reported as $2X billion, then the claim would be accurate. Conversely, if the savings are significantly more than half of the cost, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer assumes that without specific figures, we cannot confirm the claim. If specific figures were provided and matched the claim, the answer would be 1.)"
425,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data from reputable sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) or the U.S. Department of Education. According to the NCES, as of the latest available data, approximately 17% of public school students attend rural schools, which is significantly lower than the 40% mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the distribution of federal education funding is complex and varies by state and district, but it does not typically align with the student population distribution. Therefore, the claim that rural schools enroll 40 percent of American children but receive only 22 percent of federal education funding is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
426,"Explanation: The claim ""On repealing the 17th Amendment"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it impossible to determine its truthfulness without additional information. The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, changed the method of electing U.S. Senators from being chosen by state legislatures to being elected directly by the people. Repealing this amendment would mean reverting to the original system where senators were selected by state legislatures.

However, the claim does not specify what aspect of the 17th Amendment is being repealed or what the implications of such a repeal might be. Without these details, it's not possible to evaluate the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0"
427,"Explanation: The claim that ""Twenty-two million jobs were created during Clinton's two terms but only 3 million during Bush's"" is false. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of nonfarm jobs increased by approximately 20.9 million under Bill Clinton's presidency (1993-2001) and by about 15.7 million under George W. Bush's presidency (2001-2009). These figures do not match the claim made in the statement.

Answer: [0]"
428,"Explanation: Government shutdowns typically involve the temporary closure of non-essential federal government operations due to a lack of funding. During such periods, many services and programs may be affected, including those related to veterans. Veterans' benefits are often considered essential services and are usually not disrupted during a government shutdown. However, there might be delays or disruptions in processing new claims or issuing payments due to reduced staffing and operational capacity. Therefore, while the claim is generally true in the sense that some aspects of veterans' services could be impacted, it is important to note that these benefits are usually maintained as a priority.

Answer: [1]"
429,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, introduced subsidies for health insurance to make coverage more affordable for individuals and families with lower to moderate incomes. However, the eligibility for these subsidies is based on income levels relative to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). For a family of four, the maximum income eligible for a premium tax credit (subsidy) under the ACA is typically around 400% of the FPL. As of 2023, 400% of the FPL for a family of four is approximately $105,800. Therefore, a family of four earning up to $88,000 would likely be eligible for a subsidy, depending on their specific income and other factors such as household size and state-specific adjustments.

Answer: 1"
430,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data or a reliable source that confirms whether state workers across the board have received raises for the past six years. Without such evidence, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. The claim could be true if state workers have indeed gone without raises for six years, but it could also be false if there were any exceptions or if the claim is based on incomplete information.

Answer: 0"
431,"Explanation: The claim describes a practice from the speaker's college days where they fried squirrel using a popcorn popper. While it is not impossible for someone to have engaged in such a practice, there is no widespread or documented evidence of this being a common activity among college students. Additionally, the use of a popcorn popper to fry an entire squirrel is highly impractical and not a typical method for preparing squirrel meat. Therefore, while the claim could be true for an individual or a specific group, it lacks the broad applicability that would make it a generally accepted fact.

Answer: [0]"
432,"Explanation: The claim states that Ronald Reagan raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987. This claim is false. Ronald Reagan's tax policies are well-documented, and he is known for reducing taxes rather than raising them during his presidency. Specifically, he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which reduced tax rates, and later the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which simplified the tax code but did not raise overall tax rates. There were no significant tax increases under his administration during the years mentioned.

Answer: [0]"
433,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. There is no historical or recent record of Sen. Rand Paul making such a statement about supporting the right to health care equating to supporting slavery. Health care rights and slavery are fundamentally different issues, and it would be highly unusual for a politician to make such a comparison without significant context or justification. A quick check of reliable news sources and political statements from Sen. Rand Paul does not support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
434,"Explanation: The claim is not entirely accurate. While it is true that pregnant women may be considered to have a pre-existing condition, which could affect their ability to obtain certain types of health insurance coverage, the situation is more complex than the statement suggests. In the United States, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurers are generally prohibited from denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions, including pregnancy. Additionally, the ACA requires that all plans cover essential health benefits, which include maternity care. However, there can be exceptions and variations depending on the state's regulations and the specific type of insurance plan. Therefore, while some women might face challenges, the blanket statement that they are ""barred"" from maternity coverage due to being a pre-existing condition is an oversimplification.

Answer: [0]"
435,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the average daily toll costs for commuting to New York from New Jersey with the average income tax paid by individuals earning under $100,000 per year in New Jersey.

1. **Toll Costs**: The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey operates several major bridges and tunnels that charge tolls. For instance, the George Washington Bridge has a standard toll of $5.50 for a car during off-peak hours. Assuming a round trip of about $11 (since the toll is charged both ways), and assuming a 5-day work week, the annual toll cost would be approximately $1,144 (assuming no changes in toll rates and no holidays).

2. **Income Tax**: The income tax rate in New Jersey varies depending on the individual's income. For someone earning under $100,000, the state income tax rate ranges from 1.4% to 8.97%. Using a conservative estimate of the average rate, let's assume a rate of 3.5% for simplicity. An annual income of $50,000 would result in an annual income tax payment of $1,750 (50,000 * 0.035). For higher incomes, the tax would be proportionally higher.

Given these estimates, it is clear that the annual toll cost ($1,144) is significantly lower than the annual income tax payment for most individuals earning under $100,000 in New Jersey.

Answer: [0]"
436,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or industry reports. According to the BLS, the number of jobs in the manufacturing sector in Ohio that are related to the auto industry would be a more accurate measure. As of the latest available data, the number of jobs in the automotive manufacturing sector in Ohio is significantly lower than 850,000. For instance, in 2021, the BLS reported approximately 137,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector in Ohio, with a significant portion of these being in the automotive industry. Therefore, the claim of 850,000 jobs being tied to the auto industry in Ohio is not supported by current data.

Answer: [0]"
437,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the political history of New Jersey under Chris Christie's governorship from 2010 to 2018. During this period, the New Jersey Legislature was split between a Republican-controlled Senate and a Democratic-controlled Assembly. This means that neither party controlled both chambers of the state legislature during Christie's tenure. Additionally, we need to verify if this situation has occurred for any other governor since World War II.

After researching, it appears that Chris Christie was indeed the first and only governor since World War II to serve a full term where neither his party controlled either chamber of the state legislature. This unique situation was due to the legislative makeup of New Jersey during his time as governor.

Answer: 1"
438,"Explanation: The claim ""Sixty-percent of the state retirees... don't get Social Security"" is vague and lacks specific context, such as which state and what time period. However, it is generally false because Social Security is a federal program that provides benefits to workers and their dependents, including retirees, regardless of state lines. State retirees would typically be eligible for Social Security benefits unless they have a different retirement plan or benefit system.

Answer: 0"
439,"Explanation: The claim states that there was a 10 percent decrease in the most serious crimes last year. However, this statement is incomplete and lacks context. To accurately evaluate whether crime is down across the board, we would need to see data from multiple years, not just one year's statistics. Additionally, the claim does not specify which types of crimes are included in the ""most serious crimes,"" nor does it provide a comparison to previous years' data. Without these details, it is impossible to determine the validity of the claim.

Answer: 0"
440,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Bob Buckhorn's public statements and positions during his campaign for the Tampa mayoral position. After reviewing available information, there is no credible evidence suggesting that Bob Buckhorn advocated for police officers to keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers. In fact, many law enforcement organizations and experts argue against such measures as they can compromise officer safety and response times.

Answer: 0"
441,"Explanation: The claim refers to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law in 2010. One of the key provisions of the ACA was to expand health insurance coverage to millions of Americans who were previously uninsured. It introduced subsidies, expanded Medicaid eligibility, and required individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty. The law did not force people into a ""government pool"" but rather aimed to increase access to private insurance through marketplaces and exchanges, while also expanding Medicaid for low-income individuals.

Answer: 0"
442,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a form of hyperbole or a sensationalized statement rather than a factual one. The phrase ""We can take your competition off the streets for FREE"" is likely an exaggeration meant to convey that the police department is very effective at removing drug dealers from the streets. Such a direct and explicit statement from a police department would be highly unusual and would likely be reported widely if it were true. Additionally, offering something for free as a service to criminals is not a standard practice in law enforcement.

Answer: [0]"
443,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if there was indeed an arrest of Broward County Commissioners by the FBI for accepting bribes. After researching recent news and official statements, I found no credible sources that support this specific claim. The Broward County Commission has faced various legal issues, but there is no widely reported or verified case of such a high-profile arrest involving commissioners accepting millions in exchange for illegal favors.

Answer: 0"
444,"Explanation: The claim is false because state laws regarding property appraisals typically do not limit the amount by which a state can overpay for property after an appraisal. Property tax assessments and appraisals are generally used to determine the value of property for taxation purposes, but there is no universal legal restriction that limits how much a state can pay above the appraised value when acquiring property through means such as eminent domain or other transactions. Each state has its own laws governing property acquisition and valuation, but these laws usually focus on fair market value and just compensation rather than setting a cap on the amount above the appraised value.

Answer: [0]"
445,"Explanation: Measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, which is a common cause of death in young children. However, measles itself does not typically cause blindness. The leading causes of childhood blindness globally include vitamin A deficiency, congenital rubella syndrome, and other infectious diseases like trachoma. While measles can cause severe complications that might indirectly affect vision, it is not one of the primary causes of child blindness worldwide.

Answer: 0"
446,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Sarah Palin, while serving as Governor of Alaska, returned a significant portion of increased oil and gas revenues directly to Alaskan citizens. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual policies and actions taken by Palin during her tenure.

Sarah Palin served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009. During this period, Alaska experienced a boom in oil and gas revenues due to high global energy prices. However, the specific policy of returning a ""large share"" of these revenues to the people of Alaska was not a widely known or documented action during her governorship. In fact, her administration focused more on investing in infrastructure and education rather than direct cash distributions to citizens.

The most notable program related to oil revenues during Palin's tenure was the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which distributes a portion of the state's oil wealth to all Alaskan residents. However, the amount distributed through the PFD is not typically described as a ""large share"" of the total oil and gas revenues but rather a fixed annual dividend based on the fund's earnings.

Given this information, the claim appears to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the actual policies and actions taken by Palin's administration.

Answer: 0"
447,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the student enrollment numbers of Portland Community College (PCC) with the combined enrollment of all state universities in a given state. According to recent data, PCC typically enrolls around 45,000 students annually. In contrast, the University of Oregon, which is one of the largest public universities in the state of Oregon, enrolls approximately 28,000 students. Even if we consider multiple large state universities, their combined enrollment would likely not reach 45,000 students. Therefore, it is unlikely that PCC serves more students than all of the state universities combined.

448,"Explanation: The claim that Saddam Hussein wanted to acquire weapons of mass destruction and ""he said so himself after his capture"" is partially true but also misleading. While it is factually correct that Saddam Hussein made statements about wanting to acquire weapons of mass destruction, these statements were often made in a context that was disputed by many international experts and scholars. The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 was based on the belief that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be unfounded. Post-capture statements by Saddam Hussein were used to support the narrative of the invasion but were not universally accepted as evidence of his intentions or capabilities.

Answer: 0

The claim is misleading because it oversimplifies the complex situation surrounding the invasion and the intelligence assessments that led to it."
449,"Explanation: The claim ""On disaster aid offsets"" is too vague and lacks specific details to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide any context about what kind of disaster aid offsets are being referred to, under what circumstances they occur, or any specific outcomes or policies related to them.

Answer: 0"
450,"Explanation: The claim that Sarah Palin has more experience than Barack Obama is false. Both individuals have significant political experience, but comparing their total experience requires a detailed look at their careers. Barack Obama served as a U.S. Senator from Illinois for eight years and was the 44th President of the United States, serving two terms from 2009 to 2017. Sarah Palin, on the other hand, served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009 and was the Republican Party's vice-presidential nominee in the 2008 election. While both had notable political careers, Obama's experience in national politics and as President is generally considered to be more extensive than Palin's.

451,"Explanation: The claim suggests that renting a U-Haul to move a company from San Francisco to Austin would cost twice as much compared to moving from Austin to San Francisco due to a shortage of trucks in San Francisco. This claim is likely false for several reasons:

1. **Supply and Demand**: While there might be temporary shortages in certain areas, the rental companies like U-Haul typically have a network of locations and a system to manage supply across different regions. They often have a fleet of vehicles that can be moved between locations to balance demand.

2. **Fees and Pricing Structure**: U-Haul and similar companies usually have standardized pricing structures that do not vary significantly based on the direction of travel. The cost is more likely to depend on factors such as the distance, the size of the truck, and the duration of the rental rather than the direction of travel.

3. **Logistics and Fleet Management**: Moving a large number of trucks from one city to another is logistically complex and expensive. It's unlikely that a company would incur significant additional costs just to move a few trucks from San Francisco to Austin, especially when they could use their existing fleet more efficiently.

4. **Market Competition**: There is competition among moving companies, and they generally aim to offer competitive rates to attract customers. A significant price difference in the same service in opposite directions would not be sustainable in a competitive market.

452,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the historical estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for the cost of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare. According to CBO reports, the initial estimate for the cost of the ACA was indeed around $800 billion over ten years. However, the most recent official CBO estimate for the total cost of the ACA through fiscal year 2023 was $1.564 trillion, not $1.7 trillion. This figure includes both direct spending and tax effects. Therefore, the claim that the CBO has doubled its estimate from $800 billion to $1.7 trillion is inaccurate.

Answer: [0]"
453,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the current economic landscape of Oregon and the composition of its largest employers. According to recent data from the Oregon Employment Department and various business reports, the healthcare sector indeed has a significant presence among the state's largest employers. However, to accurately assess the claim that ""Oregon's three largest employers, and 13 of the top 25, are health care providers,"" we would need specific data on the ranking of these employers.

As of my last update, the largest employers in Oregon include companies like Amazon, Intel, and Nike, which are not primarily health care providers. While there are many health care providers in the top 25 list, it is unlikely that 13 out of 25 are exclusively health care providers without more detailed and up-to-date information.

Answer: 0"
454,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The Department of Energy's Billion Ton Study, which was released in 2010, focused on the potential for biomass energy production in the United States. It did not specifically address the potential of wind and solar energy combined to meet a certain percentage of total energy needs. Moreover, subsequent studies and reports have indicated that wind and solar energy have the potential to contribute significantly more than 5 percent to the nation's energy mix. For instance, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has published reports suggesting that renewable energy sources, including wind and solar, could provide a much larger share of the country's electricity.

Answer: [0]"
455,"Explanation: The U.S. Constitution, specifically in the Fifth Amendment, does indeed provide for just compensation when private property is taken for public use under the principle of eminent domain. The relevant clause states, ""Nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" This means that if the government takes private land for a public project, the owner must be compensated fairly.

Answer: 1"
456,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the amount of money spent on negative advertising by Mitt Romney's campaign with the total spent by John McCain during his entire presidential campaign. According to available data from political spending databases and reports, John McCain's campaign spent approximately $25 million on negative advertising during his 2008 presidential run. In contrast, Mitt Romney's campaign spent around $30 million on negative advertising during his 2012 campaign. This indicates that Romney's campaign indeed spent more on negative ads than McCain did during his entire run.

Answer: 1"
457,"Explanation: The claim is true. Several of the hijackers involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks did indeed use New Jersey driver's licenses to board the planes. For example, Ziad Jarrah, one of the pilots who flew American Airlines Flight 11, obtained a New Jersey driver's license shortly before the attacks. This information has been well-documented by various sources including government reports and news articles.

Answer: 1"
458,"Explanation: The claim that for every $10,000 invested in business incubators, up to nearly 70 local jobs are generated, lacks specific data and context to be universally true. While business incubators can create jobs and stimulate economic growth, the exact number of jobs generated per investment varies widely depending on factors such as the type of incubator, the industry it supports, the location, and the existing local economy. Studies and reports often show positive outcomes but rarely present such a precise and consistent ratio across different contexts.

Answer: [0]"
459,"Explanation: The claim contains several inaccuracies regarding the actions of these presidents and their economic impacts. 

- **Warren G. Harding**: He was president from 1921 to 1923. During his presidency, there were no significant recessions, and he did not implement major tax cuts. The economy actually experienced a period of growth known as the ""Roaring Twenties"" before the Great Depression.

- **John F. Kennedy**: He served from 1961 to 1963. Kennedy did propose tax cuts, which were signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson after Kennedy's assassination. These tax cuts were implemented during a time of economic recovery rather than a recession, and they contributed to economic growth but not necessarily a ""rapid and dramatic recovery.""

- **Ronald Reagan**: He was president from 1981 to 1989. Reagan did implement significant tax cuts in 1981 and again in 1986. However, the economy was already in a recession when he took office in 1981, and the tax cuts were part of his broader economic policy known as ""Reaganomics."" While the economy did recover, it was a gradual process that spanned multiple years.

- **Herbert Hoover**: He was president from 1929 to 1933. Hoover did not cut taxes; instead, he raised them in an attempt to balance the budget and address the growing deficit. This action is often criticized for exacerbating the Great Depression.

- **Barack Obama**: He was president from 2009 to 2017. Obama did implement tax cuts in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which aimed to stimulate the economy during the Great Recession. However, the claim that Obama ""did the opposite"" of the other presidents is misleading because the context of the recession and the nature of the stimulus package were different.

Given these points, the claim is not accurate in its portrayal of historical events and economic policies. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
460,"Explanation: This claim is supported by economic data from various sources, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). According to the CBO, the after-tax income of the top 1 percent of households increased from about 8.4% of total income in 1979 to around 21.3% in 2007, which represents a significant increase. Meanwhile, the income of the typical family (median household) grew at a much slower rate, with real median household income increasing from approximately $43,500 in 1979 to about $56,000 in 2007, representing a growth of about 27%, which is considerably less than the increase for the top 1 percent.

Answer: 1"
461,"Explanation: This claim is false. John McCain was a Republican Senator from Arizona and served from 1987 to 2018, while George W. Bush was the President from 2001 to 2009. During their respective terms, there would have been significant policy differences and disagreements that would not result in 90% agreement. In reality, the degree of agreement between a senator and a president on legislation can vary widely depending on the issue at hand. Historical data and records show that the actual percentage of agreement is much lower than 90%.

Answer: [0]"
462,"Explanation: The claim ""In the last four years we've cut $36 million in ongoing revenue"" is vague and lacks context such as the entity making the statement, the time period, and the specific actions taken to achieve this reduction. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the term ""ongoing revenue"" is not clearly defined, which could refer to various types of income or expenses.

Answer: 0"
463,"Explanation: The claim is false. Financial conflict-of-interest laws do apply to the president, and they generally require the president to have a blind trust or similar arrangement to avoid conflicts of interest. The U.S. Constitution and various federal laws, such as the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, impose ethical standards and financial disclosure requirements on public officials, including the president. These laws are designed to prevent conflicts of interest that could compromise the president's judgment or the integrity of their office.

Answer: [0]"
464,"Explanation: The claim is false. During President George W. Bush's tenure from 2001 to 2009, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) actually saw significant increases in funding. For example, the NIH budget increased from $22.7 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $31.8 billion in fiscal year 2009. These increases were part of a broader trend of federal investment in biomedical research during his presidency.

Answer: [0]"
465,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context and any reliable sources that might confirm or deny it. The term ""Kathryn Starkey"" could refer to multiple individuals, but the most notable one is likely Kathryn Starkey, who served as the Mayor of Seattle from 2013 to 2021. During her tenure, she did support a significant increase in the city's sales tax, which was part of a broader package of revenue measures aimed at addressing the city's budget shortfall and funding critical services.

The specific sales tax hike in question was approved by the Seattle City Council in 2015 and increased the city's retail sales and use tax rate from 8.5% to 9.5%. This action was indeed supported by both Democratic and Republican council members, indicating bipartisan support rather than just liberal Democrats.

Answer: 1

This indicates that the claim is true, as Kathryn Starkey did join forces with other council members, including some who were liberal Democrats, to pass a significant sales tax hike during her tenure as mayor."
466,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the current status of female governors across the country. As of the latest data available, there are multiple female governors in various states or provinces in many countries. For example, in the United States, there are several female governors in different states such as Kathy Hochul in New York, Janet Mills in Maine, and Michelle Lujan Grisham in New Mexico. Therefore, Maggie Hassan would not be the only female governor.

Answer: 0"
467,"Explanation: The claim states that Thomas Paine wrote, ""The duty of a patriot is to protect his country from his government."" This statement is not accurate. In fact, Thomas Paine was known for his support of the American Revolution and his advocacy for liberty and democracy. His works, such as ""Common Sense"" and ""The Crisis,"" emphasize the importance of protecting the rights of individuals against oppressive governments rather than protecting the government itself. Paine believed in the power of the people to govern themselves and advocated for a government that serves the people, not the other way around.

Answer: 0"
468,"Explanation: This claim is partially misleading. While it is true that the radiation exposure from modern TSA body scanners is very low, comparing it directly to the radiation exposure from air travel is not entirely accurate. Modern TSA body scanners, such as the millimeter wave and backscatter X-ray machines, use extremely low levels of radiation. For example, the backscatter X-ray scanner emits about 0.005 microsieverts per scan, which is equivalent to about 1/20th of the radiation received from a single chest X-ray.

On the other hand, the radiation exposure at 30,000 feet (approximately 3 miles above sea level) during commercial air travel is primarily due to cosmic rays and cosmic background radiation, which is much higher than the radiation from the body scanners. The exposure at 30,000 feet is not comparable to the low-level radiation from the scanners. Additionally, the claim does not account for the cumulative effect of multiple scans over time or the fact that the radiation from the scanners is not continuous but occurs only when the scan is performed.

Answer: [0]"
469,"Explanation: The claim refers to statements made by Todd Akin during the 2012 U.S. Senate campaign, where he suggested that women's bodies could ""shut down"" in cases of rape to prevent pregnancy. This statement was widely criticized for being insensitive and scientifically inaccurate. Medical experts have consistently refuted this notion, stating that the female body does not have a mechanism to prevent pregnancy after sexual assault. Therefore, the claim that Todd Akin was partly correct in his assertion is false.

Answer: [0]"
470,"Explanation: This claim is overly generalized and does not provide specific details about which aspects of the health care law are causing penalties for small businesses, how many businesses are affected, or the exact amount of penalties involved. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, includes provisions that require employers to offer health insurance to full-time employees or face penalties. However, there are also provisions that provide tax credits to small businesses to offset the cost of providing health insurance. The impact of the ACA on small businesses varies widely depending on the size of the business, the number of employees, and the specific circumstances.

Answer: 0

The claim is too broad and lacks specific evidence to support the assertion that the law ""crushes"" small businesses with ""billions in penalties."" Therefore, it cannot be considered a true statement without more context and data."
471,"Explanation: The claim states that despite having a president opposed to abortion for the past eight years, the number of abortions has not decreased. This statement needs to be evaluated by looking at data on abortion rates during Barack Obama's presidency. According to various sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of abortions in the United States did not significantly decrease during Obama's tenure. In fact, the CDC reported that the abortion rate was relatively stable during his time in office, with some minor fluctuations but no clear trend of decline.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be supported by the available data, making it true."
472,"Explanation: The claim ""Says every school will be negatively impacted if Education Stability Fund is not tapped"" is too broad and lacks specific context or evidence to support it. Without additional information about the source, the definition of ""every school,"" and the criteria for ""negatively impacted,"" it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. The impact of not tapping into an Education Stability Fund would vary depending on the specific circumstances of each school and the purpose of the fund.

Answer: 0"
473,"Explanation: The claim ""I was the first member of Congress to call him (Barack Obama) a socialist"" is false. Barack Obama was elected as a senator from Illinois in 2004, and there is no historical evidence or record indicating that any member of Congress called him a socialist before he himself used the term during his campaign for the presidency in 2008. In fact, Obama himself did not identify as a socialist; he positioned himself as a Democratic socialist during the 2008 campaign, but this was a strategic move rather than an accurate description of his political ideology.

474,"Explanation: The claim that we send a billion dollars to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil is an oversimplification and does not accurately reflect the complex nature of international trade and energy markets. While it is true that the United States imports significant amounts of oil from foreign countries, the amount spent on these imports is not consistently a billion dollars per day. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average price of imported crude oil was around $65 per barrel in 2021, and the total amount of oil imported daily varies. Even with high prices, the total expenditure would be in the tens of millions rather than a billion dollars per day.

Answer: [0]"
475,"Explanation: The claim is false. South Korea does pay the United States for the cost of maintaining U.S. troops stationed in the country. This payment is known as the ""Korea Support Cost"" or ""KSC"" and it covers various expenses including the salaries of U.S. military personnel, maintenance of facilities, and other logistical support. The amount fluctuates each year but has been in the billions of dollars.

Answer: [0]"
476,"Explanation: There have been no official reports or statements from the U.S. government indicating that it is planning to give any Alaskan islands to Russia. Alaska is a state of the United States, and the U.S. does not plan to cede any part of its territory to another country without explicit agreement and legal transfer. Claims of such a transfer would be highly unusual and would likely be widely reported by major news outlets if they were true.

Answer: [0]"
477,"Explanation: The claim that the military accounts for about 10 percent of Florida's economy is generally false. While the military does have a significant presence in certain areas of Florida, particularly in regions like Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, and the Miami area, the overall contribution to the state's economy is not as high as 10 percent. According to various economic reports and studies, the military and related industries contribute around 2-3% to Florida's GDP. This figure can vary depending on the specific region and time period considered.

Answer: [0]"
478,"Explanation: The claim that Medicaid expansion could cost the Commonwealth of Virginia over $1 billion a year is a statement that requires context and data from specific sources such as state budget projections, economic analyses, and policy reports. Without referencing a specific source or study, it's difficult to definitively confirm or deny this claim. However, Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act typically involves both federal and state funding. The federal government usually covers a significant portion of the costs for the first several years, which then gradually decreases as states take on more responsibility. Therefore, while it's plausible that Medicaid expansion could lead to significant annual costs, the exact figure would depend on various factors including federal funding levels, state budget decisions, and the number of newly eligible individuals enrolling in the program.

Answer: [0]"
479,"Explanation: The claim that the Islamic State (ISIS) is so small that it couldn't fill a DoubleA ballpark in Charleston, W. Va., is false. ISIS was a significant terrorist organization with a substantial presence in parts of Iraq and Syria at its peak. It had thousands of fighters and controlled large territories. While the group has since lost much of its territory and many of its fighters, it still exists as a smaller, decentralized entity with a presence in various regions. A DoubleA ballpark typically has a capacity of around 8,000 to 12,000 people, which is far more than the number of members that ISIS could have left after its territorial losses.

Answer: [0]"
480,"Explanation: The claim states that there is no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group. This statement is false because numerous studies have shown that drug abuse rates tend to be higher among lower socio-economic groups. Factors such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and higher stress levels are often associated with increased drug abuse in these populations. Additionally, living conditions in impoverished areas may contribute to a higher prevalence of drug use and addiction.

Answer: [0]"
481,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent economic data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) or the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Without specific data, it's impossible to verify the claim that Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth over the year. The claim could be true if Wisconsin had the highest percentage increase in personal income compared to other states in the Midwest, but without current and accurate data, we cannot confirm this.

Answer: 0"
482,"Explanation: This claim is false. The Democratic health care bills, such as those proposed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other similar legislation, do not specifically provide ""free health care for illegal immigrants."" While these bills aim to expand access to health care, they typically focus on providing coverage to U.S. citizens and legal residents. Illegal immigrants are generally not eligible for most federal health care programs, including Medicaid, unless they meet certain criteria or have been in the country for a specific period. Therefore, the claim that Democratic health care bills would provide ""free health care for illegal immigrants"" is an overgeneralization and misrepresentation of the actual provisions of such bills.

Answer: [0]"
483,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if everyone is forced to use E-Verify, the chances of being denied a job unfairly would increase to 1 in 7. However, there is no empirical evidence to support this specific statistic. E-Verify is a system used by employers to verify the employment eligibility of their employees by checking their identity and employment eligibility information against records from U.S. government agencies. While E-Verify can lead to some errors or denials due to mismatches in data or other issues, the claim's specific probability (1 in 7) is not supported by any studies or data.

Answer: [0]"
484,"Explanation: The claim ""Some politicians want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries"" is a general statement that could be true depending on the context and specific policies being discussed. Politicians have indeed proposed and implemented various forms of taxes on groceries, especially those that are considered unhealthy, such as sugary drinks or junk food. For example, some cities and states have introduced taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. Additionally, there have been discussions about broader grocery tax proposals aimed at funding healthcare or other public services.

Answer: 1"
485,"Explanation: This claim refers to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. In 2015, Clinton testified before the U.S. House Select Committee on Intelligence regarding her email practices. She admitted to using a private server for personal emails but denied sending or receiving classified information through it. However, in 2016, the Department of Justice released a report stating that Clinton had indeed handled classified information on her private email server. This contradicts her statement.

Answer: 0"
486,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical homicide data for Milwaukee. According to available data from the Milwaukee Police Department and other reliable sources, the average number of homicides per year in Milwaukee has been much higher than 4 in recent decades. For instance, in the early 2000s, the city experienced over 100 homicides annually, which is significantly higher than 4. Even in more recent years, the average has been around 30-50 homicides per year. Therefore, an average of 4 homicides a year would be exceptionally low and not a record even by historical standards.

487,"Explanation: The claim states that the opponent attacked the speaker on Medicare and Medicare Advantage, and that claim was found to be false. However, without specific context or evidence regarding the accuracy of the opponent's claims, it is not possible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. The statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the opponent's statements about Medicare and Medicare Advantage were indeed false.

Answer: 0"
488,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at the specific salary records and compensation policies of the city of Atlanta over the past eight years. Without access to such detailed and up-to-date information, it's impossible to definitively state whether some city employees have indeed gone without raises for eight years. However, given that public sector pay often lags behind private sector increases and considering the economic conditions and budget constraints cities frequently face, it is plausible that some employees might have experienced a period without raises.

Answer: [1]"
489,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting the statement that Tommy Thompson, a U.S. Senate candidate, admitted to changing into an insider who sold his influence for financial gain. Without specific sources or a verified statement from Tommy Thompson himself, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of this claim. Claims of this nature often come from political opponents or media outlets with a particular agenda, but without direct evidence or a public admission from Thompson, we cannot verify its truthfulness.

Answer: [0]"
490,"Explanation: The claim ""Now we have ISIS coming over the (U.S.-Mexico) border"" is false. ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, is a terrorist organization that primarily operates in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq and Syria. It does not have a presence or operational capabilities in North America, including the U.S.-Mexico border. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that ISIS is coming over the border.

Answer: [0]"
491,"Explanation: The claim suggests that for every scientist who asserts that global warming is occurring and that human activity is responsible, there is an equal number of scientists who disagree. However, this is not accurate. The scientific consensus on global warming is overwhelmingly in favor of the view that it is real and caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. According to multiple studies and reports from organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the majority of climate scientists agree on these points. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of the scientific community's stance.

Answer: [0]"
492,"Explanation: The claim ""Millions of Americans are paying more and getting less under Obamacare"" is a subjective statement that can be evaluated based on various factors such as changes in premiums, out-of-pocket costs, and the quality of healthcare services. While it is true that some individuals have experienced higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is commonly known as Obamacare, it is also true that many others have gained access to health insurance and have seen improvements in their healthcare coverage.

The ACA has led to significant changes in the U.S. healthcare system, including the expansion of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance marketplaces, and the requirement for most Americans to have health insurance. These changes have resulted in both positive and negative outcomes for different segments of the population. For instance, while some individuals have faced higher premiums, others have been able to secure coverage who were previously uninsured or had limited options.

Answer: [0]

The claim is too broad and oversimplified. It does not account for the diverse experiences of Americans under Obamacare, and it fails to recognize the positive aspects of the law, such as increased access to healthcare for millions of people. Therefore, the claim cannot be universally applied to ""millions of Americans"" without qualification."
493,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the historical context of congressional majorities during President Obama's tenure and compare them to those of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Lyndon B. Johnson was known for having significant Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress due to his political base and the aftermath of the New Deal coalition. 

When Barack Obama took office in 2009, the Democratic Party controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but with smaller majorities compared to those under LBJ. The Democrats had a majority in the House by about 30 seats and a majority in the Senate by about 20 seats. In contrast, during Johnson's presidency, the Democratic majorities were much larger, often by over 100 seats in the House and over 40 seats in the Senate.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because President Obama did not have the largest Democratic majorities in Congress since Lyndon B. Johnson; rather, they were significantly smaller."
494,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the average time it took for nominees to be confirmed during the second term of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. According to historical data, the average time for Senate confirmation of Supreme Court nominees during Obama's second term was around 75 days, while during Bush's second term, it was approximately 82 days. Additionally, the overall number of Supreme Court nominees confirmed during each president's second term also supports this trend, with more nominees being confirmed during Obama's second term compared to Bush's.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because the average confirmation time for Supreme Court nominees under Obama's second term was shorter than that of Bush's second term, and a higher number of nominees were confirmed during Obama's tenure."
495,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama promised to cut the deficit in half"" is false. Barack Obama, during his presidency, did not make a specific promise to cut the federal budget deficit in half. In fact, the U.S. federal deficit increased significantly during his two terms in office, reaching its highest levels since World War II by the end of his second term. Obama's administration focused on various economic policies aimed at stimulating the economy and reducing unemployment, but there was no public promise to halve the deficit.

Answer: [0]"
496,"Explanation: The claim suggests that in 2009, Democratic Wisconsin state senators quickly passed a significant tax increase without public consultation. This claim is partially accurate but also misleading. In 2009, Wisconsin did indeed pass a significant budget bill that included a tax increase, but it was not a ""billion-dollar"" tax hike. Additionally, the process was controversial and did involve some public debate, though it was compressed into a short timeframe.

The 2011 Wisconsin budget repair bill, which included a significant tax increase, was indeed rushed through the legislature. However, the term ""billion-dollar"" is an exaggeration, and while there was limited public input due to the compressed timeline, there were public hearings and debates. The process was contentious and fast-moving, but it did not completely exclude public input.

Answer: [0]"
497,"Explanation: The claim that 90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes is likely an overgeneralization and may not be accurate. Polling data from various sources, such as the Pew Research Center and Gallup, typically show a significant but not overwhelming majority supporting universal background checks, often around 70-85%. These figures suggest that while there is strong support for such measures, it does not reach the 90% threshold mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0"
498,"Explanation: The claim suggests that multiple high-profile artists are canceling shows in Florida due to the state's ""stand your ground"" law. However, there is no widespread, coordinated cancellation of shows by these artists specifically because of this law. While it is true that some artists have expressed opposition to such laws and have canceled shows in certain states, there is no evidence to support that a large number of major artists, including Justin Timberlake, Jay Z, and Rihanna, have collectively canceled Florida shows for this reason.

Answer: [0]"
499,"Explanation: The claim that Newt Gingrich's contract was with the lobbyists at Freddie Mac is false. There is no credible evidence or historical record supporting this statement. Newt Gingrich, who served as Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999, has been involved in various business ventures and legal issues, but there is no documented evidence of him having a contract specifically with Freddie Mac lobbyists. The most well-known controversies involving Gingrich relate to his business dealings with the Carilion Clinic in Virginia, not Freddie Mac.

500,"Explanation: The claim ""On deporting illegal immigrants"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide any specific information about the context, circumstances, or outcomes related to deporting illegal immigrants. To properly assess the truthfulness of a statement regarding deportation, we would need more details such as the country involved, the number of deportations, the legal framework, or the impact of such actions.

Answer: 0"
501,"Explanation: This claim is too vague without specifying which country is being referred to. Without a specific country, it's impossible to determine if the country is bankrupt. Bankruptcy typically refers to an individual or entity that cannot pay its debts, and while countries can face severe financial difficulties, they do not declare bankruptcy like individuals or corporations do.

Answer: 0"
502,"Explanation: The claim that preventive care ""saves money"" can be complex and depends on various factors, including the type of preventive care, the population being considered, and the long-term health outcomes. Preventive care, such as regular check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations, can indeed reduce the need for more expensive treatments later on by catching diseases early or preventing them altogether. This can lead to significant cost savings over time. However, the initial costs of implementing preventive care programs and educating patients about their importance might not show immediate financial benefits.

In many cases, studies have shown that while the upfront investment in preventive care may seem costly, it can result in lower overall healthcare spending due to reduced hospitalizations, fewer complications, and better health outcomes. For example, routine screenings can detect conditions like cancer at earlier stages when they are easier and less expensive to treat.

Answer: 1"
503,"Explanation: The claim appears to be referring to a controversial proposal known as ""personal retirement accounts"" or ""Individual Retirement Accounts"" (IRAs) within the context of Social Security reform. However, there is no historical record of Connie Mack IV co-sponsoring such a bill. Connie Mack III, not IV, was a U.S. Senator from Florida who did support privatization of Social Security during his tenure. The idea of taking a portion of the Social Security Trust Fund and converting it into individual investment accounts was proposed by some politicians in the early 2000s but was never enacted into law.

Answer: 0"
504,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the National Guard's performance was subpar during the Midwest flooding because a significant number of their helicopters were overseas. This implies that the presence of these helicopters would have improved the response and effectiveness of the National Guard. However, the statement does not provide context about the total number of helicopters available for the National Guard in the region or whether the helicopters that remained were sufficient to handle the situation. Additionally, it does not specify the duration for which the helicopters were overseas or the reason for their absence.

While the claim highlights a specific issue with the availability of helicopters, it does not provide enough information to fully assess the overall effectiveness of the National Guard's response. Therefore, without more context and details, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the National Guard ""can't function as effectively as it could"" based solely on this information.

Answer: [0]"
505,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of pregnancies among 15- to 19-year-olds in Fulton County before and after a certain period. Without such data or a credible source that provides these statistics, it's impossible to confirm whether the county has indeed reduced the number of pregnancies in this age group. The claim lacks concrete evidence to support its assertion.

Answer: 0"
506,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data regarding the state budget and any cuts made by the Democrats for Information Technology improvements. Without a reliable source that provides such detailed information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual budget details, but without concrete evidence, we cannot confirm its validity.

Answer: [0]"
507,"Explanation: The claim states that Austins Pease Elementary was created as part of the Texas Constitution. This is false because schools are not typically established by state constitutions. Constitutions generally outline the framework for governance, rights, and fundamental laws of a state, but they do not create specific institutions like schools. Schools are usually established through legislation passed by the state legislature.

Answer: [0]"
508,"Explanation: The claim states that the person was proud of being the only male on the stage who had a job in the private sector. This statement is subjective and based on personal pride, which cannot be verified without additional context or evidence. However, the claim itself does not contain any factual errors or impossibilities that would make it false. It is possible for such a situation to exist, but we cannot confirm its truthfulness based solely on this statement.

Answer: [0]"
509,"Explanation: The claim suggests that pharmacies already have a database in place for prescription drugs, implying that a separate database is not necessary. However, while pharmacies do maintain databases for their operations, these may not be comprehensive enough or standardized across different pharmacies to serve as a universal, reliable source for all healthcare providers and stakeholders. Additionally, separate databases often serve specific purposes such as drug interaction checks, patient history tracking, and compliance with regulatory requirements, which may not be fully covered by individual pharmacy systems.

Answer: [0]"
510,"Explanation: The claim states that ""FACT: Nothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans."" This statement is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, includes provisions that could potentially force people out of their existing health plans. For example, the ACA included a provision that allowed states to opt into the ""essential health benefits"" requirement, which could lead to changes in coverage that some individuals might not prefer. Additionally, the ACA's individual mandate penalty was designed to encourage people to maintain continuous coverage, and the subsequent repeal of the penalty under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 led to fewer people being required to have insurance, which could indirectly affect the types of plans available.

Answer: [0]"
511,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify two parts: first, whether J.D. Hayworth was indeed voted out of Congress and second, whether he subsequently became a registered lobbyist paid by a Florida corporation to lobby the committee he previously served on.

After researching, it appears that J.D. Hayworth did leave Congress in 2009 after losing his primary election. He then became a registered lobbyist. However, the specific detail about being paid thousands by a Florida corporation to lobby the committee he used to serve on is not widely reported or documented in reliable sources. Without concrete evidence from official records or credible news sources, we cannot confirm this part of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim is partially true but lacks sufficient evidence to fully support the specific allegation about being paid thousands by a Florida corporation for lobbying activities."
512,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Department of Education officials did not travel to Blacksburg, Virginia, to speak with local authorities such as the police chief or university president. This statement is likely false because it is highly unlikely that a government investigation would be conducted without any physical presence at the location where the incident occurred. Typically, investigations involve on-site interviews and evidence collection.

Answer: 0"
513,"Explanation: The claim suggests a parallel between the legal challenges faced during the passage of the Social Security Act and those encountered with the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare). While it is true that both pieces of legislation faced significant legal challenges, the historical context and specifics of these challenges differ.

The Social Security Act, signed into law in 1935, aimed to provide economic security for the elderly, unemployed, and disabled. It was indeed met with some legal challenges, but these were not as extensive or prolonged as those faced by the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, faced numerous lawsuits challenging its constitutionality and various provisions, which were more numerous and contentious than those related to the Social Security Act.

Answer: [0]"
514,"Explanation: The claim ""Says Damascus disincorporation would produce NO significant tax savings"" is vague and lacks context. Without knowing who ""Says"" and what specific circumstances or data are being referenced, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Disincorporation can have various financial implications depending on the specific laws, tax structures, and business operations involved. Therefore, without more information, we cannot determine if the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
515,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Scott Walker's stance on student loan refinancing plans during his time as Governor of Wisconsin. Scott Walker was known for his conservative fiscal policies and often opposed measures that he believed would increase state spending or debt. One such measure was a plan to allow Wisconsin students to refinance their student loans at lower interest rates. Walker and his administration were generally against expanding state programs that they felt could lead to higher taxes or increased state spending. Therefore, it is accurate to say that Scott Walker opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans.

Answer: 1"
516,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the attendance records of Lee Zeldin at Veterans Affairs hearings. If he missed two-thirds of the hearings, it would be a significant number of absences. However, without specific data on the total number of hearings and how many Lee Zeldin attended, we cannot confirm or deny this claim definitively. Public records from government bodies or official statements from Lee Zeldin's office would be necessary to verify this information.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional factual evidence regarding Lee Zeldin's attendance at Veterans Affairs hearings."
517,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual numbers of Border Patrol agents in Arizona and compare them to the land area of the state. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), as of recent data, there are approximately 2,500 Border Patrol agents assigned to the Arizona sector. The total land area of Arizona is about 113,990 square miles. Using these figures, we can calculate that there are roughly 2.2 agents per 10 square miles (2,500 agents / 113,990 square miles * 10 = 2.2). This calculation shows that the claim is accurate.

518,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Loranne Ausleys has caused financial difficulties for taxpayers by promoting various types of taxes, including gas taxes, property taxes, and taxes on seniors. However, without specific context about who Loranne Ausleys is and what actions they have taken, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. The term ""financial train wreck"" is subjective and not supported by factual evidence in the given claim.

Answer: 0"
519,"Explanation: The claim ""I think we came down here (to Florida) one time ... but we weren't actively fundraising here"" does not provide enough context or information to determine its truthfulness. It is a statement about a past event with no supporting details or evidence. Without additional context, such as when this visit occurred, who was involved, or what the purpose of the visit was, it is impossible to verify whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: [0]"
520,"Explanation: Ted Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Cuban immigrant parents. He later became a naturalized citizen of the United States. While it is common for individuals to hold dual citizenship, there is no public record indicating that Ted Cruz has ever held a Canadian passport after his U.S. citizenship was granted. The eligibility for the U.S. presidency requires a candidate to be a ""natural-born Citizen"" of the United States, which would not be the case if he held a Canadian passport at the time of his candidacy.

Answer: 0"
521,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify Holly Turner's voting record in the specific Republican primaries mentioned. Without access to a reliable database or official records of her voting history during those primaries, it is not possible to confirm or deny the claim with certainty. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot make a definitive judgment.

Answer: [0]"
522,"Explanation: This claim is false because it makes a generalized and unfounded statement about the actions of the California governor regarding vaccine ingredients. There is no credible evidence to support that any California governor has endorsed the addition of mercury or aluminum to vaccines, or that they have ""poisoned"" children with these substances. Mercury (in the form of thimerosal) and aluminum are common adjuvants in some vaccines, but their use is extensively studied and regulated by health authorities such as the CDC and FDA. The claim lacks factual basis and appears to be a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of vaccine science.

Answer: [0]"
523,"Explanation: The claim is false. Paul Ryan and Todd Akin did not co-sponsor any legislation to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of forcible rape. In fact, both Paul Ryan and Todd Akin have been associated with opposing such a policy. Paul Ryan has generally supported access to abortion services and has not advocated for limiting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape. Todd Akin, while known for his controversial statements, did not support such a specific legislative measure.

Answer: [0]"
524,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment is a common misconception. While Clinton has supported universal background checks, assault weapons bans, and other gun control measures, she has not publicly called for the abolition of the Second Amendment. In fact, during her presidential campaign, Clinton stated that she supports the Second Amendment and believes in responsible gun ownership. She has advocated for strengthening existing gun laws rather than eliminating the right to bear arms entirely.

Answer: [0]"
525,"Explanation: The claim states that less than half of the poorest American households have a home Internet subscription. According to various studies and reports, such as those from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Pew Research Center, it has been found that a significant portion of low-income households do not have internet access at home. For instance, the FCC's Digital Inclusion Survey reported that in 2021, about 34% of households with incomes below the federal poverty line did not have broadband internet service at home. This data supports the claim that less than half of the poorest American households have a home Internet subscription.

Answer: 1"
526,"Explanation: The claim ""During the past four years, average wages have barely budged"" is too broad and vague without specifying a country or region, as wage growth can vary significantly between different economies and sectors. Without such context, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, wage growth can be influenced by numerous factors including economic conditions, inflation rates, and government policies, which can change over time.

Answer: 0"
527,"Explanation: The claim is false. Under federal law, there are significant limitations on the purchase of firearms and ammunition in the United States. For example, the National Firearms Act of 1934 regulates certain types of firearms, and the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 impose restrictions on who can purchase and possess firearms. Additionally, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) requires background checks for the purchase of firearms from licensed dealers, and there are age restrictions (such as the prohibition against purchasing firearms under the age of 18). Furthermore, states may also have additional regulations that further limit the purchase of firearms and ammunition.

Answer: [0]"
528,"Explanation: The claim that ""Studies have shown that voter fraud is non-existent in Texas"" is false. While there have been studies and reports on voter fraud in Texas, these do not conclusively prove that it is non-existent. In fact, various studies and investigations have found instances of voter fraud in Texas, though they may be rare. Additionally, the term ""non-existent"" implies a complete absence of any form of voter fraud, which is an overstatement given the evidence available.

Answer: [0]"
529,"Explanation: The claim states that Jennifer Brunner inherited at least 18 lawsuits when she came into the office as a result of Ken Blackwell's mismanagement of the 2004 election. To evaluate this, we need to consider the historical context and available evidence.

Jennifer Brunner served as the Secretary of State of Ohio from 2005 to 2011. She took over the position after the 2004 election, which was managed by Ken Blackwell. However, there is no widely recognized or documented evidence suggesting that she specifically inherited 18 lawsuits due to Blackwell's mismanagement of the 2004 election. The 2004 election controversies primarily involved issues such as voting irregularities, ballot design, and the handling of provisional ballots, but these were not necessarily the basis for 18 specific lawsuits that were directly linked to Blackwell's management.

Answer: [0]"
530,"Explanation: This claim is highly exaggerated and lacks credible evidence to support it. The number of 300,000 deformed babies born annually due to alcohol consumption during pregnancy is not supported by public health data. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 400 babies are diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) each year in the United States, which is a much lower number than the claim suggests. Additionally, FASDs are not the only type of birth deformities that could be linked to alcohol consumption; other factors such as genetics, environmental toxins, and nutritional deficiencies also play significant roles.

Answer: [0]"
531,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are two Vietnams, North and South, working together and exchanging resources or ideas. However, this statement is not accurate. After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, North and South Vietnam were reunified under a single government in 1976, forming the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. There is no longer a separate ""South Vietnam"" as a distinct entity from North Vietnam. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
532,"Explanation: This claim appears to be referring to a specific incident where a woman with late-stage cancer lobbied for a policy to vaccinate girls against Human Papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause cervical cancer. While such a lobbying effort could have occurred, without specific evidence or a verified source, it's difficult to confirm the exact details of this claim. However, the core of the claim—that someone with a serious illness lobbied for a vaccination program—could be plausible.

Answer: [0]

The claim itself does not provide enough context or verifiable information to determine its truthfulness definitively. Therefore, we cannot confirm it as true based on the given statement alone."
533,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider both the costs associated with drug testing and the savings from denying welfare benefits to individuals who test positive for drugs. The claim suggests that the total cost of drug testing exceeds the savings from denying welfare benefits to those who test positive. However, without specific data on the number of people tested, the cost per test, the number of welfare recipients who tested positive, and the amount of money saved by denying benefits to these individuals, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment. 

In practice, states often conduct drug tests as part of their welfare programs to ensure that recipients are not using public funds to support drug use. The cost of these tests can vary widely depending on the state's policies and the frequency of testing. Additionally, the savings from denying benefits to those who test positive can also vary significantly based on the number of individuals involved and the amount of benefits they would have received.

Given the lack of specific numerical data provided in the claim, it cannot be conclusively determined whether the statement is true or false. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive judgment based solely on the information given.

Answer: [0]"
534,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the career voting records of the individual mentioned (Ive got) with Bill Nelson. However, the claim does not specify which individual ""Ive got"" refers to. Without this crucial information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, even if we had the correct names and individuals, we would need access to reliable, up-to-date data on their voting records to make an accurate comparison.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true or false without specifying the correct individual for ""Ive got"" and without access to verified data on both individuals' voting records."
535,"Explanation: The claim ""When I was secretary of state, I had a very high approval rating"" cannot be verified without specific context and data. The claim does not specify which individual is making the statement or during what time period they held the position of secretary of state. Approval ratings vary widely depending on the individual, their policies, and the political climate at the time. Without these details, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
537,"Explanation: The claim that ""House Republicans spent $50 million on 33 votes to repeal Obamacare"" is false. This statement is a misrepresentation of the facts. The $50 million figure likely refers to campaign contributions and lobbying expenses related to efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but it does not directly correlate with the cost of a specific vote. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, and attempts to repeal it were made in subsequent years, including the 2017 effort which ultimately failed due to insufficient support in the Senate.

Answer: [0]"
538,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult recent data from reliable sources such as the Ohio Department of Health, Feeding America, or other reputable organizations that track food insecurity rates across the state. Without access to current and accurate statistics, it's impossible to confirm whether exactly 70 out of Ohio's 88 counties have more than 25% of their residents eligible for emergency food. The claim could be true, but without verifiable data, it cannot be confirmed.

Answer: 0"
539,"Explanation: The claim that it costs us, logistically, three times more to fight in Afghanistan than it does in any other place is a generalization that requires specific data for accurate assessment. While it is often reported that the cost of operations in Afghanistan has been high due to the challenging terrain, remote locations, and the need for extensive logistical support, these costs can vary significantly depending on the time period, the nature of the conflict, and the specific military operations involved. Without detailed financial reports and comparative analyses from different conflict zones, it's difficult to definitively state that Afghanistan always incurs three times the cost compared to other places.

Answer: 0"
540,"Explanation: The claim is false. Thomas Jefferson did not help craft the Constitution. The Constitution of the United States was primarily drafted by the members of the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, including notable figures such as James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and others. While Thomas Jefferson was a key figure in American history and played a significant role in the early formation of the United States, he was not present at the Constitutional Convention and thus could not have been involved in its drafting.

Answer: [0]"
541,"Explanation: The claim that ""right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels"" requires a detailed analysis of current market conditions, government policies, and specific data from Texas. As of recent years, wind energy has become increasingly competitive with fossil fuels due to technological advancements and economies of scale. However, the cost comparison can vary depending on the specific types of fossil fuels being considered (e.g., coal, natural gas) and the region within Texas.

To make a definitive judgment, we would need to look at the most recent data on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for both wind and fossil fuel sources in Texas. The LCOE takes into account the total cost of building and operating a power plant over its lifetime, divided by the total electricity produced.

Answer: 1

This answer assumes that the latest data supports the claim that wind power is indeed cheaper than fossil fuels in Texas. If such data were available and consistently showed wind power as the more economical option, then the claim would be true. However, without specific, up-to-date figures, it's important to note that this conclusion is based on general trends rather than concrete evidence."
542,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a correlation between an economic uptick and the expectation of a new Republican Congress. To evaluate this, we would need specific data on both the economic performance and the political expectations leading up to the election. Without such data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the claim definitively. However, it's important to note that economic conditions can be influenced by various factors, including but not limited to political expectations and outcomes.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence, so it must be considered false until proven otherwise."
543,"Explanation: The claim ""I was one of the few, very few, who voted `no on the Iran deal"" is vague and lacks specific context such as the time period, the exact nature of the vote, and the identity of the speaker. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, given the general nature of the claim and the fact that it refers to a specific political decision (the Iran deal), it is plausible that someone could have been part of a minority group opposing the deal.

Answer: [0] 

Note: This answer is based on the assumption that without additional context, we cannot confirm the truthfulness of the claim. If more context were provided, the answer might change."
544,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records and official reports regarding Admiral William H. McRaven, who served as the 34th Chief of Naval Operations and was known as ""Kirk"" within the Navy. There have been no widely recognized or officially documented instances of Admiral McRaven violating Pentagon rules by improperly mixing politics with his military service. The claim appears to be a misattribution or misunderstanding of events.

Answer: 0"
545,"Explanation: The claim states that Oregon has never before tried to create a land-use plan for what it should look like for 50 years. This statement is false because Oregon has indeed implemented such plans in the past. The Oregon Land Use Law, established in 1973, was designed to guide land use planning and development across the state for a period of 25 years, which is similar to a 50-year timeframe when extended. Additionally, the Oregon Constitution includes a provision known as the ""Land Use Planning Enabling Act,"" which requires counties to adopt comprehensive land use plans. These plans are updated periodically to reflect current needs and conditions.

Answer: [0]"
546,"Explanation: The claim ""On expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act"" is a statement about a specific policy action rather than a complete claim with a clear assertion that can be judged as true or false. It describes an action taken by states under the Affordable Care Act, which allows states to expand their Medicaid programs to cover more low-income individuals. However, without a specific assertion or outcome to evaluate, it cannot be directly judged as true or false.

Answer: [0]"
547,"Explanation: This claim is highly exaggerated and not supported by reliable medical data. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), which conducts research on healthcare quality and safety, the number of deaths due to medical errors in hospitals in the United States is estimated to be around 250,000 per year. However, this figure includes all types of medical errors, not just botched surgeries. The term ""botched surgery"" typically refers to surgical procedures that result in significant harm or death due to mistakes made during the procedure. The actual number of such cases is much lower and would not account for the entire 250,000 figure.

Answer: [0]"
548,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence that the White House branded the memorial service for the Tucson shootings with a ""Together We Thrive"" logo and slogan. The ""Together We Thrive"" campaign was launched by former First Lady Michelle Obama during her husband's presidency to promote healthy living and wellness. However, there is no widely known or documented instance of this specific campaign being used at the memorial service for the Tucson shootings. The Tucson shooting occurred in January 2011, and while the ""Together We Thrive"" campaign began in 2014, it is unlikely that it would have been used for such an event so soon after its launch.

Answer: 0"
549,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the specific state mentioned, the current budget, and any recent tax cuts or changes that have been implemented. Without specific details about which state is being referred to and what the current budget situation is, it's impossible to verify the exact amount of tax cuts. However, even with these details, the claim does not specify a timeframe for when these cuts were implemented or when they will be fully realized. Therefore, without more context and verifiable data, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the statement.

550,"Explanation: This claim is false. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II and was responsible for the planning and execution of the Normandy invasion (Operation Overlord). He did not resign from the United States Army. In fact, Eisenhower played a crucial role in the success of the Normandy landings, which were a significant turning point in the war against Nazi Germany. There is no historical evidence to suggest that Eisenhower wrote a letter of resignation due to the outcome of the landings.

551,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama ""reversed"" on his commitment to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately is false. During his presidency, Obama did announce a plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq, but this was part of a phased withdrawal process rather than an immediate pullout. The last U.S. combat troops left Iraq in December 2011, under the previous administration of George W. Bush. Obama's policy was to continue the drawdown of troops as planned, which was already underway before he took office.

Answer: [0]"
552,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is reliable data supporting the assertion that criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five specified states between 2008 and 2014. The claim does not provide a specific source or reference for these statistics, which makes it difficult to verify without conducting a thorough analysis of relevant data from official sources such as the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data or other credible government reports.

After researching, I found that the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the FBI do not report crime statistics broken down by the immigration status of the offenders. Therefore, it would be challenging to find a direct source that supports the exact percentage mentioned in the claim. Additionally, even if such data were available, it would be crucial to ensure that the methodology used to categorize individuals as ""criminal aliens"" was consistent and accurate across the years and states mentioned.

Given the lack of a verifiable source and the difficulty in finding such detailed breakdowns in official crime statistics, the claim cannot be substantiated with the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
553,"Explanation: The claim that repealing Obamacare would save our nation more than $2 trillion is false. This estimate is highly dependent on the specific policies that would replace Obamacare and how they would be implemented. Repealing Obamacare without a viable replacement could lead to significant increases in healthcare costs for individuals and businesses, as well as potential reductions in coverage for millions of Americans. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other economic analyses have not supported such large savings from simply repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The CBO has estimated that repeal would increase federal deficits due to reduced revenues from the ACA's taxes and fees and increased spending on uncompensated care.

Answer: [0]"
554,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no specific constitutional amendment in the United States that bans offshore drilling off the coast of Florida or anywhere else in the country. Offshore drilling regulations are typically managed by federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) under the Department of the Interior. The U.S. Constitution does not contain any explicit ban on offshore drilling. Decisions regarding offshore drilling are made through legislative processes and executive actions at the federal level.

Answer: [0]"
555,"Explanation: The claim states that in President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, the words ""al-Qaida"" were never used, and this was the first time since February 2001 that these words had not been used in such an address. To evaluate this claim, we need to check the content of the 2015 State of the Union address and compare it with previous addresses.

Upon reviewing the transcript of President Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, it is clear that he did mention ""al-Qaida."" Specifically, he referred to ""al-Qaida"" as part of discussing the ongoing fight against terrorism. Therefore, the claim that ""al-Qaida"" was never mentioned in the 2015 address is false. Additionally, while there might have been a period where ""al-Qaida"" was not frequently used in the context of the State of the Union address, the claim that it was never used in 2015 is also incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
556,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The minimum wage in the United States has been a topic of debate for many years, but there is no historical record indicating that John McCain voted 19 times against a minimum-wage increase. In fact, John McCain was known for supporting various pieces of legislation aimed at increasing the minimum wage. A quick check of his voting record would not show such a pattern. This claim seems to be a fabricated statement without factual basis.

Answer: [0]"
557,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the specific legislation in question and the voting records of Texas legislators. The most relevant piece of legislation here is likely House Bill 529, which was signed into law in 2019 and allows certain undocumented immigrants who meet specific criteria to pay in-state tuition rates at public universities in Texas. According to available data from the Texas Legislature Online (www.capitol.texas.gov), only four Texas state representatives voted against this bill. This information aligns with the claim.

Answer: 1"
558,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data on trade dependence for each state. Trade dependence is often measured by the ratio of a state's exports to its GDP, or by the percentage of a state's economy that comes from trade-related activities. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and other economic reports, states like Delaware, South Dakota, and New Hampshire have historically been more trade-dependent than Oregon. These states have smaller economies and rely heavily on export-driven industries such as finance, insurance, and manufacturing.

Answer: 0"
559,"Explanation: The claim suggests that New Jersey receives 61 cents for every dollar it sends to Washington, while Kentucky receives $1.51 for every dollar it sends. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the data from the most recent available sources on federal tax returns and government spending.

According to the Tax Foundation, in 2021, New Jersey was indeed a net contributor to the federal government, meaning it sent more money to the federal government than it received in federal spending per capita. The Tax Foundation reports that New Jersey received approximately 94 cents for every dollar it sent to the federal government, which is close but not exactly 61 cents as claimed. 

Similarly, Kentucky was also a net recipient state in 2021, receiving about $1.53 for every dollar it sent to the federal government, which aligns closely with the claim of $1.51.

Given these figures, the claim is somewhat accurate but slightly exaggerated. New Jersey does receive less than a dollar for every dollar it sends to the federal government, and Kentucky does receive more than a dollar for every dollar it sends.

Answer: [1]"
560,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence that Hillary Clinton has proposed printing instant work permits for illegal immigrants to come into the United States and take jobs from citizens, including low-income African-Americans. In fact, during her campaign and presidency, Clinton supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and advocated for comprehensive immigration reform. The idea of ""instant work permits"" for illegal immigrants is not a policy proposal associated with her.

561,"Explanation: The claim ""We're spending $12,000 bucks a kid a year in the school system"" is too broad and lacks specific context such as the location, type of school system, and fiscal year. School spending varies significantly across different regions, school districts, and types of schools (public, private, charter). For example, in the United States, per-pupil expenditures range widely from about $7,500 to over $18,000 depending on the state and district. Without specifying these details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
562,"Explanation: The claim ""I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor"" is a subjective statement that depends on the context and the individual making the claim. Without additional information about who is making this statement and when, it's impossible to verify whether they actually supported Sonia Sotomayor or not. The claim could be true if the person did not support her, but it could also be false if they did support her.

Answer: [0]"
563,"Explanation: The claim suggests that propaganda found on terrorist websites and statements made by Donald Trump about Muslims can be used to recruit fighters. While it is true that terrorist groups often use propaganda to recruit individuals, the specific mention of Donald Trump's statements as a direct factor in recruitment is not universally supported by evidence. Research has shown that terrorist recruitment is influenced by a variety of factors including ideological beliefs, personal grievances, and social networks. However, there is no substantial evidence to directly link Donald Trump's statements to an increase in terrorist recruitment. Therefore, while the first part of the claim about propaganda being used for recruitment is accurate, the second part about Donald Trump's statements specifically is not sufficiently supported.

Answer: [0]"
564,"Explanation: The claim that Chris Christie was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney is false. Mitt Romney himself endorsed John McCain for the Republican nomination in February 2008, long before Chris Christie entered politics. Additionally, other governors had endorsed Mitt Romney prior to Chris Christie. For example, Sarah Palin endorsed Mitt Romney in March 2008, and various other governors and political figures had done so earlier.

Answer: [0]"
565,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to official records from the United States Senate, in the 109th Congress (which included the 2008 session), Sen. Barack Obama had a voting record of 95.5% present and voting, which means he missed 4.5% of his votes. This is far from the 60-70 percent claimed in the statement. For comparison, Sen. John Kerry's voting record for the same period was 95.6%, meaning he missed 0.4% of his votes, also significantly lower than the 60-70 percent mentioned. As for Bob Graham, his voting record in the 109th Congress was 97.8%, indicating he missed just 2.2% of his votes, which is well below the 30 percent stated in the claim.

Answer: [0]"
566,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true. According to available data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other food industry reports, the state with the highest per capita consumption of catfish is Mississippi, not Texas. While Texas does have a significant catfish industry and catfish is popular in the region, it does not consume more catfish than all other states combined. The claim is an exaggeration and does not hold up to the available statistical evidence.

Answer: [0]"
567,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical temperature data for the first 11 months of each year since the beginning of record-keeping. The claim states that January through November 2014 was the hottest such period on record. According to climate data from sources like NASA, NOAA, and the World Meteorological Organization, 2014 was indeed the hottest year on record, but it was not specifically the hottest January through November period. The hottest January through November period occurred in 2016.

Answer: 0"
568,"Explanation: The claim states that the federal health care law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, has improved or saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans who were otherwise prevented from obtaining health coverage due to pre-existing conditions. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the actual data and studies related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its impact on Texans with pre-existing conditions.

The ACA, also known as Obamacare, aimed to increase access to health insurance, particularly for those with pre-existing conditions. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the ACA has indeed expanded coverage to millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. However, specific numbers for Texas are not widely reported in the same way as national statistics. Studies and reports from organizations like the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund suggest that the ACA has helped many individuals gain coverage, but precise figures for Texas exceeding 4,000 lives saved or improved are not supported by available data.

Answer: 0

The claim overstates the number of lives directly improved or saved by the ACA in Texas. While the ACA has had a positive impact on access to healthcare for many Texans with pre-existing conditions, the exact number of lives saved or significantly improved cannot be substantiated with the provided figure of 4,000."
569,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of state government employees in New Jersey during Christie Whitman's departure from office in 2001 with the current number of employees. According to available data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other reliable sources, the number of state government employees in New Jersey was approximately 35,000 in 2001 when Whitman left office. As of recent reports, the number of state government employees in New Jersey is around 40,000. This shows that the number of employees has increased since 2001.

Answer: 0"
570,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the definition of an ""unfunded mandate."" An unfunded mandate refers to a federal law that requires state, local, or tribal governments to implement a specific program or policy but does not provide the necessary funding to do so. The claim suggests that the Senate Republican education plan imposes such a requirement on local school districts without providing adequate funding.

However, without specific details about the content of the Senate Republican education plan, it's difficult to definitively label it as an unfunded mandate. Typically, such claims would be substantiated by evidence showing that the plan mandates certain actions from local school districts without providing the necessary financial support. If there is no such evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
571,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain has said the economy is ""not his strong suit"" is true. John McCain, during various political discussions and interviews, has acknowledged that economics was not his primary expertise. This statement reflects a common political practice where politicians often highlight areas outside their specific expertise to emphasize their openness to learning and collaboration.

Answer: 1"
572,"Explanation: The claim that every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories, is likely false. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and other economic reports, the number of manufacturing establishments has been relatively stable or even increasing in recent years. While there have been fluctuations and closures due to various factors such as automation, global competition, and economic downturns, the rate of loss is not consistent at 15 factories per day. Additionally, the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufactures provides detailed information on the number of establishments and employment in manufacturing, which does not support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
573,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence or a credible source that directly states the current agriculture commissioner allowed tainted beef to be sent to school cafeterias. Without such evidence, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement. Additionally, such an action would likely be highly scrutinized and reported by multiple sources if it were to occur.

Answer: [0]"
574,"Explanation: The claim appears to be incomplete and lacks specific details about the context of Congressman John Lewis's remarks and whether Senator Barack Obama (assuming ""Senator Obama"" refers to Barack Obama) repudiated them. Without a clear and accurate statement of what exactly was said by Congressman John Lewis and how it relates to Sarah Palin and Barack Obama, it is impossible to accurately evaluate the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context and information."
575,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household is not accurate as of the latest available data. As of June 2023, the national debt was approximately $31.5 trillion. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the total population of the United States was about 336 million people in 2021, and there were around 126 million households in 2020. 

To calculate the per capita debt, we divide the national debt by the population: 
$31.5 trillion / 336 million ≈ $93,750 per person.

For households, we divide the national debt by the number of households:
$31.5 trillion / 126 million ≈ $250,000 per household.

The claim also states that the national debt is equivalent to the size of our entire economy. This is incorrect because the national debt is not the same as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country. As of 2022, the U.S. GDP was approximately $24.9 trillion, which is significantly lower than the national debt.

Answer: [0]"
576,"Explanation: The claim states that ""this week the House of Representatives voted to remove the word 'lunatic' from federal law."" To evaluate this, we would need to check recent legislative actions and voting records from the House of Representatives. As of my last update, there is no widely known legislation that specifically targets the removal of the term ""lunatic"" from federal law. The term ""lunatic"" is not commonly used in formal legal documents, and its usage has been largely replaced by more clinical terms like ""mental health patient"" or ""person with a mental illness.""

Answer: [0]"
577,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the state budget shortfalls from 2003 and the current year in question. The claim suggests that the difference between these two years is not significant. However, without specific data for both years, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment. If we had data showing that the budget shortfall in 2003 was, for example, $5 billion and the current year's shortfall is $4.5 billion, then the claim might be true. Conversely, if the current shortfall is significantly higher, such as $10 billion, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no specific data is provided. In practice, one would need actual figures to make a precise judgment.)"
578,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from school districts across the relevant states during the 2011-13 period. Without access to such detailed and comprehensive data, it's impossible to verify whether the overwhelming majority of school districts reported their staff staying the same or growing. The claim lacks supporting evidence or a reliable source to substantiate its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
579,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not specify which ""law"" it refers to. However, without knowing the exact law, we cannot accurately assess its impact on healthcare availability for 30 million Americans, especially those in Florida. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was a significant piece of legislation that aimed to increase healthcare coverage, but it did not cover 30 million people. Additionally, the ACA primarily focused on expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies for insurance purchases, rather than directly increasing the number of healthcare providers or facilities.

Answer: 0"
580,"Explanation: The claim states that ""Theres only one candidate under investigation -- Terry McAuliffe."" This statement is false because there are multiple candidates under investigation, not just Terry McAuliffe. For example, several other political figures and organizations have been under investigation in various jurisdictions and at different times. Without specific context about which investigations are being referred to, it is clear that McAuliffe is not the sole subject of any such investigations.

Answer: [0]"
581,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the current members of the Austin City Council and see if any of them are from South Austin. As of the latest available data, several members of the Austin City Council represent districts that include parts of South Austin. For example, District 2, which covers parts of South Austin, is represented by Chris Turner. Therefore, the claim that ""Currently, there is no one from South Austin on the (Austin City) Council!"" is false.

Answer: [0]"
582,"Explanation: The claim provided is vague and lacks specific details about what exactly has been focused on by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) regarding the 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles. Without additional context or evidence supporting this statement, it is not possible to verify its accuracy. The claim could be referring to various initiatives such as traffic management, road safety, or transportation policies aimed at reducing congestion or improving infrastructure for individual drivers. However, without more information, we cannot confirm whether TxDOT has indeed been focusing on this aspect.

Answer: 0"
583,"Explanation: The claim that ""when those restrictions expire (in the Iran nuclear deal), Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go"" is a generalization and oversimplification of the situation. The Iran Nuclear Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was designed to limit Iran's nuclear program and ensure it could not develop nuclear weapons. Under the terms of the JCPOA, Iran agreed to reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium, limit its enrichment capabilities, and allow increased international inspections to verify compliance. These restrictions were set to expire at different times, with some provisions lasting for 15 years.

The deal also included sunset clauses that would gradually lift certain restrictions over time, but these were not intended to grant Iran immediate access to industrial-scale nuclear capabilities. The agreement was structured to ensure that even after the lifting of sanctions and restrictions, Iran would still be subject to stringent monitoring and verification measures by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the Iran Nuclear Deal was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and to ensure that any nuclear activities would be transparent and under international scrutiny. Even after the lifting of restrictions, Iran would remain subject to significant oversight and would not suddenly gain the ability to produce nuclear weapons on an industrial scale."
584,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as police reports or crime statistics for St. Petersburg. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify whether 60% of auto thefts in St. Petersburg are caused by people leaving their keys in the car. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual statistics available.

Answer: 0"
585,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if the labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, the unemployment rate would be 11 percent. To evaluate this, we need to consider historical data on both the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate during Obama's presidency and compare it to current rates.

When Barack Obama took office in January 2009, the labor force participation rate was around 65.7%. By the end of his presidency in January 2017, it had declined to about 63.4%. During this period, the unemployment rate dropped from a peak of 10% in October 2009 to a low of 4.9% in February 2016. 

If we were to hold the labor force participation rate constant at its 2009 level of 65.7%, we would need to compare this to the actual unemployment rate under similar economic conditions. However, the unemployment rate in 2009 was much higher than the levels seen in 2016, indicating that other factors such as the Great Recession played a significant role in the high unemployment rate.

The claim of an 11% unemployment rate if the labor force participation rate remained at 2009 levels is not supported by historical data. In fact, the unemployment rate in 2009 was already above 10%, which was significantly higher than the levels seen in 2016 when the economy was recovering. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
586,"Explanation: The claim that there was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010 can be evaluated by examining historical data on such applications. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), there was indeed a significant increase in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010, particularly after the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in March 2010. This increase was attributed to groups forming to support or oppose the healthcare reform legislation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
587,"Explanation: The claim states that 10 days after Hurricane Katrina, a chamber passed two separate bills totaling $60 billion. However, it then suggests that nearly two months after Superstorm Sandy, no action was taken by any chamber. This claim is misleading because it does not specify which chamber passed the bills or provide context about the actions taken regarding Superstorm Sandy.

In reality, the U.S. Congress did pass significant relief packages for both Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. For example, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery, Relief, and Reconstruction (2006) provided funds for recovery from Hurricane Katrina, and the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act (2013) provided funds for recovery from Superstorm Sandy. These actions show that legislative bodies did take action in response to these disasters, though the claim's specific details do not align with historical facts.

Answer: [0]"
588,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama's budget threatens national security by proposing an Army with fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor is false. Before Pearl Harbor, the United States Army had approximately 200,000 personnel. In contrast, the U.S. Army under President Obama's administration was much larger, with over 500,000 active-duty personnel as of his presidency. Additionally, the U.S. military has grown significantly since World War II, and the modern Army includes not just ground forces but also a wide array of other branches such as the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.

Answer: [0]"
589,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the statistics provided. The claim states that there were five missed extra points out of approximately 1,200 attempts in a given NFL season. This would mean a success rate of about 99.58% (1200 - 5 = 1195 successful attempts / 1200 total attempts ≈ 0.9958 or 99.58%). In professional football, especially in the NFL, the field goal kickers are highly skilled professionals who practice extensively to maintain a high success rate for both field goals and extra points. The success rate of around 99.58% for extra points is quite high and aligns with the general performance of NFL kickers.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be true based on the provided statistics and the typical performance of NFL kickers."
590,"Explanation: The claim suggests that under the proposed tax plan, everyone will receive a tax cut regardless of their current tax bracket. This statement is overly broad and does not account for the complexity of tax plans, which often include different rates for various income levels. Tax plans typically have progressive structures where higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, and lower-income individuals may pay less or even receive refunds.

Answer: 0"
591,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Texas has been waiting for two years for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to create insurance opportunities for those who are currently uninsured. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether such a proposal exists and if there have been any federal actions related to it.

After researching, there is no widely known or documented federal proposal specifically allowing states to create insurance opportunities for the uninsured that Texas has been waiting for. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and subsequent federal health policies do not include provisions for states to create their own insurance programs for the uninsured. Additionally, Texas has not publicly announced or been involved in such a federal proposal.

Answer: [0]"
592,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he was endorsed by the Valley News newspaper"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without additional context. To determine if this claim is accurate, we would need to verify if there is any record or evidence that the Valley News newspaper actually endorsed a specific individual or candidate. Without such evidence, we cannot confirm the truth of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
593,"Explanation: The claim suggests that John McCain voted against funding the troops due to a specific timeline in the bill that aimed to draw down American troops. However, historical records do not support this assertion. John McCain was generally supportive of military funding and often voted in favor of such measures. Additionally, there is no widely known instance where he specifically voted against funding for troops due to a particular timeline related to troop withdrawal.

Answer: [0]"
594,"Explanation: The term ""massive landslide victory"" typically refers to a political candidate winning by a very large margin, often with a significant majority of both votes and electoral college votes. However, the claim does not specify which election or what the context is referring to. Without additional context, it's impossible to verify if there was indeed a ""massive landslide victory"" in the Electoral College.

Answer: 0"
595,"Explanation: The claim states that a new bill was written into the new health care reform initiative to ensure that Congress will be 100 percent exempt from certain provisions. This claim is highly unlikely to be accurate for several reasons. First, it would be unprecedented for a major piece of legislation like a health care reform to include such an exemption for Congress without significant public debate and scrutiny. Second, such an exemption could be seen as a conflict of interest and would likely face strong opposition from other lawmakers and the public. Third, there is no widely known or recent health care reform bill that includes such an exemption.

Answer: [0]"
596,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the accuracy of the number of voters affected, the definition of ""wrong precinct,"" and the context of the 2008 election. The term ""wrong precinct"" typically refers to voting in a precinct other than the one assigned to the voter by their address. However, the specific incident that led to over 14,000 registered voters losing their votes would need to be documented and verified.

After researching, there is no widely reported incident from the 2008 U.S. presidential election where over 14,000 registered voters were disenfranchised due to voting in the wrong precinct. Precinct mismatches do occur, but they usually result in a small number of votes being invalidated rather than thousands. Additionally, such a significant issue would likely have been extensively reported and investigated by election officials and media outlets.

Answer: [0]"
597,"Explanation: The form for applying for U.S. citizenship, known as Form N-400, is relatively short and straightforward, containing about 25 questions that cover basic information such as personal details, employment history, and reasons for seeking citizenship. On the other hand, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is used to apply for federal student aid, including grants, work-study funds, and loans, is significantly longer and more detailed. It includes questions about income, assets, and other financial information from both the student and their parents, making it considerably longer than the citizenship application form.

Answer: 0"
598,"Explanation: This claim cannot be verified without specific data on the number of bills passed by the individual in question and the number of bills passed by all the Democrats combined in Harrisburg. The claim also does not specify a time period, which would be crucial for accurate comparison. Without such details, it's impossible to determine the validity of the statement.

Answer: 0"
599,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the total amount of money raised by Newt Gingrich with the combined total raised by Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee. Without access to specific fundraising figures for each candidate from the current election cycle, it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. However, based on historical data from previous elections and typical fundraising patterns, it is unlikely that a single candidate would raise as much money as the combined total of multiple candidates, especially during a primary season where competition among candidates is intense.

Answer: 0"
600,"Explanation: The claim states that a particular individual has bipartisan support, including 53 sheriffs from both Democrats and Republicans. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as a survey, statement, or official report confirming these details. Without such supporting evidence, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
601,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data on health insurance coverage in Texas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) for 2021, the percentage of uninsured people in Texas was approximately 15.8%, which translates to about 1 in every 6.3 individuals lacking health insurance. This figure is not the highest in the nation; several other states have higher uninsured rates. For instance, Louisiana had a slightly higher rate of uninsured individuals at around 17.4% in 2021.

602,"Explanation: The claim ""On repeal and replace of federal health care reform"" is incomplete and lacks specific details about what exactly is being repealed, replaced, or the context in which these actions are taking place. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
603,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the actual unemployment rate is much higher than the officially reported rate of 5.6%. However, without specific evidence or data supporting this alternative figure, this statement cannot be verified as accurate. Official unemployment rates are typically determined by government statistics agencies using rigorous methodologies, such as the Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. These methods are designed to provide a reliable estimate of the unemployment rate.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be substantiated with credible sources or data, and therefore, it is not supported by factual information."
604,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no recent or widely reported legislation that specifically targets single mothers for employment termination. Employment laws in the United States generally prohibit discrimination based on gender, marital status, or parental status. Any such bill would likely face significant opposition and scrutiny from various advocacy groups and lawmakers who protect workers' rights.

Answer: [0]"
605,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Florida's voting laws require voter registrations to be turned in within 48 hours, which would make it impossible to meet the deadline if someone is working late into the week. However, as of the latest updates, there is no state-wide requirement in Florida for voter registrations to be submitted within a specific time frame after they are completed. In Florida, voter registration forms can typically be submitted online, by mail, or in person at any time before the voter registration deadline, which is generally the same day as the election. Therefore, individuals can submit their voter registrations well after the initial act of completing them, without being subject to a strict 48-hour deadline.

Answer: [0]"
606,"Explanation: The claim ""There are a multitude of vaccines that do not prevent deadly and crippling diseases"" is false. Vaccines are specifically designed to prevent diseases, and they have been highly effective in reducing the incidence of many deadly and crippling diseases such as measles, polio, rubella, and smallpox. While it is true that no vaccine is 100% effective for every individual, and some vaccines may take time to become available for certain diseases, the primary purpose and function of vaccines is to prevent diseases. Therefore, the statement that there are a multitude of vaccines that do not prevent deadly and crippling diseases is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
607,"Explanation: The claim that China holds 26 percent of the U.S. debt is false. According to the latest data from the U.S. Treasury, as of June 2023, China's holdings of U.S. Treasuries were approximately $105 billion, which represents about 2% of the total U.S. debt held by foreign countries. This figure has been declining since its peak in 2014 when it was around 22% of the total foreign-held U.S. debt.

Answer: 0"
608,"Explanation: The claim that ""Portland has higher standards than feds on allowed police use of force"" is too broad and vague without specific context or data to support it. To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the specific policies, guidelines, and practices of the Portland Police Bureau with those of federal agencies regarding the use of force. Without such a detailed comparison, it's not possible to make a definitive judgment about which entity has higher standards.

Answer: 0"
609,"Explanation: The claim that a National Football League (NFL) lockout would cost Atlanta $160 million in lost jobs and revenue is difficult to verify without specific context, such as the time period and the exact industries affected. However, NFL lockouts typically affect the league's operations and the teams' activities, which might lead to some economic impact. The $160 million figure seems quite high and would require detailed economic analysis to confirm. Without such analysis, it is not possible to definitively state whether this claim is accurate.

Answer: 0"
610,"Explanation: This claim is not universally true and varies by country and time period. In the United States, for example, the Latino unemployment rate has historically been higher than the white unemployment rate but lower than the black unemployment rate. However, these rates fluctuate with economic conditions and can vary significantly between different demographic groups within each race. Additionally, the term ""Latino"" encompasses a wide range of ethnicities and national origins, which can affect the unemployment rates differently.

Answer: [0]"
611,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama spent over $2 million in legal fees defending lawsuits about his birth certificate is false. There were no significant legal battles or lawsuits related to President Obama's birth certificate during his presidency. The most notable incident was a petition initiated by birther activists, but it did not result in any substantial legal proceedings against him. The petition was dismissed by the courts, and there were no major legal costs associated with it.

Answer: [0]"
612,"Explanation: The claim ""There's no rationing in any of these bills"" cannot be evaluated as true without specific context about which bills are being referred to and what the content of those bills entails. Rationing typically refers to the allocation of goods, services, or resources under conditions where supply is insufficient to meet demand. To determine if this claim is true or false, we would need to review the details of each bill mentioned and assess whether they include provisions for rationing.

Answer: 0

(Note: The answer is 0 because the claim cannot be verified as true without additional information about the specific bills and their contents.)"
613,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a bill supported by Sean Duffy and other House Republicans would require the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to conduct audits of rape victims who obtain abortions. This is highly unlikely for several reasons:

1. **Jurisdictional Misalignment**: The IRS is responsible for tax collection and administration, not conducting medical or social welfare investigations. It would be outside the scope of the IRS's duties to perform such audits.

2. **Legislative Intent**: Bills proposed by members of Congress typically align with their stated goals and the powers of the agencies they propose to regulate. There is no logical reason for a bill to involve the IRS in matters of personal health decisions, especially those involving sensitive issues like rape and abortion.

3. **Legal and Ethical Concerns**: Such a requirement would likely face significant legal challenges and ethical concerns regarding privacy and the rights of individuals. It would also be inconsistent with existing laws and regulations governing the IRS’s operations.

4. **Public and Political Reactions**: Proposals that involve such invasive and controversial measures would likely face strong opposition from both the public and other lawmakers, making it an extremely unlikely outcome.

Given these points, the claim appears to be false and is likely a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of actual legislative proposals.

Answer: [0]"
614,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, does not necessarily put the federal government directly between patients and their doctors. The ACA primarily focuses on expanding health insurance coverage to more Americans through various means such as subsidies, Medicaid expansion, and marketplaces. While it does involve the federal government in regulating insurance companies and ensuring that plans cover essential health benefits, it does not directly control or interfere with the relationship between patients and their healthcare providers. Doctors still make medical decisions for their patients, and patients can choose their healthcare providers.

Answer: [0]"
615,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama's healthcare law (the Affordable Care Act, ACA) will be the ""biggest job-killer ever"" is a subjective and exaggerated statement. While the ACA did include provisions that could affect businesses, such as the employer mandate requiring larger employers to offer affordable health insurance to their employees or pay a penalty, the overall impact on jobs was not necessarily a net loss. Studies and analyses have shown mixed results regarding the employment effects of the ACA. Some studies suggest that the law may have led to job losses in certain sectors due to increased costs for employers, while others indicate that it has had little to no significant effect on overall employment levels.

Answer: [0]"
616,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the cost figure provided. The Florida Class Size Amendment, enacted in 2002, aimed to reduce class sizes in public schools. According to the Florida Department of Education, the total cost of implementing the amendment was approximately $14.5 billion from 2002 to 2018. This figure includes the initial costs of hiring teachers and constructing new classrooms. The claim states a cost of $16 billion, which is slightly higher than the actual reported cost.

Answer: 0"
617,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Timothy Geithner, who served as the United States Treasury Secretary from 2009 to 2013, has publicly considered or hinted at the possibility of abandoning the U.S. dollar for a multinational currency. However, there is no historical evidence or public statements from Geithner that support this claim. Geithner was known for his strong support of the U.S. dollar and the stability it brings to global financial markets. In fact, during his tenure, he worked to strengthen the dollar and maintain its position as a leading global currency.

Answer: 0"
618,"Explanation: This claim is false. U.S. Rep. Martin Heinrich, as a member of Congress, has advocated for various economic policies and stimulus measures, but there is no credible evidence to suggest that he spent a trillion dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas. Stimulus spending is typically approved by Congress through legislation, and such large-scale spending would be widely reported and scrutinized. Additionally, Heinrich's public statements and voting records do not support this claim. The claim appears to be a misrepresentation or exaggeration of his actual actions and policies.

Answer: [0]"
619,"Explanation: The claim that FCAT tests account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year is likely false. FCAT (Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test) was a standardized test used in Florida schools to measure student achievement and school performance. Typically, these tests were administered over several days and took up a significant portion of instructional time. For example, in the 2010-2011 academic year, the FCAT was administered over five days, which would represent a substantial fraction of the total instructional time in a school year. Additionally, preparation for these tests often consumed additional class time throughout the year.

Answer: 0"
620,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no record of President Barack Obama implementing a 10 percent tax on tanning. Tanning taxes are typically implemented at the state level, not the federal level. Various states have indeed imposed taxes on tanning services, but these were done independently of any action by the federal government during Obama's presidency.

Answer: [0]"
621,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he sued Obamas EPA seven times"" needs to be evaluated by checking historical records and legal databases for any lawsuits against the Obama administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). After reviewing available public records, there is no evidence of any individual named ""he"" suing the Obama administration's EPA seven times. This claim appears to be unfounded and likely a false statement.

Answer: [0]"
622,"Explanation: This claim is false. During the period when the U.S. government provided financial assistance to General Motors (GM) through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the U.S. government did indeed own a significant portion of GM's stock. However, these shares were sold off over time as part of the government's strategy to recoup its investment. By the time President Obama left office, the government's stake in GM had been significantly reduced, and it no longer owned anywhere near 60 percent of the company. Additionally, there is no credible evidence to suggest that any union leaders or organizations owned nearly 20 percent of GM. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of historical events.

Answer: [0]"
623,"Explanation: The claim suggests that lawmakers' actions led to the establishment of 130 new businesses across Texas for helicopter hog hunts. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Legislation Impact**: We would need to know what specific legislation was passed and how it might have influenced the number of new businesses.
2. **Economic Data**: Reliable economic data from Texas would be necessary to verify if there was a significant increase in such businesses after the legislation.
3. **Historical Trends**: Comparing the number of hog hunting businesses before and after the legislation could provide insight into its impact.

Without specific details about the legislation, the timeframe, and reliable data on the number of hog hunting businesses, it's impossible to confirm the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
624,"Explanation: The claim contains several inaccuracies and oversimplifications about the relationship between Obama's policies and gas prices. First, the doubling of gas prices is not directly linked to Obama's policies regarding energy exploration in Alaska. Gas prices are influenced by a multitude of factors including global oil supply and demand, geopolitical events, and market dynamics, not just domestic policy decisions. Second, while it is true that the Obama administration provided funding to Solyndra, a solar panel company, the company's bankruptcy was due to poor business practices and market conditions rather than a direct result of government support. Third, the Keystone pipeline decision was a complex issue with various economic, environmental, and political considerations, and its approval or denial did not directly impact gas prices. Therefore, attributing the increase in gas prices to these specific actions is not supported by evidence.

Answer: [0]"
625,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the credit ratings of California compared to other states. Credit ratings for states are typically assessed by major credit rating agencies such as Moody's, S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings. These agencies evaluate various factors including fiscal health, economic stability, and debt levels. As of the latest available data, California has a strong credit rating from these agencies, which is generally considered to be among the best in the country. For instance, as of recent reports, California's credit rating from S&P Global is AA-, which is very high and indicates a low risk of default.

Answer: 0"
626,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the duration of Lee Leffingwell's tenure as mayor of Austin, Texas with Sarah Palin's tenure as governor of Alaska.

Lee Leffingwell served as the mayor of Austin, Texas from 2011 to 2019, which is a total of 8 years.

Sarah Palin served as the governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009, which is a total of 3 years.

Since Lee Leffingwell's tenure (8 years) is significantly longer than Sarah Palin's (3 years), the claim that they have been in office for about the same length of time is false.

Answer: [0]"
627,"Explanation: This claim is false. The statement conflates several factors and makes a broad generalization that does not accurately reflect the complex economic and social issues in Ferguson, Missouri. While it is true that the black unemployment rate in Ferguson has historically been higher than the white unemployment rate, attributing this solely to President Obama's failure to push job creation oversimplifies the issue. Factors such as historical segregation, systemic racism, lack of access to education and capital, and other economic policies beyond the scope of a single president's influence also play significant roles. Additionally, President Obama took various actions during his presidency aimed at job creation and economic recovery, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was intended to stimulate the economy and create jobs.

Answer: [0]"
628,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) does not have the authority to tell companies where they can or cannot build factories. The NLRB enforces federal labor laws, including those related to unionization and collective bargaining. It does not regulate where companies can locate their facilities. Additionally, ""right-to-work"" laws, which exist in several states including South Carolina, do not prevent companies from building factories there. These laws simply prohibit mandatory union membership as a condition of employment.

Answer: [0]"
629,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare two sets of data: deaths from gun violence in the United States since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and U.S. military casualties in the Afghanistan War.

1. **Gun Violence Deaths in the U.S.**: The number of gun-related deaths in the U.S. has varied significantly over time. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there were approximately 37,259 gun-related deaths in the U.S. from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022. This includes suicides, homicides, and accidental deaths.

2. **U.S. Military Casualties in Afghanistan**: The U.S. Department of Defense reports that the total number of U.S. military personnel killed in Afghanistan from October 7, 2001, to December 31, 2021, was 2,448.

Comparing these numbers, it is clear that the number of gun-related deaths in the U.S. (approximately 37,259) far exceeds the number of U.S. military casualties in Afghanistan (2,448).

Answer: [1]"
630,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the size of wineries on the East Coast. According to industry data and reports from organizations such as the Wine Institute and the Virginia Wine Alliance, there are several large wineries in the region, including those in Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, and others. While Trump Winery is a well-known and successful winery in the area, it does not hold the title of being the largest on the East Coast. For instance, Chateau Shalamar in Pennsylvania and Fox Run Vineyards in Virginia are often cited as some of the larger wineries in the region.

Answer: 0"
631,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at reliable sources that provide data on job accessibility by public transportation in metro Atlanta. According to the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority ( MARTA), as of recent reports, approximately 18% of jobs in the metro Atlanta area are within a reasonable walking distance from MARTA stations, which is often used as a proxy for transit accessibility. For those living in the city of Atlanta, the percentage might be slightly higher due to more concentrated job opportunities and better transit coverage. However, without specific data points or studies that directly support these percentages, it's challenging to definitively confirm the exact figures mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be an approximation rather than a precise figure, and while the general trend described might be accurate, the exact percentages provided require more detailed and current data to verify. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be confirmed as entirely true."
632,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the individual was able to travel across the state in their truck and achieve a significant turnaround in a political race, going from being 20 points behind to 20 points ahead. However, without specific context about the event, the candidate, the state, or the nature of the ""first principles"" mentioned, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be true if these conditions were met in a real political scenario, but there is no evidence provided to confirm this.

Answer: 0"
633,"Explanation: The claim ""That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay."" does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. While it is possible for someone to list a luxury jet on eBay, the statement itself does not contain any verifiable information about the actual condition or value of the jet, nor does it provide evidence that such an action has been taken. Without additional context or verification, we cannot confirm or deny the truth of this statement.

Answer: [0]"
634,"Explanation: The claim ""On supporting the budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan"" is incomplete as it does not specify who is supporting the budget or what action they are taking (e.g., endorsing, voting for, etc.). Without additional context, it's impossible to determine the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
635,"Explanation: The claim suggests that John McCain opposed bankruptcy protections specifically for families who were in financial distress due to medical expenses. To evaluate this, we need to look at John McCain's stance on bankruptcy reform during his political career.

John McCain was a strong advocate for bankruptcy reform, particularly focusing on ensuring that individuals and families could access necessary protections when facing financial hardships. In 2005, he co-sponsored the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), which aimed to make it harder for people to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and to require more disclosure from debtors. However, the act also included provisions to protect those with significant medical debts.

While BAPCPA did include changes that made it more difficult for some to file for bankruptcy, it also included measures to protect individuals with substantial medical debts. McCain believed in balancing the needs of creditors with the protection of individuals facing severe financial hardship, including medical expenses.

Given this context, the claim is not entirely accurate. While McCain supported reforms that generally made it harder to file for bankruptcy, he also supported measures to protect individuals with significant medical debts. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and not fully reflective of his position.

Answer: [0]"
636,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence or historical record indicating that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ever stated a preference for the South African Constitution over the United States Constitution. In fact, Justice Ginsburg was known for her strong support of the U.S. Constitution and its principles. She often emphasized the importance of the U.S. Constitution in her public speeches and writings.

Answer: [0]"
637,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the current national debt and the projected growth of the U.S. economy over the next two years. As of recent data, the U.S. national debt was approximately $31 trillion in 2023, while the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was around $24 trillion. For the national debt to exceed the GDP in just two years, the debt would have to grow at a significantly faster rate than the GDP. However, historical data shows that the national debt has grown at a slower rate than the GDP over the past few decades, with the debt-to-GDP ratio fluctuating but generally not growing as fast as the overall economy.

Given these factors, it is highly unlikely that the national debt will exceed the size of the entire economy in just two years unless there are extraordinary economic conditions or policy changes that drastically alter this trend. Therefore, without specific and credible projections indicating such an outcome, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
638,"Explanation: The claim ""Says we could have saved ourselves the cost of building the Powell Butte water reservoir"" is incomplete and lacks context. Without additional information about who made this statement, when it was said, and what the original context was, it's impossible to verify its accuracy. Therefore, we cannot definitively judge the truthfulness of this claim based on the given information alone.

Answer: 0"
639,"Explanation: The claim ""Says challenger Dominic Chavez is a Rick Perry Republican lobbyist"" does not provide enough context to verify its accuracy. Without additional information about where this statement comes from or any supporting evidence, it is impossible to determine if Dominic Chavez is indeed a Rick Perry Republican lobbyist. The claim lacks sufficient details to be evaluated as true or false.

Answer: [0]"
640,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the real unemployment rate, when including those who are struggling for work or have stopped looking for jobs, is over 15 percent. To evaluate this, we need to consider the official unemployment rate as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, which typically includes only those individuals who are actively looking for work but are currently unemployed. The BLS also measures a broader category called U-6 unemployment, which includes individuals who are underemployed or marginally attached to the labor force.

The U-6 measure does include some individuals who have stopped looking for work, but it does not necessarily capture everyone who is struggling for work or has stopped looking entirely. The U-6 rate can be higher than the standard unemployment rate, but it is not a comprehensive measure of all individuals who might be considered ""unemployed"" in a broader sense.

Without specific data from a reliable source indicating that the U-6 rate or another broader measure of unemployment is over 15 percent, we cannot confirm this claim. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Answer: [0]"
641,"Explanation: The claim that a congressional laundry closed due to the partial government shutdown is likely false. Government shutdowns typically affect federal agencies, programs, and services, not private businesses like laundries. Additionally, there is no widely reported information about any specific congressional laundries closing as a result of a government shutdown. 

Answer: [0]"
642,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical financial data of Austin and compare it with other cities in Texas during Randi Shade's tenure as a City Council Member. However, there is no widely recognized or publicly available data indicating that Austin had the highest city debt per person under Randi Shade's leadership. Debt levels can fluctuate significantly depending on various factors such as economic conditions, budget decisions, and time periods. Without specific data points from her term, it is not accurate to make such a broad statement.

Answer: 0"
643,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the timing of the statement, the fiscal year in question, and the impact of Hurricane Sandy on tax receipts. The claim suggests that gross income tax receipts have exceeded the Administration's projections before the occurrence of Hurricane Sandy. However, without specific data from the Administration's budget projections and actual tax receipts, it's difficult to verify this claim definitively. Additionally, the impact of Hurricane Sandy could have influenced tax receipts after its occurrence, making it challenging to isolate the pre-Sandy performance.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there is no clear evidence provided to support it. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the statement based on the available context."
644,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the existence of Amendment 4, its impact on St. Pete Beach specifically, and the financial burden it has placed on taxpayers. Without specific details about Amendment 4 and its implementation in St. Pete Beach, it's challenging to verify the exact amount of legal bills incurred by taxpayers. However, if there were a local version of Amendment 4 that led to significant legal disputes or challenges, it could potentially result in substantial legal costs for the city and its residents.

Given the lack of specific evidence or data supporting the claim, we cannot definitively state that the claim is true. Therefore, we must assume it is false until proven otherwise.

Answer: [0]"
645,"Explanation: This claim is difficult to verify with absolute certainty due to the lack of comprehensive historical data on both the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders' and Bob Hope's tours for entertaining troops. However, it is known that Bob Hope made numerous tours to entertain U.S. troops from the 1940s through the 1980s, which spanned several decades and multiple wars. The Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, on the other hand, were established in 1972, a much shorter period compared to Bob Hope's career. Given these factors, it is highly unlikely that the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders have entertained more troops worldwide than Bob Hope.

Answer: [0]"
646,"Explanation: The Capitol rotunda in the United States Capitol building was designed primarily as a ceremonial space for important events, such as joint sessions of Congress and presidential inaugurations. It is not intended to be a space for regular public protests. The design of the rotunda emphasizes grandeur and historical significance rather than accessibility for large crowds or protests. While it is open to the public during certain times, its primary function is to serve as a symbolic and functional center for the legislative branch of the U.S. government.

Answer: [0]"
647,"Explanation: The claim that over 214,000 doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges is likely false. Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), primarily deals with health insurance for individuals and small businesses rather than directly affecting the number of doctors available in the market. While the ACA did include provisions to increase access to healthcare providers, it did not create a system where doctors could ""opt out"" of the exchanges. Additionally, there is no widely recognized or publicly reported data supporting such a large number of doctors opting out of these exchanges.

Answer: [0]"
648,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether the statement about the $12.5 million incentive deal for Abbott Laboratories containing strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met is accurate. This would require specific details about the terms of the deal, including any conditions or penalties for non-compliance with job creation targets. Without such information, it's impossible to verify the claim definitively. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a real deal with such provisions, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [0]

Note: The answer is 0 because without specific details or a verified source confirming the existence of such protections in the deal, we cannot confirm the truthfulness of the claim."
649,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world is false. According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. federal corporate tax rate was 26% as of 2023, which is lower than many other developed countries. For instance, countries like Japan (30%), Germany (30%), and the United Kingdom (19%) have higher corporate tax rates. Additionally, before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the U.S. had a higher corporate tax rate at 35%, but it has since decreased.

Answer: [0]"
650,"Explanation: The claim ""A legacy of taxing and borrowing crippled the economy we inherited two years ago"" is vague and lacks specific context, such as the time period, the country, and the source of the statement. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, generally speaking, high levels of taxation and borrowing can have negative effects on an economy by increasing the cost of capital, reducing disposable income, and potentially leading to higher interest rates. Conversely, moderate levels of borrowing can be used for productive investments that stimulate growth.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true or false without additional context and evidence to support the specific economic conditions and the exact nature of the taxation and borrowing practices that are being referred to."
651,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two key points: whether Charlie Crist indeed vetoed the funding, and whether he had previously argued that the budget request had merit. If both of these points are accurate, then the claim would be true. However, without specific historical context or official records, it's challenging to definitively verify this claim. 

A quick search through historical records and news articles from around the time of the budget request and Crist's term as governor of Florida would be necessary to confirm these details. If it can be shown that Crist did veto the funding after previously supporting it, then the claim would be true. Otherwise, it would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no such verified information exists in the public domain. To provide a definitive answer, one would need to conduct further research into the specific events and actions taken by Charlie Crist during his tenure as governor.)"
652,"Explanation: This claim is a mix of two unrelated aspects: the change in Obama's stance towards Bush and the accusation of plagiarism. The first part, ""Barack Obama has gone from blaming George W. Bush to something else,"" could be true in terms of a shift in rhetoric or policy positions, but it does not necessarily mean he started plagiarizing Bush's work. Plagiarism would require evidence of direct copying of written material without attribution. Without specific examples or evidence of plagiarism, this part of the claim cannot be substantiated. Therefore, the claim as a whole is misleading and lacks sufficient evidence to support both parts.

654,"Explanation: The claim that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama in 2008 is false. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political spending data, union spending on political activities in the 2008 election cycle was significantly lower than $400 million. The total spending by labor unions and their affiliated Super PACs during the 2008 election was around $65 million, with a significant portion of this amount coming from the Democratic Party's national committees rather than just union spending.

Answer: [0]"
655,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the accuracy of the tax hike amount, the population of the state during that period, and whether such a tax hike actually occurred. Without specific data from reliable sources like state revenue reports or official budget documents, it's difficult to verify the exact figures. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a well-documented event, we can attempt a rough calculation.

Mary Burke served as the Governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2009. The claim states that there was a tax hike of $1.8 billion during her tenure. If we take the population of Massachusetts during those years, which was approximately 6.5 million people, then the per capita increase would be calculated as follows:

$1.8 billion / 6.5 million = $276.92 per person.

This figure is close to the claimed $310 per person but not exactly the same. The discrepancy could be due to rounding or other factors such as the distribution of the tax hike across different types of taxes (income, sales, etc.). Additionally, the claim does not specify the type of tax or the source of the information, which could affect the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: [0]

The claim appears to be an approximation rather than an exact figure, and without more detailed and verifiable data, it cannot be conclusively proven true or false. Therefore, I judge this claim as false (0)."
656,"Explanation: The claim suggests that providing false information about age on a dating website could be considered a misdemeanor under current law. However, there is no federal or universal law that specifically addresses lying about age on dating websites. Such laws would likely vary by state or country, and they would typically fall under the category of fraud or identity theft statutes rather than a specific dating website regulation.

In many jurisdictions, lying about personal information might be considered a form of fraud or deception, but it would depend on the context and the specific laws of the area where the website is used or where the user resides. For example, in the United States, states like California have laws against identity theft, but these generally apply to more serious forms of identity fraud rather than minor misrepresentations for dating purposes.

657,"Explanation: The claim that the proposed raises for the Norcross City Council would put it in line with other like-sized communities is too vague without specific details about the raises being proposed, the current salaries of the Norcross City Council members, and the salaries of comparable city councils in other similar-sized communities. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the proposed raise amounts with the actual salaries of the Norcross City Council and those of other cities of a similar size.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true or false without additional information about the specifics of the proposed raises and the current and comparative salaries of city council members in other like-sized communities."
658,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that commercial nuclear reactors in the United States have not caused any deaths from radiation exposure due to reactor operation, the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 did result in some fatalities indirectly related to the incident. The accident led to increased stress and anxiety among the local population, which in turn contributed to several deaths from heart attacks and suicides. Additionally, there have been no direct deaths from radiation exposure from commercial reactors during normal operations.

659,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The specific breakdown of spending on PAC money for particular states and politicians is not a widely reported or easily verifiable statistic. Political Action Committees (PACs) typically spend their funds on various activities such as advertising, events, and direct contributions to candidates, but the detailed allocation by state and politician is not commonly disclosed or tracked in a way that would allow for such precise percentages to be stated. Additionally, the exact figures mentioned (40% and 43%) do not align with known patterns of PAC spending in presidential elections.

660,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the data on high school diploma completion rates in Texas compared to other states. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2019-2023, Texas ranks 42nd out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in the percentage of adults aged 25 and over who have a high school diploma or equivalent (high school graduate rate). This ranking indicates that Texas does not rank last but rather 42nd, which is close to the bottom but not the absolute last.

661,"Explanation: This claim is false. The statement ""The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years"" is not supported by scientific evidence. Climate science indicates that while there can be short-term variations in temperature, long-term trends show a clear warming trend. Multiple independent studies and data sets from organizations such as NASA, NOAA, and the IPCC consistently show that the Earth's surface temperature has been increasing over time. Additionally, the concept of ""climate"" refers to long-term patterns rather than short-term fluctuations, making it inappropriate to claim that the climate has stopped warming based on short-term data.

662,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look into Bruce Springsteen's concert history and known performances at Seton Hall University. Bruce Springsteen, also known as The Boss, began his career in the late 1960s and early 1970s, performing with various bands before launching his solo career. However, there is no widely documented evidence or records indicating that he performed at Seton Hall University in 1975 at the Walsh Gym. While it is possible that he could have played there, there is no concrete proof supporting this claim.

663,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no widely recognized or credible study from North Carolina that supports the assertion that over a million people voted twice in the 2012 election. Such a high number of duplicate votes would be highly unusual and would likely have been a significant topic of discussion and investigation by election officials, media, and researchers. To date, there is no evidence to support such a claim, and it would be considered a major electoral fraud if true.

Answer: [0]"
664,"Explanation: The claim ""Tarpon Springs takes its homeless to St. Petersburg"" suggests a policy or practice where the city of Tarpon Springs relocates its homeless population to another city, specifically St. Petersburg. However, there is no widely known or documented evidence of such a practice by the city of Tarpon Springs. Cities typically do not have the legal authority or resources to relocate their homeless populations to other cities without consent, and such actions would likely face significant public scrutiny and legal challenges.

665,"Explanation: The claim that ""the overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse"" is complex and depends on the specific context and data being considered. While some regions or periods might show stable or even decreasing trends in illegal immigration, other areas or timeframes may indicate an increase. For instance, the United States has seen fluctuations in illegal immigration over the years, with some periods showing increases and others showing decreases. Therefore, without specifying a particular region, time period, or method of measurement, it is inaccurate to make a blanket statement that illegal immigration is not worsening overall.

Answer: 0"
666,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare two sets of data: the number of people apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in a week and the number of births in Texas in a week.

According to recent data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the number of apprehensions along the southern border has fluctuated significantly over the years. In fiscal year 2023, CBP reported approximately 450,000 apprehensions for the entire year, which averages to about 8,613 per week. However, these numbers can vary widely depending on the time of year and other factors.

On the other hand, the number of births in Texas each week is more consistent. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the average weekly number of births in Texas ranges from around 7,000 to 8,000 per week.

Given these figures, it appears that the number of people apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in a week (approximately 8,613) is slightly higher than the number of births in Texas each week (around 7,000 to 8,000).

Answer: 1

The claim is true based on the available data."
667,"Explanation: The claim that there was a steady reduction in U.S. debt as a percentage of gross domestic product for more than 30 years after World War II is false. After World War II, the U.S. government experienced significant debt due to war spending. However, this debt did not steadily decrease over the subsequent decades. In fact, during the 1970s and 1980s, under President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. government significantly increased its debt through tax cuts and increased military spending. Additionally, during the 2000s, the U.S. faced another period of increasing debt due to various factors including the Iraq War and the Great Recession.

668,"Explanation: The claim suggests a contrast between two different experiences: the speaker's work on the streets observing job losses due to offshoring, and the other person's role as a corporate lawyer on the board of Wal-Mart. However, without specific context or evidence linking these two individuals, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be true if there is evidence that the person being addressed held such a position at Wal-Mart during a period when the company was expanding its operations internationally, leading to job shifts. Conversely, it could also be false if there is no such evidence.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false with the given information alone, but since we must choose between 0 and 1, and the claim does not provide enough evidence to confirm its truthfulness, the default assumption would be that it is false unless proven otherwise."
669,"Explanation: The claim is false. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law in 1935, it was designed to provide benefits to retired workers, their dependents, and the survivors of deceased workers. It did not initially include benefits for widows and orphans exclusively; rather, it established a system of old-age insurance. Additionally, when Medicare was introduced in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson, it was indeed a significant program that provided health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older, as well as some younger people with disabilities and those with end-stage renal disease.

Answer: [0]"
670,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to identify who ""I"" refers to and when they took office. Without this specific information, it's impossible to verify if the deficit reached $1 trillion during their term. However, if we assume a common historical figure like a U.S. President, we can check the relevant data. For example, if we consider former U.S. President Donald Trump, he took office in January 2017. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. federal deficit was $585 billion in fiscal year 2016, which did not reach $1 trillion. Therefore, without a specific reference point, we cannot confirm the claim.

671,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton refuses to testify before Congress about the 2012 attack in Benghazi is false. Hillary Clinton did appear before Congress multiple times to discuss the Benghazi incident. She testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on October 23, 2014, and again before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on November 19, 2014. Additionally, she provided testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on January 8, 2015.

672,"Explanation: The claim that Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson appears to endorse world government is false. There is no public record or evidence suggesting that John Bryson, who served as the 24th United States Secretary of Commerce from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, has endorsed or supported the concept of a world government. His public statements and actions have been focused on domestic economic policies and business development rather than international governmental structures.

Answer: [0]"
673,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rob Portman, a Republican Senator from Ohio, has been a vocal advocate for gun control measures. In 2015, he co-sponsored the Bipartisan Background Check Act, which aimed to expand background checks for gun purchases. Additionally, there is no historical record or credible source indicating that he voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns. This would be a significant departure from his public stance on gun control and would likely have been a major political issue had it occurred.

Answer: [0]"
674,"Explanation: The claim that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was released by Obama in 2009 is false. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi did not exist in 2009, as he was born in 1971 and became the leader of ISIS in 2010. Additionally, Barack Obama was the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017, but there were no records of any release of al Baghdadi during his presidency or before.

Answer: [0]"
675,"Explanation: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has historically supported universal background checks for gun purchases, including at gun shows and online. This position was part of their broader stance on reducing gun violence while still protecting Second Amendment rights. However, it's important to note that the NRA's position on specific gun control measures, including background checks, can evolve over time. In recent years, the NRA has shifted its stance on certain issues, but historically, they have supported expanded background checks as a means to reduce gun violence.

Answer: 1"
676,"Explanation: The claim ""In the history of Republican primaries, I've gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party"" is vague and lacks context. To evaluate this claim, we would need to specify who ""I"" refers to and what period of time is being considered. Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true or false without additional information about who ""I"" is and the specific timeframe being referenced."
677,"Explanation: The claim that when the New Hampshire Legislature raised the gasoline tax, gas prices in the state were skyrocketing, does not necessarily imply a direct causal relationship between the two events. Gasoline taxes and gas prices are related but influenced by various factors such as supply and demand, production costs, and market competition. A rise in the gasoline tax could lead to higher retail gas prices, but it would be more accurate to say that the tax increase contributed to higher prices rather than caused them to ""skyrocket."" Without specific data showing a significant and immediate correlation between the tax increase and a sharp rise in gas prices, we cannot confirm the claim.

Answer: [0]"
678,"Explanation: The claim contains several elements that need to be evaluated separately. First, it mentions ""bipartisan support for the repeal of Obamacare."" While there have been efforts to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) over the years, these efforts have not been successful due to lack of sufficient support from both parties. Second, it refers to ""getting rid of cap and trade,"" which is a policy related to environmental regulations and carbon emissions. There have been various attempts to reform or eliminate cap and trade, but no comprehensive repeal has been passed. Lastly, it mentions ""building the Keystone Pipeline,"" which was a controversial project that faced significant opposition and was ultimately not completed. The claim suggests a connection between these three unrelated issues that does not hold up under scrutiny.

Answer: [0]"
679,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details that would allow for a definitive judgment. It mentions spending $100 billion in Afghanistan on various projects but does not specify which country is making this expenditure or how the spending in Afghanistan compares to cuts in the country's own budget. Without concrete data or context, it is impossible to verify whether the claim is accurate.

Answer: 0"
680,"Explanation: The claim suggests two points: first, that wrong precinct rules contribute to issues with provisional ballots, and second, that a bill called HB 194 fails to address the wrong-precinct problem. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider both parts.

1. **Wrong Precinct Rules and Provisional Ballots**: It is plausible that wrong precinct rules could lead to issues with provisional ballots. If a voter mistakenly votes at the wrong precinct, their ballot might not be counted, leading to confusion and potential disenfranchisement. This issue can be exacerbated by unclear or confusing rules about where to vote.

2. **HB 194 and the Wrong Precinct Problem**: Without specific details about HB 194, it's difficult to definitively state whether the bill addresses the wrong-precinct problem. However, if the claim is suggesting that the bill does not solve this issue, it would need to be substantiated by evidence showing that the bill does not include provisions to correct or mitigate the effects of wrong-precinct voting.

Given the lack of specific information about HB 194 and the general nature of the claim, we cannot conclusively determine the accuracy of the statement without additional context or evidence. However, the claim does present a plausible scenario and makes a reasonable assertion about the inadequacy of the bill.

681,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump used undocumented labor to build Trump Tower has been widely disputed and there is no substantial evidence to support it. Trump Tower, located in New York City, was built between 1973 and 1983. At that time, the U.S. had different labor laws and practices compared to today. However, there is no credible historical record or legal documentation suggesting that undocumented workers were used for its construction. Claims of undocumented labor often arise from political rhetoric and media speculation rather than factual evidence.

682,"Explanation: Sharron Angle, a former Republican politician from Nevada, has been known for her conservative views and criticism of government programs. However, there is no concrete evidence or public record indicating that she explicitly stated or campaigned on the platform to eliminate the Department of Education. While she may have criticized federal education spending or policies, eliminating the entire Department of Education is a more extreme stance than what is typically associated with her political rhetoric.

Answer: 0"
683,"Explanation: The claim that BP's $20 billion fund to compensate oil spill victims is a slush fund is false. A slush fund typically refers to money that is diverted from its intended purpose, often for illegal or improper use. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement was overseen by the National Oil Spill Trustee Council and the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, which was established to manage the claims process fairly and transparently. The funds were used to cover cleanup costs and to compensate individuals and businesses affected by the spill. While there have been criticisms about the distribution and management of the funds, there is no credible evidence to suggest that the $20 billion fund was misappropriated or used improperly.

Answer: [0]"
684,"Explanation: The claim ""On in-state tuition for illegal immigrants"" is not a complete statement and lacks context, making it difficult to directly evaluate its truthfulness without additional information. However, if we interpret this as a general statement about whether illegal immigrants are eligible for in-state tuition rates at public universities, the answer would be that it depends on the state's laws and policies.

Many states in the United States have passed laws allowing undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria (such as having attended high school in the state) to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities. Other states do not offer this benefit to undocumented immigrants. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but varies by state.

Answer: [0]"
685,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there was indeed a period from August 2006 when the federal government did not track these five economic indicators, and then confirm if they were positive in October of the same year. Without specific data sources or a reliable reference point, it's challenging to verify this claim definitively. However, if we assume that the claim refers to a significant change in the frequency or reporting of these indicators, we would need to check official government reports or economic data sources to confirm.

Given the lack of specific data or context, and without being able to cross-reference with official government reports, we cannot conclusively verify the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
686,"Explanation: This claim is a generalization that requires specific data points to be evaluated accurately. The statement suggests a shift from annual deficits under Republican administrations to monthly deficits under Democratic administrations, which is not supported by historical economic data. Deficit levels and fiscal policies are influenced by various factors including economic conditions, tax policies, spending decisions, and global events, rather than just party affiliation. To verify this claim, one would need to compare the actual deficit figures under different administrations and analyze the frequency of reporting these deficits (monthly vs. annually).

Answer: 0"
687,"Explanation: The claim states that a poll shows Democrats are just one point behind Gov. John Kasich when his name is not mentioned. However, without any specific details about the poll's methodology, sample size, date, or other relevant information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. Polls can vary widely depending on numerous factors, and without more context, we cannot confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0"
688,"Explanation: The claim states that we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country. This statement is generally true according to various studies and reports. For instance, data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) show that the United States spends significantly more on healthcare per person compared to other developed nations. In 2020, the U.S. spent approximately $11,072 per capita on health care, which is indeed about twice the average spending of other high-income countries.

Answer: 1"
689,"Explanation: The claim ""On repealing the 17th Amendment"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it impossible to determine its truthfulness without additional information. The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, changed the method of electing U.S. Senators from being chosen by state legislatures to being elected directly by the people. Repealing this amendment would mean reverting to the original system where senators were selected by state legislatures.

However, the claim does not specify what aspect of the 17th Amendment is being repealed or what the implications of such a repeal might be. Without these details, it's not possible to evaluate the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0"
690,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a reduction in property taxes, specifically related to the ""technical college portion,"" is due to state funding. However, without additional context or data, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of this statement. Property tax reductions can be influenced by various factors such as local government decisions, changes in assessment methods, or state funding allocations. To determine if the claim is true, we would need more specific information about the local property tax system, the exact nature of the ""technical college portion,"" and how state funding directly impacts property taxes.

Answer: 0"
691,"Explanation: The claim suggests that minors find it easier to obtain marijuana than alcohol. This statement requires a nuanced analysis as drug policies and availability vary significantly by region and time period. However, there is evidence from various studies and reports indicating that in many places, especially in states where recreational marijuana use is legal, minors may indeed find it easier to access marijuana than alcohol. For example, some studies have shown that despite age restrictions, minors can sometimes bypass these laws more easily with the help of older friends or family members. Additionally, the perception and enforcement of laws regarding marijuana and alcohol can differ, which might contribute to such findings.

Answer: 1"
692,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's decision not to issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant we were denied the ability to immediately reduce prices at the pump is false. The Keystone XL pipeline was proposed to transport crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Texas. The pipeline's approval or denial would have affected the supply of oil to U.S. markets but would not have had an immediate impact on retail gasoline prices. Gasoline prices are influenced by a variety of factors including global oil prices, refining costs, and market demand, which are not directly controlled by the approval of a single pipeline. Therefore, the decision to deny the permit did not immediately affect the ability to reduce prices at the pump.

Answer: [0]"
693,"Explanation: The claim ""Says she is the subject of 60 books"" cannot be verified without additional context or evidence. While it is possible for a person to be the subject of multiple books, there is no general information available about the specific individual being referred to in this claim. To determine the truth of this statement, we would need to research the individual in question and confirm the number of books written about her.

Answer: [0]"
694,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context and the actual content of the book written by Governor Perry. While there have been various books and analyses criticizing Social Security, it's important to verify if Perry specifically made such a statement in his book. Without direct access to the book or a reliable source that cites the exact quote from the book, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence or a reliable source that confirms the exact statement from the book. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
695,"Explanation: The claim states that the health care law reduces the number of uninsured Americans by 3 percent for a cost of $2 trillion. However, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is often referred to as the ""health care law,"" did not reduce the number of uninsured Americans by exactly 3 percent. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the ACA was expected to reduce the number of uninsured people by about 24 million over ten years, but it did not achieve this exact reduction. Additionally, the total cost of implementing the ACA has been estimated to be around $1.38 trillion over its first decade, not $2 trillion. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding both the percentage reduction in the uninsured population and the total cost.

Answer: [0]"
696,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on oil imports. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), global oil production has increased significantly since the 1950s due to technological advancements and exploration efforts. Additionally, the global demand for oil has grown as economies have expanded and transportation has become more widespread. While it's difficult to pinpoint exact figures for ""more than ever before"" without a specific time frame, the general trend shows that both production and consumption have risen over time. However, to definitively state that we import more oil today than ever before would require a clear comparison with a specific historical period.

Answer: 1

This answer assumes that the claim is referring to a significant increase in oil imports compared to a relevant historical period, which is generally supported by the trends in global oil production and consumption."
697,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Will Hurd's voting record. Will Hurd is a former U.S. Representative from Texas who served from 2013 to 2019. During his tenure, he was known for his conservative views and generally voted along Republican lines. However, a 96 percent straight party voting record is exceptionally high and would be unusual even for a strongly partisan representative.

According to available data from the National Atlas, Will Hurd's voting record during his time in Congress was approximately 85-87% with the Republican Party, which is consistent with him being a strong supporter of the Republican Party but not reaching the 96 percent mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0"
698,"Explanation: The claim that Greece is not a big economy and its size is comparable to metropolitan Miami is false. Greece has a significantly larger economy than metropolitan Miami. According to the World Bank data, Greece's nominal GDP was approximately $258 billion in 2021. In contrast, the metropolitan area of Miami, which includes parts of Florida, has an estimated GDP of around $437 billion for the entire metropolitan area, but not just the city itself. Therefore, Greece's economy is notably smaller than even the metropolitan area of Miami.

Answer: [0]"
699,"Explanation: This claim is a simplification of the federal budget and debt situation, but it does not provide enough context to be accurate. The federal government's spending and borrowing are complex and involve various factors such as revenue sources, spending categories, and the overall national debt. The statement ""forty cents of every dollar"" being borrowed implies a specific and fixed percentage of the total federal budget, which is not a standard or commonly reported metric. The actual amount borrowed each year is a function of the difference between annual revenues and expenditures, and it can vary significantly from year to year.

Answer: [0]"
700,"Explanation: The claim that cigarette butts poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them is partially true but requires some context. Nicotine, a highly toxic alkaloid found in tobacco, can indeed be harmful if ingested in large quantities. However, the risk of poisoning from cigarette butts is generally low for babies and small children due to several factors:

1. **Dilution**: Nicotine in cigarette butts is diluted by the surrounding environment and the material of the butt itself, reducing its concentration.
2. **Physical Size**: Cigarette butts are relatively large compared to the size of a child's mouth, making it less likely for a child to ingest enough to cause significant harm.
3. **Behavioral Factors**: Children are unlikely to intentionally consume cigarette butts, and parents or caregivers typically take steps to keep such items out of reach.

While there have been cases where children have ingested cigarette butts and experienced adverse effects, these incidents are rare and usually involve other contributing factors or pre-existing conditions. Therefore, while the claim has a basis in fact, it is not universally true without additional context.

Answer: [0]"
701,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific job creation numbers for Georgia from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or other official economic reports. Without access to such data, it's impossible to confirm the exact number of jobs created since a particular individual took office. However, if we assume that these figures are accurate and come from a credible source, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [1] (assuming the numbers provided are accurate and from a credible source)"
702,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama was proposing pinprick strikes for military intervention in Syria is false. During his presidency, Obama did not propose pinprick strikes as a primary strategy for military intervention in Syria. Instead, he initially advocated for a limited military response to the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, which included the authorization of military strikes against Syria in 2013 after the Ghouta chemical attack. Pinprick strikes were not a significant part of the U.S. strategy during Obama's tenure.

Answer: [0]"
703,"Explanation: The claim that there are no political prisoners in Cuba is false. Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented cases of individuals imprisoned for their political beliefs or activities in Cuba. These reports often highlight cases where people have been detained, charged, or sentenced for peaceful political expression, which is a violation of their human rights.

Answer: [0]"
704,"Explanation: The claim suggests a contradiction in statements made by someone regarding the presence of residual forces in Iraq. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of the statements. If the person initially stated they would leave residual forces but later said they would not, then the claim is true. However, without specific dates, sources, or the exact statements from the individual in question, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim definitively.

Answer: [0]"
705,"Explanation: The claim states that when Sen. Edwards ran in 2004, he was not in favor of universal health care, and the speaker is glad he changed his stance later. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Sen. Edwards' positions during his 2004 campaign and compare them to his views later on.

In 2004, John Edwards, who was running for the Democratic nomination for president, did not explicitly advocate for a universal health care system. However, he supported expanding access to health care through various means such as increasing funding for Medicaid and Medicare, improving access to preventive care, and supporting community health centers. His platform focused more on expanding existing programs rather than implementing a universal health care system.

Later in his career, particularly after becoming a senator and then a presidential candidate again in 2008, Edwards became a strong advocate for a universal health care system. He supported the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was passed in 2010 under President Obama, and campaigned for its passage.

Given this information, the claim is partially accurate but also misleading. It correctly notes that in 2004, Edwards did not explicitly support a universal health care system, but it oversimplifies his position by implying he was against it entirely. It also implies a change in his stance without acknowledging that his views evolved over time.

Answer: [1]"
706,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the weekly operating hours of Multnomah County libraries with those of other libraries in the four-county region (which typically includes Clackamas, Columbia, Washington, and perhaps another county depending on the context). The claim states that Multnomah County libraries are open 44 hours per week, which is the lowest among the libraries in the region. However, without specific data on the operating hours of libraries in each county, it's impossible to verify this claim accurately. If we had such data, we could compare the hours and determine if the claim is accurate.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information about the operating hours of libraries in the four-county region. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
707,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Mike Huckabee appeared in diabetes infomercials for products that have not been supported by any health agencies. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether there is evidence of such appearances and whether the products were indeed unsupported by health agencies.

Mike Huckabee has been known to endorse various health-related products, including those related to diabetes management. However, it's important to note that many such endorsements are made without the backing of health agencies like the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) or CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), which often require rigorous testing and approval before endorsing medical claims. 

Several instances exist where celebrities, including Mike Huckabee, have endorsed products that later faced scrutiny or were found to be ineffective or misleading. For example, in 2015, Mike Huckabee was criticized for promoting a product called ""Diabetes Cure"" which was later found to be ineffective and potentially harmful. This aligns with the claim that such products were not supported by health agencies.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be true based on the historical context of Mike Huckabee's endorsements and the subsequent scrutiny of the products he promoted. While specific infomercials may not be documented, the pattern of behavior and the nature of the products he endorsed support the claim."
708,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a specific assertion about the potential impact of EPA regulations on certain agricultural sectors in Texas. However, without a credible source or data supporting this exact number, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. The EPA does regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, but the specific numbers provided for dairy facilities, swine operations, corn farms, and beef cattle operations do not align with publicly available data or reports from the EPA or other reliable sources.

Answer: [0]"
709,"Explanation: The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) is a proposed federal law in the United States that aims to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It does not discriminate against any religious group or individual's right to religious freedom. In fact, ENDA includes provisions to protect religious liberty, ensuring that religious organizations can continue to hire individuals who share their faith. Therefore, the claim that ENDA discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom is false.

Answer: [0]"
710,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Sen. McCain originally voted against the Bush tax cuts but now supports making them permanent. To evaluate this, we need to look at historical records of Sen. McCain's voting record on the Bush tax cuts. According to historical data, John McCain did indeed vote against the Bush tax cuts when they were first proposed in 2001 and 2003. However, later in his career, he did support extending these tax cuts. This aligns with the statement that he now believes they should be made permanent.

Answer: 1

The claim is accurate as it correctly identifies Sen. McCain's change in stance from opposing the original Bush tax cuts to supporting their permanence."
711,"Explanation: The claim that the mosquito population in South Florida is larger than it is in many other communities in the country can be evaluated by considering several factors. South Florida, particularly areas like Miami and the Everglades, have a warm and humid climate which is ideal for mosquito breeding. Additionally, the presence of wetlands and standing water contribute to higher mosquito populations. However, comparing the mosquito population across different regions requires specific data on mosquito counts, which can vary significantly depending on local environmental conditions, control measures, and species composition.

While it is plausible that certain areas in South Florida might have larger mosquito populations due to favorable conditions, without specific data comparing the mosquito populations in South Florida with those in other parts of the country, we cannot definitively state that the claim is universally true for all communities in the country.

Answer: [0]"
712,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the credibility of the sources, the methodology used to measure the impact of the investment, and any potential confounding variables that could have influenced the crime rate changes.

The claim states that when the City and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, crime went down 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years. However, without specific data from reliable sources such as police reports or crime statistics, it's difficult to verify the exact percentage decrease in crime. Additionally, other factors such as changes in law enforcement practices, community programs, or economic conditions could also contribute to the reduction in crime rates. Without controlling for these variables, it's not possible to attribute the entire change in crime rates solely to the park investment.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true based on the information provided, and there may be other contributing factors to the observed change in crime rates."
713,"Explanation: The claim is somewhat vague as it does not specify which gun laws are being referred to. However, based on commonly referenced gun control measures such as background checks, waiting periods, and restrictions on certain types of firearms, Rhode Island does indeed have some of the most stringent gun control laws in the United States. For example, Rhode Island requires universal background checks for all firearm sales, including private sales at gun shows, and has a ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines. These measures contribute to its ranking among the states with the strictest gun laws.

Answer: 1"
714,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the region in question regarding precipitation levels, water availability, and agricultural impacts for the year 2011 compared to historical records. Without such detailed information, it's impossible to confirm whether 2011 was indeed the worst drought year ever recorded in that particular region.

715,"Explanation: This claim is not universally true and depends on the specific context and data being referenced. Generally, economic data from the 1980s shows that income inequality increased, with wealthier individuals often experiencing greater gains than lower-income individuals. However, there were also periods and regions where lower-income groups saw significant improvements. Without a specific dataset or context, it's difficult to definitively state that the lowest income people had the biggest gains across all situations in the 1980s.

Answer: [0]"
716,"Explanation: This claim is false. The assertion that for every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps is not supported by factual data. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other economic reports, the number of people on food stamps (now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) did not increase at a rate that would support such a claim. In fact, during the Obama administration, the number of jobs increased significantly, and the number of people on SNAP also increased, but not in the ratio suggested by the claim. Additionally, various studies and analyses have shown that while SNAP enrollment did rise during this period, it was due to factors such as economic conditions rather than a direct correlation with job creation.

Answer: [0]"
717,"Explanation: The claim suggests that an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side could provide enough solar energy to meet the entire annual electricity demand of the United States. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Solar Energy Potential**: The amount of solar energy available depends on the efficiency of solar panels, the average sunlight hours in the Southwestern desert, and the total area of solar panels that could be installed.

2. **Current U.S. Electricity Demand**: The U.S. consumes approximately 4 trillion kilowatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year.

3. **Solar Panel Efficiency and Area**: Modern solar panels have an efficiency rate of around 20-25%. For simplicity, let's assume an average efficiency of 20%.

4. **Sunlight Hours**: The Southwestern deserts receive about 6-7 peak sun hours per day on average.

Given these factors, we can estimate the potential solar energy output. An area of 100 miles by 100 miles is roughly 640 square miles. Assuming each square mile can accommodate solar panels covering 10% of its surface area (which is a conservative estimate), we get 64 square miles of solar panels. With an efficiency of 20%, the effective area is 12.8 square miles.

If each square mile of solar panel can generate approximately 1 gigawatt (GW) of power under ideal conditions, then 12.8 square miles would generate about 12.8 GW of power. Over a year, with 6-7 peak sun hours per day, this translates to about 22,080 GWh or 22.08 TWh of electricity annually.

This is significantly less than the 4 trillion kWh needed to meet the U.S. electricity demand. Therefore, even with highly efficient solar panels and optimal sunlight conditions, an area of 100 miles by 100 miles would not be sufficient to meet the entire annual electricity needs of the United States.

718,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Bernie Sanders supported same-sex marriage 20 years ago when it was not popular. However, Bernie Sanders did not publicly support same-sex marriage until 2013, which was more than 20 years after the Stonewall riots (1969) and a significant period after the modern gay rights movement gained momentum. His support for same-sex marriage was part of a broader shift in American political discourse on LGBTQ+ rights, but it did not align with the claim of being ""there"" when it was unpopular.

719,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no evidence that the administration has issued rules for $1 abortions in ObamaCare, nor does it require all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay an abortion premium. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as ObamaCare, requires most health insurance plans to cover essential health benefits, including most forms of abortion services, but it does not mandate a specific fee or premium for these services. The cost of abortion services under ACA-compliant plans is typically covered by the plan itself, and patients do not need to pay an additional premium for this coverage.

720,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Perry has never held a private-sector job is false. Rick Perry, who served as the Governor of Texas from 2000 to 2015, worked for several private companies before entering politics. He was a partner at the law firm McKool Smith from 1986 to 1994 and later served as the president of the Texas Railroad Commission from 1994 to 1998, which is a state agency but often considered part of the private sector due to its regulatory role.

Answer: [0]"
721,"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs state taxpayers over $3 billion every year is difficult to verify without a specific source or context, as the cost of illegal immigration can vary widely depending on the methodology used to estimate these costs. Studies and reports often cite different figures and factors such as healthcare, education, and law enforcement. For instance, a report from the Center for Immigration Studies might present one figure, while a study by the Migration Policy Institute could present another. Without a clear reference to a specific study or data set, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0"
722,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and statements from reputable sources regarding endorsements during the 2016 U.S. House of Representatives election in Virginia's 7th district. Dave Brat, who was a professor at Liberty University, ran against Eric Cantor for the Republican nomination and later against Thelma Drake in the general election. The claim suggests that a liberal immigration reform group endorsed his opponent. However, there is no widely known or documented instance of a prominent liberal immigration reform group endorsing either of these candidates. In fact, most such groups tend to support more progressive candidates and policies. Without specific evidence of such an endorsement, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
723,"Explanation: The claim that ""welders make more money than philosophers"" is too broad and general to be universally true. Salary varies widely depending on location, experience, and specific job roles within each profession. In many cases, philosophers may earn salaries comparable to or even higher than welders, especially in academic or research positions. Additionally, factors such as industry demand, economic conditions, and individual performance play significant roles in determining earnings.

Answer: [0]"
724,"Explanation: The claim that Teddy Roosevelt first called for health care reform nearly a century ago is false. While Theodore Roosevelt did advocate for some social reforms, including limited healthcare measures as part of his ""New Nationalism"" platform during his 1912 presidential campaign, he did not call for comprehensive health care reform as we understand it today. Comprehensive health care reform as we know it today involves more extensive coverage and regulation than what was proposed by Roosevelt at that time.

Answer: [0]"
725,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on fundraising for U.S. Senate races in Florida. According to available records, Charlie Crist's fundraising efforts during his 2010 U.S. Senate campaign were not the highest in terms of total amount raised. The highest fundraising record for a U.S. Senate race in Florida was set by Bill Nelson in 2012, who raised over $85 million. Charlie Crist's campaign raised approximately $67 million, which was significant but not the highest.

726,"Explanation: The claim ""The American people spoke pretty loudly. They said stop all the looming tax hikes"" is a subjective statement that reflects a particular interpretation of public sentiment rather than a verifiable fact. It suggests that there was a significant public outcry against potential tax increases, but it does not provide specific evidence such as polling data, survey results, or statements from credible organizations representing public opinion.

This claim cannot be definitively verified without additional context or supporting evidence, making it impossible to confirm its accuracy based solely on the given statement."
727,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific search data from Google for the exact time period mentioned. Google does not publicly release detailed real-time search data for individual users or events without a specific request for research purposes. However, if such data were available and showed that Debra Medina was indeed the top search query immediately after the debate on January 14th, and then ranked third later in the evening, the claim could be considered true. Without access to the actual search data for that specific date and time, it's impossible to confirm or deny the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
731,"Explanation: The claim states that after four years of a celebrity president, 85% of recent college graduates are moving back in with their parents. This statement is highly unlikely to be accurate for several reasons:

1. **Lack of Reliable Data**: There is no widely recognized or credible source that supports such a specific statistic regarding the percentage of recent college graduates moving back in with their parents after a celebrity president's term.

2. **Correlation vs. Causation**: Even if there were data suggesting an increase in young adults moving back in with their parents, it would be difficult to attribute this trend specifically to a celebrity president without further evidence linking the two events.

3. **General Trends**: While it is known that some young adults do move back in with their parents due to economic factors such as job market conditions, housing costs, and personal choices, attributing this trend to a single factor like a celebrity presidency is not supported by available data.

Answer: [0]"
733,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there have been ""hundreds"" of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the U.S. tax code since 1986, which was the last major overhaul of the tax code. While it is true that the Internal Revenue Code has undergone numerous changes over the years, the specific assertion of ""hundreds"" of new preferences and loopholes is difficult to verify without a precise count. However, significant tax reform acts such as the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 have introduced substantial changes to the tax code. Additionally, the IRS regularly updates the tax code with new interpretations and clarifications through regulations and court decisions.

Given the complexity and frequent updates to the tax code, it is plausible that hundreds of new provisions have been added since 1986. However, without a definitive count, we cannot confirm the exact number of new preferences and loopholes.

Answer: [1]"
734,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider Suzanne Bonamici's stance on Medicare funding. Suzanne Bonamici is a Democrat who has historically supported Medicare and other social safety net programs. The claim suggests she supports a $500 billion cut to Medicare, which would be contrary to her party affiliation and past voting record. There is no credible evidence to suggest that she voted for such a significant cut to Medicare. In fact, she is known for advocating for healthcare reform and supporting Medicare.

Answer: [0]"
735,"Explanation: The claim is false. In 2004, the Republican candidate George W. Bush won the presidency, and his party also controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This occurred more recently than 1928, making 1928 not the last time Republicans held all three branches of government.

Answer: [0]"
736,"Explanation: This claim is false. While both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have supported tax policies that include raising taxes on higher income brackets, there is no evidence to suggest they want to raise taxes on all income brackets. In fact, their tax plans often include provisions for middle-class tax relief or tax cuts. For example, during his presidency, Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which included tax cuts for middle-class Americans, and Hillary Clinton has proposed plans that include a ""wealth tax"" on the ultra-wealthy while also proposing some tax cuts for middle-income earners.

Answer: [0]"
737,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Saxby Chambliss's voting record and compare his alignment with both Democrats and conservatives. Saxby Chambliss served as a Republican Senator from Georgia from 2005 to 2017. Historically, Republican senators tend to align more closely with conservative viewpoints and less with Democratic ones. Additionally, Chambliss was a member of the Republican Party, which typically aligns with conservative policies rather than liberal or Democratic ones.

Given that Chambliss was a Republican and a member of the conservative wing of the party, it is unlikely that he would vote more frequently with Democrats than with conservatives. In fact, his voting record would likely show a strong alignment with Republican and conservative positions.

738,"Explanation: The claim states that for the second consecutive quarter, the campaign has raised more money than any other challenger in the nation and has reached a total fundraising amount of over $800,000. To verify this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as financial reports, campaign finance records, or official statements from the campaign itself or relevant authorities. Without access to such verifiable data, it's impossible to confirm the accuracy of these claims.

Answer: 0"
739,"Explanation: The claim refers to a specific group of workers, ""ground zero workers,"" who were likely involved in the cleanup and recovery efforts following a significant event such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City. These workers faced significant health risks due to exposure to hazardous materials. The statement suggests that these workers waited for the current administration to take action to address their health issues, which implies a period of inaction from previous administrations.

However, the claim is vague and does not specify which administration it refers to or when exactly the workers stood by and waited for action. Additionally, it is unclear whether the claim is referring to a specific historical event or a more general situation. Without more context, it's difficult to verify the exact timeline and actions taken by different administrations regarding these workers' health concerns.

Answer: 0

The claim is too vague and lacks specific details to be verified as true or false without additional context and evidence. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true based on the information provided."
740,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records of naval deployments and the capabilities of various navies around the world. While it's important to note that the number of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers has increased over time, there is no widely recognized or documented instance where five such carriers have been docked together simultaneously during peacetime operations since World War II. The U.S. Navy, which operates the majority of the world's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, does not publicly disclose specific docking configurations for operational security reasons. However, given the significant logistical challenges and the fact that such a large concentration of powerful assets would likely be a matter of public record, it is highly unlikely that this has occurred without any prior mention.

741,"Explanation: The claim states that at 50 Milwaukee schools serving at least 80% African-American and at least 80% low-income students, the reading proficiency is 8%. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable educational sources for these particular schools. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, reading proficiency rates can vary significantly depending on various factors including school resources, teaching quality, and individual student circumstances. Therefore, without concrete evidence supporting this specific statistic, the claim cannot be confirmed as true.

742,"Explanation: The claim is false because it misrepresents the healthcare reform policies that were being discussed during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Barack Obama, as a candidate, proposed a healthcare reform bill that included a mandate for individuals to have health insurance, but it did not include fines for small businesses. Small businesses were given certain exemptions and incentives under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was passed after Obama became president. The ACA provided tax credits to small businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees to help them offer health insurance to their workers.

Without specific data from a reliable source such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or other economic reports, it's not possible to confirm or deny this claim definitively. The claim could be true if Wisconsin's job growth is the lowest among the Midwest states, but without current and accurate data, we cannot make a judgment.

744,"Explanation: The claim that ""Under the Baucus bill, federal funds would subsidize coverage of elective abortions"" is false. The Baucus bill, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was later amended into the Affordable Care Act (ACA), specifically prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion services, with exceptions for cases of life endangerment, rape, and incest. The ACA explicitly states that no federal funds may be used for abortion except to save the life of the mother, or in cases of rape, incest, or if the pregnancy results from sexual assault.

745,"Explanation: The claim that ""cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans"" is not supported by available data. Public opinion polls and surveys have shown mixed results, but generally indicate that while some people may be unfamiliar with cap-and-trade, it does not have a strong negative sentiment among the public. In fact, support for market-based solutions like cap-and-trade has been relatively stable or even increasing in recent years, especially when framed as a way to address climate change.

746,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent voter registration data from Florida. According to the most recent data available, as of 2023, approximately 24% of Florida voters are registered as independents. This percentage has been relatively stable over the past few years. Therefore, the claim that fewer than 20 percent of Florida voters are Independents is not accurate.

747,"Explanation: The Common Core State Standards were developed by a consortium of governors and state education commissioners, along with input from teachers, school administrators, and experts in curriculum and assessment. While teachers may not have been directly involved in the writing process, they provided feedback and input during the development phase. Additionally, the standards were designed to ensure that students across different states would be learning similar material at each grade level, which was intended to improve educational quality and prepare students for college and careers.

Answer: 0"
748,"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""parent trigger"" legislation refers to a set of laws that allow parents to petition for school reform if their child's school is underperforming. These laws were not drafted by either President Obama's or President Clinton's top advisers. Instead, they were developed by local and state-level education reformers, community groups, and sometimes with input from various stakeholders including parents, teachers, and school administrators. The term ""parent trigger"" gained prominence during the Obama administration but was not a product of his administration's drafting process.

Answer: [0]"
749,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the current amount of oil imported with the amount imported when Senator McCain took office. Senator John McCain took office in January 1987. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States imported approximately 6.5 million barrels of oil per day in 1987. In 2023, the latest available data shows that the United States imported around 20 million barrels of oil per day. This means the current daily imports are about three times higher than they were when McCain took office.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because the current daily imports of oil are indeed about triple what they were when Senator McCain took office in 1987."
750,"Explanation: The claim that four-year terms for City Council members are the norm in most cities of a certain size is difficult to verify without specific data on the term lengths of City Council members across various cities. Term lengths can vary widely depending on local governance structures, state laws, and historical practices. Some cities may have longer or shorter terms, and the ""norm"" could differ significantly between regions or even within the same region.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be universally verified as true without comprehensive data on term lengths across multiple cities of similar sizes. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that four-year terms are the norm in most cities of a given size."
751,"Explanation: The claim states that Tommy Thompson, as the former Governor of Wisconsin, was the father of welfare reform and created the Wisconsin Works (WWorks) program, which served as a model for national and international reforms. While it is accurate that Tommy Thompson implemented WWorks during his tenure as governor, the claim exaggerates his role by suggesting he ""created"" welfare reform. Welfare reform has a long history and various iterations across different states and countries before WWorks. Additionally, while WWorks did serve as a model for other states and some international programs, attributing its success solely to Thompson oversimplifies the complex nature of policy development and implementation.

Answer: 0"
752,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the volume of American-made products sold internationally over time. Without access to such comprehensive trade statistics that cover a long period, it's challenging to definitively state whether current sales of American-made products to other countries are higher than at any point in history. The claim could be true if recent trade data shows an increase in exports of American goods compared to historical data, but without such data, we cannot confirm the statement.

Answer: [0]"
753,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the specific state being referred to and the sources of data for healthcare costs related to cancer and its affiliated issues. Without specifying which state and without access to up-to-date and reliable health expenditure data, it's challenging to verify the exact figure. However, according to the American Cancer Society, the estimated cost of cancer care in the United States was approximately $156 billion in 2020, which includes direct medical expenses and lost productivity. This figure would be distributed across all states, not just one.

Given that the claim specifies a cost of over $20 billion for a single state, and considering the national figures, it seems plausible but not necessarily accurate without more specific data. For instance, if the state in question has a relatively small population compared to the national average, the cost might indeed be around $20 billion or less.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and thus, it is likely false unless specific data supporting the claim for that particular state is provided."
754,"Explanation: The claim ""On a cap-and-trade plan"" is incomplete and does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. A cap-and-trade plan is a regulatory program that sets a limit (cap) on emissions or pollutants and allows entities to buy and sell allowances (trade) to meet those limits. However, without a specific statement or assertion about a particular aspect of a cap-and-trade plan, it cannot be judged as true or false.

756,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011 is false. While President Obama did take steps to address the issue of prescription drug costs, including signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) into law, which aimed to increase transparency in drug pricing and improve access to generic drugs, there is no specific evidence or data supporting the claim that he directly reduced the cost of prescription drugs for 3.6 million Americans in 2011. The PPACA was signed into law in 2010, and its full effects were not immediately realized.

Answer: [0]"
757,"Explanation: The claim is false. Ted Cruz, as a conservative Republican politician, has historically opposed illegal immigration and does not support the legalization of individuals who entered the country illegally. His stance aligns with traditional Republican views on border security and immigration reform, which typically advocate for a path to citizenship through legal means rather than immediate legalization without conditions.

Answer: [0]"
758,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific context, such as who ""he"" is and what provision is being referred to. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement. However, if we assume the claim refers to a specific individual (like a former executive at AIG) and a specific provision related to bonuses, the claim could be evaluated based on historical records and legal documents.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is given under the assumption that without more context, the claim cannot be verified as true or false. If additional context were provided, the answer could potentially change.)"
759,"Explanation: The claim ""Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4"" refers to the number of countries that were bombed during the presidencies of Barack Obama and George W. Bush. However, this claim is not accurate. 

During George W. Bush's presidency (2001-2009), the United States conducted military operations in Afghanistan (2001), Iraq (2003), and Libya (2011) which involved significant bombing campaigns. The total number of countries where the U.S. conducted significant bombing operations under Bush was more than four.

During Barack Obama's presidency (2009-2017), the U.S. conducted significant bombing campaigns in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, among others. The exact count is complex due to the nature of targeted strikes and drone operations, but it is certainly more than seven.

Therefore, the claim is false as it misrepresents the number of countries where the U.S. conducted significant bombing operations during each presidency.

Answer: [0]"
760,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical events and political statements made by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Debbie Wasserman Schultz served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida from 2007 to 2019. During her tenure, she was known for her strong support of the Democratic Party and criticism of Republican policies. However, there is no credible evidence or record of her blaming Republicans for the creation of Hamas. Hamas is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist organization that was founded in 1987 during the first intifada, long before Wasserman Schultz entered politics. The organization's origins and ideology predate any significant political influence she might have had.

Answer: [0]"
761,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Hillsborough's Public Transportation Commission has a rule requiring cabbies to wear socks. This statement is likely false because there is no known regulation or policy by any public transportation commission mandating that taxi drivers or cabbies must wear socks. Taxi regulations typically focus on safety, hygiene, and customer service standards rather than specific clothing requirements like footwear or sock-wearing.

Answer: [0]"
762,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but also misleading. As of the latest updates, Virginia has not yet explored for or produced oil and natural gas offshore. In 2020, the U.S. Department of the Interior approved a plan to allow for offshore drilling off the coast of Virginia, but no production has started yet. Additionally, the claim mentions that Virginia would be the first state on the East Coast to engage in these activities, which is accurate as other East Coast states like New Jersey and Maryland have also been considering similar plans but none have been implemented.

Answer: [0]"
763,"Explanation: This claim is comparing the political positions of the McCain campaign to that of Vice President Al Gore's position one week before the 2000 presidential election. John McCain ran for president in 2008, not in 2000. Additionally, Al Gore was running against President George W. Bush in the 2000 election, while McCain was running against Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2008. Therefore, the claim is comparing apples to oranges as it mixes up different election cycles and candidates.

Answer: [0]"
764,"Explanation: This claim is overly generalized and does not provide specific evidence or context to support its broad statements. Health care reform measures can have various impacts depending on the specific policies implemented. Some reforms might indeed increase costs and taxes while potentially improving access to care and overall quality, whereas others might aim to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Without a detailed analysis of specific reforms and their outcomes, it is not accurate to state that ""everything"" about health care reform will raise costs, raise taxes, and lower the quality of health care.

Answer: [0]"
765,"Explanation: The claim that ""Since 1965, the United States has spent untold trillions yet the poverty rate hasn't budged"" is a simplification of a complex issue. While it is true that the U.S. government has spent significant amounts of money on anti-poverty programs since the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act in 1964 (which was part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's ""War on Poverty""), the poverty rate has not remained constant. The poverty rate has fluctuated over the years and has been influenced by various factors including economic conditions, changes in the definition of poverty, and the effectiveness of different policies.

According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate in 1965 was around 19%, and it has varied between 11% and 17% over the subsequent decades. For instance, the poverty rate dropped to about 11% in 2000 but has since fluctuated, reaching a high of 15.1% in 2010 during the Great Recession and dropping to 10.5% in 2019 before rising again due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The claim is misleading because it does not account for these fluctuations and the various factors affecting the poverty rate. Additionally, the term ""untold trillions"" is vague and could be interpreted as an exaggeration without specific context.

Answer: [0]"
766,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data on state spending on higher education from the beginning of the decade to the present day for all U.S. states. According to available data from sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics and various state budget reports, multiple states have reduced their spending on higher education since the start of the decade. For example, states like Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana have seen decreases in funding for higher education. Therefore, New Jersey is not unique in spending less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade.

Answer: 0"
767,"Explanation: The claim states that a million people a year enter the U.S. legally, and no other country comes close to this number. According to data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, approximately 1.1 million individuals were granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States in fiscal year 2021. However, this does not necessarily mean that exactly one million people enter the U.S. legally each year, as it includes both new arrivals and adjustments to status for those already in the country. Additionally, while the U.S. does attract a large number of immigrants, countries like Canada, Australia, and Germany also have significant immigration numbers, though they may not reach the exact one million mark annually.

Answer: 0"
768,"Explanation: The claim is false. During the George W. Bush presidency, which was when the Republicans were in charge, the government did not expand health care through a prescription drug program. Instead, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, signed into law by President Bush, expanded the Medicare program to include prescription drug coverage for the first time. This act was a significant expansion of the federal government's role in providing health insurance, but it was not a general expansion of government health care.

Answer: 0"
770,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check two parts: the unemployment rate when Congressman Steve Cohen took office in 2007 and the current unemployment rate in Shelby County.

1. **Unemployment Rate in 2007**: According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the national unemployment rate in December 2006 (the closest month to when Steve Cohen took office in January 2007) was 4.7%. This aligns with the claim stating it was 4.8% when he took office.

2. **Current Unemployment Rate in Shelby County**: As of the latest available data, the unemployment rate in Shelby County, Tennessee, varies depending on the source. However, a recent report from the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development shows the unemployment rate for Shelby County as of the most recent quarter was around 9.7%, which matches the claim.

Given these points, both parts of the claim appear to be accurate according to the available data.

Answer: [1]"
771,"Explanation: The claim that the Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country is false. While the Koch brothers, through their various organizations such as the Koch Industries and the Koch Political Action Committee, have been involved in funding conservative political causes and opposing environmental regulations, they are not typically considered among the largest direct sources of pollution. The term ""biggest polluters"" usually refers to industries or companies that emit the most pollutants into the environment, such as coal-fired power plants, oil refineries, and other industrial facilities. The Kochs' influence has been more about policy advocacy and funding than direct pollution.

Answer: [0]"
772,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Texas does exempt jet fuel from its state motor fuels tax, several other states also have similar exemptions for jet fuel. For example, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina also do not tax jet fuel. Additionally, the federal government already taxes jet fuel, so these state-level exemptions do not result in double taxation.

773,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the rates of tobacco use during pregnancy in Coos County compared to the rates in Oregon and the United States as a whole. The claim states that a baby in Coos County is twice as likely to be born to a mother who used tobacco during her pregnancy compared to the average baby born in Oregon or the U.S. Without access to reliable and recent statistics that directly compare these rates, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement.

774,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the funding levels for each school system over the past six years from the county government's perspective. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm or deny whether there has been an increase in funding. The claim could be true if the funding remained constant or decreased, but it could also be false if the funding increased during that period. Since no supporting evidence or data is provided, the claim cannot be verified as true or false.

778,"Explanation: The claim appears to be partially accurate but misleading. In Colorado, there is a provision that allows voters to download and print their ballots at home, which is part of the state's mail-in voting process. However, the claim about ""ballot collectors"" turning in these printed ballots is not accurate. Under Colorado law, voters must return their completed ballots directly to election officials through designated methods such as mail, drop boxes, or in-person at certain locations. Ballot collectors are not officially recognized in Colorado's election laws for returning completed ballots; they can assist with requesting and delivering ballots but not with returning completed ones.

779,"Explanation: The claim that ""During the Eisenhower Administration, not a single soldier died in combat"" is false. Dwight D. Eisenhower served as the President of the United States from January 20, 1953, to January 20, 1961. During his presidency, there were several military conflicts and operations where American soldiers died in combat. For instance, during the Korean War, which was ongoing throughout much of Eisenhower's term, thousands of U.S. soldiers lost their lives. Additionally, there were other military engagements and operations during this period that involved casualties.

781,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if there is any credible evidence that California Senator Dianne Feinstein made such a statement. After reviewing available sources, there is no record of Dianne Feinstein making a statement along these lines. The phrase ""Give me your guns, I'm rounding them up"" is often attributed to former President Joe Biden during his campaign, but not to Dianne Feinstein.

782,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has supported George Bush more than I have Barack Obama"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it impossible to verify its truthfulness without additional information. Without knowing who ""he"" and ""I"" refer to, or what specific actions or periods of support are being compared, we cannot determine if the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
783,"Explanation: The claim suggests that by 2015, the United States would be paying for the entire People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China through interest payments. This is highly unlikely for several reasons:

1. **Interest Payments**: Interest payments are typically made on loans or debts. There is no historical or current evidence of the U.S. owing significant debts to China that would necessitate such a payment.

2. **Military Spending**: The PLA is funded through the Chinese government budget, not through external debt or interest payments from other countries. China does not rely on foreign interest payments to fund its military.

3. **Economic Relations**: While there are significant economic relations between the U.S. and China, including trade and investment, these do not involve the kind of direct financial obligations described in the claim.

4. **Political Context**: Such a scenario would be unprecedented and would likely have been widely reported if it were true.

Given these points, the claim is not supported by factual evidence or historical precedent.

Answer: [0]"
784,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Budget Control Act was not a budget but rather a law that was passed in 2011 to reduce the federal deficit by setting caps on federal spending and establishing a process for raising the debt ceiling. It was part of a series of measures aimed at reducing the national debt, not a regular budget bill.

785,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence or data showing that Medicare officials have indeed treated Humana and AARP differently regarding their communication with seniors. Without such evidence, it is not possible to confirm or deny the claim definitively. The claim could be true if there is documented proof of inconsistent treatment, but without such proof, we cannot assert the claim as true.

786,"Explanation: There have been no reports or verified information about the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) building a hotel in Syria. The Islamic State was primarily known for its control over territories in Iraq and Syria, where it established governance and infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and administrative buildings, but not hotels. Additionally, the group's focus was more on military operations, propaganda, and establishing a caliphate rather than constructing tourist accommodations.

Answer: [0]"
787,"Explanation: The claim is somewhat vague and lacks specific context, but it appears to refer to a situation where there might be a discrepancy between the understanding of a deal by different parties involved, specifically Iran and other negotiating parties. This kind of statement could be made in various international negotiations where misunderstandings or misinterpretations occur. Without more specific details about which deal is being referred to and from what context, it's difficult to definitively verify the truth of the claim. However, given the general nature of the statement and the possibility of such situations occurring in international diplomacy, we can assume it is plausible.

788,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has 77 different means-tested social welfare programs is false. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, as of the latest available data, there are approximately 82 means-tested federal assistance programs. This count includes both cash and non-cash benefits. The number can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific criteria used to define a program as ""means-tested,"" but it is consistently around 80-85 programs.

Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0

Note: If more context were provided about who made the statement and in what context, we could potentially evaluate the claim more accurately."
790,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at reliable sources that track immigration detention trends over time. According to data from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and reports from organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the number of immigrants detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has indeed increased significantly over the past decade. In 2006, ICE reported detaining approximately 70,000 individuals per year. By 2019, this number had risen to around 438,000 individuals. This trend continued to grow in subsequent years, with the number of annual detentions reaching over 500,000 in recent years.

Without specific details or a reliable source confirming this transaction, it's not possible to definitively state the truth of this claim. However, given the nature of the claim and the fact that Jimmy Dimora was involved in corruption, it is plausible that such an incident could have occurred, but without concrete evidence, we cannot confirm it.

792,"Explanation: The claim that the approval rating of Congress is down to 13 percent could be true or false depending on the specific time period and data source being referenced. Approval ratings for Congress can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as economic conditions, political events, and public sentiment. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need to check a reliable, up-to-date source of polling data.

Answer: 0

(Note: Without a specific date or source to verify, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, based on the given information alone, the claim cannot be verified as true or false, but since the task requires choosing between 0 or 1, I am assuming the claim is likely false unless proven otherwise by credible sources.)"
793,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. There is no widespread or documented evidence suggesting that students in Oregon are skipping math classes to study the Bible. Such a significant shift in educational behavior would likely be reported by schools, educational authorities, or media outlets if it were occurring. Without any credible sources or data supporting this claim, it seems more plausible as a rumor or misunderstanding.

794,"Explanation: This claim is comparing the incarceration rates of African-Americans in the United States to those under apartheid in South Africa. According to various studies, including those from the Prison Policy Initiative and Human Rights Watch, the United States has had higher incarceration rates for African-Americans compared to their proportion of the population. For example, in 2016, African-Americans made up about 33% of the federal prison population but only about 13% of the U.S. population. In contrast, during the apartheid era in South Africa, the imprisonment rate for black South Africans was significantly lower than their proportion of the total population. Therefore, the claim that the United States currently incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did is accurate.

795,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the specific percentages for both English and math before 2005 and in 2013. According to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB), the data provided in the claim aligns with their reports. The THECB's data shows that in 2005, the percentage of Texas high school students meeting the college readiness standards was 28% in English and 42% in math. In 2013, these figures increased to 65% in English and 66% in math. This information is consistent across multiple reliable sources.

796,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has a well-deserved reputation for setting the gold standard for food safety is not universally true. While some states may have stringent food safety regulations, the reputation of Georgia specifically being at the top of food safety standards is not a widely recognized or supported fact. Food safety standards can vary significantly by state and are influenced by numerous factors including local laws, enforcement, and industry practices. Without specific data or a recognized benchmark indicating that Georgia outperforms other states in food safety, this claim cannot be substantiated as true.

Answer: [0]"
797,"Explanation: The claim that ""if lawmakers fail to avert the fiscal cliff, 18 percent of the federal money that is sent to the states will be eliminated"" is false. The fiscal cliff refers to a series of tax increases and spending cuts that were set to take effect in early 2013 unless Congress acted to change them. However, it does not specifically refer to a reduction in federal funds sent to states. In fact, the term ""fiscal cliff"" was used to describe the potential economic impact of these changes, not a specific cut in state funding. Additionally, any such cuts would likely be decided through separate legislation rather than automatically occurring due to the fiscal cliff.

Answer: [0]"
798,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the average annual compensation for teachers in the Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) system in 2011. According to available data from the Milwaukee Teachers' Education Association (MTEA) and other educational resources, the average salary for teachers in MPS was around $45,000 to $50,000 in 2011. This figure does not exceed $100,000.

799,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal eliminates Medicare in 10 years is false. Paul Ryan, during his tenure as a member of Congress, proposed several budget plans that aimed at reforming Medicare but did not propose its complete elimination. His plan generally sought to transform Medicare from a traditional entitlement program into a defined contribution program, where beneficiaries would receive a set amount of money to purchase health insurance. This was part of a broader plan to reduce the growth of federal spending over time. However, it did not eliminate Medicare entirely.

801,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence that Tom Hughes supports over-development and paving over large areas of land. Without a specific context or source for this claim, it's difficult to verify its accuracy. However, Tom Hughes is known as a conservationist and environmental advocate, often supporting efforts to protect natural habitats and reduce urban sprawl. Therefore, without concrete evidence or a reliable source supporting this claim, it cannot be confirmed as true.

Answer: [0]"
802,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at David Cicilline's stance on mandatory sentences for domestic violence and child abuse. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, has been a vocal advocate against harsh mandatory minimum sentences for domestic violence offenders. He has argued that such sentences do not address the root causes of domestic violence and can be harmful to victims. In 2019, he co-sponsored the ""Ending Domestic Violence Mandatory Minimums Act,"" which aimed to repeal mandatory minimum sentences for domestic violence offenses. This act aligns with his opposition to tough mandatory sentences for domestic violence cases.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because David Cicilline has indeed opposed tough mandatory sentences for those convicted of domestic violence, as evidenced by his support for legislation to repeal such sentences."
803,"Explanation: The claim ""Bill White offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants"" is vague without context, but it generally refers to providing protection or refuge to individuals who are not legally allowed to be in a country. However, without specific details about which Bill White (there have been multiple politicians with this name) and the context in which they made such an offer, it's difficult to verify the claim. If we consider a notable example, former Houston Mayor Bill White II did advocate for immigration reform and supported policies that could be interpreted as offering sanctuary to undocumented immigrants, but this would need to be confirmed with specific evidence.

Answer: [0]"
804,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican Party's stance on abortion, including the specific language regarding exceptions such as rape, has evolved over time. The current GOP platform does not explicitly state a blanket ban without exceptions but rather supports laws that allow states to set their own standards, which often include exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. Prior to the 1980s, the GOP platform did not have a consistent stance on abortion, and the modern language on abortion rights was not present in earlier platforms.

Answer: [0]"
805,"Explanation: The claim is false. The actual provisions of Arizona's SB 1070, which was enacted in 2010, allow law enforcement officers to inquire about a person's immigration status during a lawful stop if there is reasonable suspicion that the person has committed any violation of the immigration laws of the United States. This means that police do not need to observe something illegal before checking immigration status; they can do so if they have reasonable suspicion of any immigration violation.

Answer: [0]"
806,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as a verified source or investigation that confirms the identity of the individuals in the photo used by Fox News. Without such evidence, it is impossible to determine whether the claim is accurate.

Answer: [0]"
807,"Explanation: This claim is overly generalized and does not account for the complex economic factors that influence employment rates when the minimum wage is raised. Economic studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of minimum wage increases on unemployment. Some studies suggest that raising the minimum wage can lead to job losses in certain sectors, particularly among low-skilled workers, while others indicate that the effects are minimal or even positive, such as through increased consumer spending which can stimulate demand for labor.

808,"Explanation: The claim that ""Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law"" is a specific allegation that requires evidence from legal proceedings or official reports. Without referencing a specific case or source, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim. However, based on available public records and news reports, there have been instances where Trump properties and businesses faced discrimination charges. For example, in 2015, the New York Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) alleged that Trump Organization properties had engaged in discriminatory housing practices. While these allegations were related to the Trump Organization rather than specifically ""Trump Management,"" they do indicate that such charges have been made against entities associated with Donald Trump.

Answer: 1"
809,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the annual budget of the National Park Service with the annual budget of the city of Austin. According to recent data, the National Park Service had a fiscal year 2023 budget of approximately $3.5 billion. In contrast, the city of Austin's general fund budget for fiscal year 2022 was around $1.8 billion. Therefore, the National Park Service's budget is significantly larger than the city of Austin's.

Answer: 0"
810,"Explanation: The claim suggests an irony in First Energy Corp. having a name on a football stadium in Cleveland, while Cleveland Public Power supplies the electricity. However, there is no inherent contradiction or irony in this statement unless additional context is provided that would suggest otherwise. The fact that a company can sponsor a stadium and another company provides the electricity does not inherently create an ironic situation. Irony typically involves a contrast between expectations and reality, but without more context about the relationship between First Energy Corp. and Cleveland Public Power, or any specific expectations being contradicted, the claim does not present an obvious instance of irony.

Answer: [0]"
811,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of murders committed with various methods in 2011. The claim states that more people were murdered using knives, hands or feet, or clubs and hammers than with any type of rifle. To verify this, we would need reliable data from a reputable source such as the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports or another authoritative database on crime statistics.

Assuming we have access to such data, we would look at the total number of murders for each method in 2011. If the sum of murders committed with knives, hands or feet, or clubs and hammers exceeds the number of murders committed with rifles, then the claim would be true. Otherwise, it would be false.

Since I don't have access to real-time databases or specific statistical reports, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim without further research. However, based on general knowledge and common trends in crime statistics, it is plausible that such a claim could be true, especially considering the prevalence of personal weapons like knives and the use of improvised weapons in many regions.

Answer: [1]"
812,"Explanation: The claim that Tim Kaine, as governor, oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration is not supported by factual evidence. Tim Kaine served as the Governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2014. During his tenure, he focused on various policies including education, healthcare, and economic development. There is no widely recognized or documented data indicating a significant increase in illegal immigration under his governorship. Immigration trends are typically tracked by federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, and there is no public record suggesting that Virginia experienced a notable rise in illegal immigration during Kaine's time as governor.

Answer: [0]"
813,"Explanation: The claim that Virginia's ban on felons from voting is a Jim Crow-era law is false. While it is true that many states, including Virginia, implemented such bans during the Jim Crow era as part of efforts to disenfranchise African American voters, modern felon disenfranchisement laws in Virginia were not necessarily enacted with the same intent or during the same period. Virginia's current ban on voting by felons was established in 1902, which is after the peak of Jim Crow laws but still within the context of post-Reconstruction era restrictions on voting rights. Additionally, the specific implementation and enforcement of these laws have evolved over time, and the modern rationale for such bans often focuses on public safety and rehabilitation rather than racial discrimination.

Answer: [0]"
814,"Explanation: The claim ""Weve broken by millions the all-time record for votes in a GOP presidential primary election"" suggests that a significant number of votes were cast in a Republican primary election, surpassing any previous record by a large margin. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the relevant election results. Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether the statement is accurate. However, given the phrasing, it seems to imply a substantial increase in voter turnout, which would be noteworthy.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without specific evidence of the number of votes and comparison to previous records. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be false until proven otherwise."
815,"Explanation: The claim that only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teenagers or young people is likely false. According to various studies and labor market data, a significant portion of minimum wage workers are indeed teenagers and young adults. In many countries, teenagers often work part-time jobs at minimum wage during their summer breaks or after school hours. Additionally, younger individuals may enter the workforce at minimum wage as their first job before advancing to higher-paying positions.

Answer: [0]"
816,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Bernie Sanders' public statements and positions regarding immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers. Bernie Sanders has been a consistent advocate for gun control measures and has not supported immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers. In fact, he has often criticized such immunity provisions as part of larger gun reform legislation. There is no credible evidence to suggest that Bernie Sanders has reversed his position on this issue.

Answer: 0"
817,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent economic data from various states, particularly focusing on Wisconsin. While national economic recovery generally indicates improved economic conditions such as job growth and increased consumer spending, it does not necessarily translate to higher-than-expected tax revenues and budget surpluses in every state. Tax revenues and budget outcomes depend on a variety of factors including state-specific economic conditions, tax policies, and fiscal management. Without specific data showing that nearly every state, including Wisconsin, experienced higher-than-expected tax revenues and budget surpluses due to national economic recovery, we cannot confirm this claim.

Answer: 0"
818,"Explanation: The claim ""We are going to sell this house and use the proceeds to stabilize rates"" is vague and lacks context. To determine its truthfulness, we would need more information about what ""stabilize rates"" means in this context. Without additional details, it's impossible to verify if the statement is accurate.

Answer: 0"
819,"Explanation: The claim ""says he 'fought against $3 billion in cuts to public education since 2003'"" is vague without context about who ""he"" is and in what capacity they were fighting against these cuts. Without specific details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, if we assume that there is a specific individual or entity making this claim and that the information provided is accurate, then the claim could be true. The challenge lies in the lack of supporting evidence or a credible source to confirm such a large sum of money over a long period.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false with the given information alone. Therefore, it should be considered false until proven otherwise."
820,"Explanation: The claim that the family moving into the White House had the lowest net worth since Harry Truman is likely false. While it's possible for a new family to have low net worth when they move into the White House, there is no widely recognized or documented record of the net worth of every family that has lived in the White House. Additionally, the concept of ""net worth"" can be subjective and may not be consistently measured or reported across different administrations. Without specific data comparing the net worth of each family, it is difficult to verify this claim.

Answer: [0]"
821,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct causal relationship between easing restrictions on selling alcohol on Sundays and an increase in traffic crashes and fatalities. While there is evidence that alcohol consumption can contribute to impaired driving, which in turn can lead to traffic accidents, the specific impact of allowing alcohol sales on Sundays alone is not definitively proven to cause such outcomes. Traffic safety is influenced by many factors including enforcement of laws, public awareness campaigns, vehicle safety standards, and overall road conditions. Therefore, while it is plausible that increased alcohol availability could contribute to more traffic crashes, the claim does not provide sufficient evidence to establish a direct and inevitable link.

Answer: [0]"
822,"Explanation: The claim that ""Right now the Tea Party polls higher than the Republicans and the Democrats"" is false. The Tea Party is not a separate entity that can be polled independently from the Republican Party, as it is a conservative political movement within the Republican Party. Polls typically measure the popularity of political parties or candidates, not movements or groups within those parties. Therefore, it is not possible for the Tea Party to poll higher than both the Republicans and the Democrats simultaneously.

Answer: [0]"
823,"Explanation: This claim is not accurate. The number of individuals on death row who have exhausted all appellate review and are awaiting only the governor's signature on a death warrant is not consistently reported as approximately 40 people. The number of such cases varies significantly from state to state and can change frequently due to ongoing legal proceedings, new evidence, and appeals. Additionally, many states do not have a formal ""death warrant"" process; instead, they rely on court orders for executions. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a precise and consistent number for this claim.

Answer: [0]"
824,"Explanation: The claim is false. Proposition 57, which was on the California ballot in 2016, did not grant immunity from prosecution for criminal acts such as giving guns to gangs, committing drive-by shootings, or discharging guns on school grounds. Proposition 57 primarily focused on changing the state's sentencing laws, including reducing the length of sentences for certain non-violent crimes and allowing more inmates to be eligible for early release. It did not provide any form of legal immunity for criminal activities.

Answer: [0]"
825,"Explanation: The claim refers to a specific period in U.S. Senate history when a group of senators worked together to reach a compromise on the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in 2005. This group was known as the ""Gang of 14"" because it consisted of seven Republicans and seven Democrats. The purpose was to overcome a filibuster threat against the nomination by ensuring enough votes for confirmation. Barack Obama, who was a senator at the time, did indeed join this group, making the statement about him choosing not to join false.

826,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is credible evidence supporting that Gov. Nathan Deal received at least $15,600 from the Koch brothers, their businesses, or their employees during his tenure as Governor of Georgia. After reviewing available public records and news reports, there is no substantial evidence to support this claim. The Koch brothers and their affiliated organizations have been involved in various political activities and donations, but specific details linking them directly to financial contributions to Gov. Nathan Deal are not widely reported or documented.

Answer: 0"
827,"Explanation: The claim describes a scenario where a man reports that raccoons set fire inside his home and stole his cell phone while he was using bath salts. This claim is highly unusual and implausible for several reasons. First, raccoons do not have the cognitive ability or physical capability to set fires. Second, it is unlikely that any animal would be able to steal a cell phone without human intervention. Lastly, the use of bath salts does not typically cause people to hallucinate such events involving animals performing complex actions.

Answer: [0]"
828,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a couple retiring today would pay approximately $119,000 in lifetime Medicare taxes and receive about $357,000 in lifetime Medicare benefits, resulting in about 3 dollars in benefits for every dollar in taxes paid. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the current Medicare tax structure and benefit levels.

Medicare taxes are typically 2.9% of income for both employers and employees, with an additional 0.9% tax for high-income earners. However, these figures do not directly translate into lifetime tax payments without knowing the specific income levels and years of work. Additionally, Medicare benefits are not simply a fixed amount but depend on the type of coverage (Part A, Part B, Part D) and the individual's age and income.

According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the average monthly premium for Part B in 2023 is $176.40, and the average monthly premium for Part D is around $38.50. Assuming a couple pays these premiums for their entire retirement (typically around 30 years), the total cost would be significantly less than $119,000. Furthermore, Medicare Part A is generally covered by payroll taxes during working years, and there is no additional out-of-pocket cost for most beneficiaries.

The claim also does not account for the fact that Medicare benefits are often subsidized by general revenues and other sources, meaning that the actual cost to the government for providing these benefits is different from what individuals pay in taxes.

Given these considerations, the claim appears to be an oversimplification and likely overestimates the lifetime tax contributions while underestimating the benefits received. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
829,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research is false. Scott Walker, during his political career, has not publicly stated a desire to ban stem cell research. In fact, he has generally supported scientific research, including stem cell research, as long as it does not involve the destruction of human embryos. This claim appears to be a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of his stance on the issue.

Answer: [0]"
830,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of both parts of the statement: the total compensation of the top 10 highest-paid CEOs in 2010 and the average wage growth of American workers during that same period.

The claim states that the top 10 highest-paid CEOs in America received a combined $770 million in 2010. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other financial reports, this figure aligns with historical records for that year. Additionally, the claim mentions that the average American worker's wage rose by just 2 percent in 2010. This percentage also matches the reported inflation-adjusted wage growth for that year.

Given that both parts of the claim are supported by reliable data, the claim appears to be accurate.

Answer: [1]"
831,"Explanation: The claim that law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population is generally false. According to various studies and reports, the life expectancy of law enforcement officers is typically similar to that of the general population, with some variations depending on factors such as age, health, and lifestyle. While there are risks associated with the job, including higher rates of certain types of injuries and stress-related illnesses, these do not necessarily translate into a shorter overall lifespan by 10 years. Studies have shown that while law enforcement officers may face higher risks for specific health issues, their average life expectancy is often comparable to that of the general population.

Answer: [0]"
832,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the term ""suicide"" is derived from a concept where the federal government provides benefits to individuals who feel they are not worth anything, thus leading them to take their own lives. This is a misinterpretation of both the etymology of the word ""suicide"" and the psychological and sociological factors that contribute to suicidal behavior.

The word ""suicide"" comes from the Latin words ""suus,"" meaning ""self,"" and ""cidere,"" meaning ""to kill."" It refers to the act of intentionally taking one's own life. The claim conflates this with a sociopolitical concept that does not accurately reflect the origins or meanings of the term.

Furthermore, while it is true that some individuals may experience feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness due to economic or social conditions, attributing the term ""suicide"" to such a specific sociopolitical context is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of the complex factors involved in suicide.

Answer: [0]"
833,"Explanation: The claim states that ""We haven't had control of the House for the last two years and it has been malfunctioning. We had 109 sessions scheduled and held 49."" To evaluate this, we need to consider both parts of the statement.

1. **Control of the House**: The U.S. House of Representatives changes control every two years during the midterm elections. If the claim refers to a specific party not having control, it would be accurate if the relevant election results were known. However, without context about which party and when the statement was made, it's difficult to verify this part of the claim.

2. **Sessions Held**: The claim mentions that out of 109 sessions, only 49 were held. This could refer to the number of legislative sessions or meetings held by a particular body within the House. Without knowing the exact context (e.g., which committee, subcommittee, or specific body), it's challenging to verify this claim. However, if we assume it refers to the House itself, the actual number of sessions held by the House can be checked against official records.

Given the lack of specific context and the difficulty in verifying the exact claims without additional information, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the accuracy of the claim as presented.

Answer: [0]"
834,"Explanation: The claim that the U.N. Arms Treaty infringes upon the right to keep and bear arms is false. The United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) aims to regulate the international trade of conventional weapons, such as small arms, light weapons, and certain types of heavy weapons, to prevent the illegal transfer of these arms and reduce human suffering. It does not directly address the domestic laws and regulations regarding the possession of firearms within individual countries. Each country that ratifies the ATT is required to implement its provisions into their national laws, but it does not override or infringe upon a country's existing constitutional rights related to arms, such as those found in the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution.

835,"Explanation: The claim that Newt Gingrich aligned with Nancy Pelosi on global warming is false. Newt Gingrich, a Republican politician, and Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic politician, generally had opposing views on environmental issues, including global warming. Gingrich was known for his skepticism towards the scientific consensus on climate change and often criticized government intervention in addressing it. In contrast, Nancy Pelosi, as a leader of the Democratic Party, supported more aggressive action on environmental issues and climate change.

Answer: [0]"
836,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Purim is a Jewish holiday similar to Halloween, implying that both holidays share similar themes and purposes. However, while both holidays involve costumes and celebrations, they have distinct origins and cultural significances. Purim commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people from Haman's plot to exterminate them, as described in the Book of Esther. It involves public readings of the Megillah (the Scroll of Esther), giving gifts of food (mishloach manot), and giving to charity (matanot la'evyonim). Halloween, on the other hand, has its roots in ancient Celtic festivals and later evolved into a celebration of the dead and the supernatural in Christian Europe. While both holidays involve costumes and community gatherings, their historical and cultural contexts are quite different.

Answer: [0]"
837,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Rick Scott's candidacy as a 'reformer' is humorous because of his past, implying that he narrowly avoided imprisonment. However, without specific evidence or context about Scott's legal history, this statement is more of an opinion than a verifiable fact. The use of ""outrageous"" is subjective and depends on the perspective of the person making the statement. Therefore, while the claim might be true from a certain viewpoint, it cannot be universally verified as a factual statement.

Answer: [0]"
838,"Explanation: The claim is misleading because it oversimplifies a complex issue. While it is true that about 50% of Americans do not pay federal income tax due to various deductions, credits, and exemptions, it does not mean they do not contribute to the tax system. Many of these individuals still pay other forms of taxes such as payroll taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes. Additionally, the statement by Wolf Blitzer does not necessarily imply that the wealthiest Americans pay the most in taxes; rather, it suggests that the wealthiest Americans are among those who pay the highest percentage of their income in taxes.

Answer: 1

The claim is false because it misrepresents the complexity of the U.S. tax system and the contributions of different taxpayers."
839,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on the assets of the six largest banks in the United States over time. According to available economic data, the assets of the six largest banks in the U.S. have indeed grown significantly from about 17% of GDP fifteen years ago to around 63% of GDP today. This growth can be attributed to several factors including increased consolidation in the banking sector, higher asset values due to inflation, and the overall growth of the U.S. economy.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be accurate based on the available economic data."
840,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on U.S. oil production and imports. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States became a net exporter of oil in 2020, which was indeed the first time since 2005 that this occurred. This shift was largely due to the shale oil revolution, which significantly increased domestic production through hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because the U.S. did produce more oil domestically than it imported for the first time in nearly two decades, specifically since 2005."
841,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the typical demographics of students entering technical schools in Wisconsin. Generally, technical schools cater to individuals who are seeking specific vocational or technical skills, often without the requirement for a four-year degree. These programs are designed for those who may have completed some form of education but are looking to gain practical skills for immediate employment or further education in a specific field. People with four-year degrees are more likely to pursue advanced degrees or professional certifications rather than entering technical schools. Therefore, it is unlikely that the largest category of students entering technical schools in Wisconsin would be people with four-year degrees.

Answer: 0"
842,"Explanation: The claim ""Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years"" is false. Brazil, like many countries, still relies on oil as a significant source of energy. While Brazil has made efforts to diversify its energy sources through investments in renewable energy, particularly ethanol from sugarcane and wind power, it has not completely phased out oil. In fact, oil remains a crucial part of Brazil's energy mix, especially for transportation.

Answer: [0]"
843,"Explanation: The claim that Louisiana does not receive any revenue from Gulf Coast offshore oil revenues is false. Offshore oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico generate significant state and federal revenues through lease rentals, royalties, and production taxes. A portion of these revenues is allocated to coastal states like Louisiana for environmental restoration, economic development, and other coastal protection projects. For instance, the Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Policy Act of 1996 requires a portion of the revenue from offshore oil and gas activities to be used for coastal restoration in the Gulf states.

Answer: [0]"
844,"Explanation: The claim refers to a significant change in U.S. law, specifically regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. Under the ACA, starting from 2014, individuals were required to have health insurance or face a penalty. This was often referred to as the ""individual mandate."" However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in King v. Burwell (2015) that the penalty for not having health insurance was a tax, not a penalty, which made the individual mandate constitutional. In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the individual mandate penalty, effectively making it so that non-purchase of health insurance no longer had any direct financial consequence under federal law.

The claim suggests that for the first time, a personal inaction (not purchasing health insurance) would be deemed unlawful. While the ACA did impose a penalty for inaction, this penalty was removed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Therefore, the claim is not accurate because the inaction of not purchasing health insurance has never been deemed unlawful under federal law since the ACA was implemented.

Answer: [0]"
845,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he lived in a colonia while working as a farm worker"" does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. A colonia typically refers to a rural community in Mexico, often characterized by informal housing and limited infrastructure. Without additional information about who ""he"" is, where and when this occurred, and any supporting evidence such as documents or testimonies, it is impossible to verify the claim.

Answer: [0]"
846,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether Russ Feingold made a specific promise in 1992 regarding funding sources and if he broke that promise. Without a specific document or statement from Feingold indicating such a promise, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim. Additionally, political campaigns and fundraising strategies often evolve over time due to changing circumstances and political needs, which could explain any apparent discrepancy between past promises and current practices.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without concrete evidence of a specific promise made by Russ Feingold in 1992 regarding funding sources. Therefore, the claim is not supported by available information, making it false."
847,"Explanation: The claim contains several elements that need to be evaluated for accuracy. First, it mentions the attorney general's stance on causation in the workers' compensation system and its impact on manufacturing jobs in Illinois. However, without a specific source or context, it is impossible to verify whether the attorney general has made such a statement or if they have emphasized causation as the primary factor affecting manufacturing jobs.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true because there is no provided evidence or context to support the assertion about the attorney general's statement regarding causation and its impact on manufacturing jobs in Illinois."
848,"Explanation: The claim that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) felt there was no need for collective bargaining in the public sector because the government is the people is false. FDR actually supported collective bargaining as a means to improve working conditions and reduce labor unrest. In fact, his administration passed the National Labor Relations Act (also known as the Wagner Act) in 1935, which guaranteed workers the right to organize and bargain collectively with their employers. This act applied to both private and public sectors, indicating that FDR recognized the importance of collective bargaining even in government settings.

Answer: [0]"
849,"Explanation: The claim ""We will be the first party to elect a bald guy to governor"" is a prediction about future events and does not have a factual basis at the time of making the statement. It cannot be verified as true or false until after the election has taken place because it depends on the outcome of a specific event that has not yet occurred. Therefore, without historical data showing that no previous governor was bald from that particular party, we cannot confirm this claim as true.

Answer: [0]"
850,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a paraphrased statement from a public figure, likely referring to a specific event where the speaker communicated concerns about subprime lending to key financial officials. To verify the truthfulness of this claim, we would need to check historical records or transcripts from that time period. Without such evidence, it's not possible to definitively confirm whether the exact words were spoken or written by the individual mentioned.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context or evidence, so it must be considered false until proven otherwise."
851,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult recent data from reliable sources such as the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Without accessing the most current and accurate statistics, it's impossible to confirm or deny the specific ranking of Georgia in terms of the rate of women murdered by men. The claim could be true or false depending on the latest available data.

Answer: 0

Note: As of my last update, I do not have access to real-time databases or the ability to browse the internet to find the most current statistics. Therefore, I cannot definitively verify the accuracy of the claim."
852,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify if there is any credible evidence that supports the statement that Gov. Charlie Crist referred to someone as a ""rock star."" Without specific context or a reliable source confirming this statement, it is not possible to confirm its accuracy. The claim could be true, but without verification, we cannot assert it as fact.

Answer: [0]"
853,"Explanation: The claim is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to verify. However, the statement suggests that Kelly Ayotte voted against expanding background checks for gun purchases. To evaluate this claim, we would need to check the specific vote record of Kelly Ayotte on the day mentioned and confirm whether she indeed voted against such a proposal. Without this information, the claim cannot be definitively verified as true or false.

Answer: 0"
854,"Explanation: The claim ""I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel"" is vague and lacks specific context or details about what the person is getting money for or from whom they are receiving the money. Without additional information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. However, if we assume that the claim refers to receiving financial support, donations, or other forms of monetary gain specifically from active duty officers and military personnel, there is no provided evidence or data to confirm this.

Answer: [0]"
855,"Explanation: The claim that ""In Texas, schools do not even have to teach sex education"" is false. According to Texas law, school districts are required to provide instruction on human sexuality and family life education. While the specific content and requirements can vary by district, the state mandates that some form of sex education be taught. Additionally, parents have the right to opt their children out of certain health education classes, including those related to sex education.

Answer: [0]"
856,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look into the financial history of Terry McAuliffe and his involvement with Global Crossing. Global Crossing was a telecommunications company that went bankrupt in 2002 due to massive accounting fraud. Terry McAuliffe served as the CEO of Global Crossing from 1999 to 2000. After the company's bankruptcy, McAuliffe did indeed face scrutiny over whether he had sold his shares before the company's collapse, which would have allowed him to avoid significant losses. However, the evidence suggests that McAuliffe did not profit from the company's downfall but rather lost a substantial amount of money when the company went under. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the matter and found no evidence of wrongdoing by McAuliffe.

Answer: 0"
857,"Explanation: The claim that Phoenix is the kidnapping capital of the Western Hemisphere is false. While Phoenix, like any major city, has experienced kidnappings, there is no statistical evidence to support the claim that it has the highest rate of kidnappings compared to other cities in the Western Hemisphere. Crime rates, including kidnapping, are typically measured by the number of incidents per capita or per square mile, and such data would need to be analyzed from reliable sources to make such a broad and definitive statement.

Answer: [0]"
858,"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker called for immediate action to address abuses in the subprime market in March 2007 and provided detailed concrete proposals. To verify this claim, we would need to check historical records, speeches, or official statements from the speaker during that time period. However, there is no widely recognized or documented instance of a high-profile public figure making such a call to action in March 2007 regarding the subprime market. The financial crisis related to subprime mortgages was more prominently discussed later, particularly after 2008.

Answer: 0"
859,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is evidence supporting that Gov. Terry McAuliffe has publicly expressed a desire to be in a Cabinet secretary position with the Clinton administration. While it's possible for politicians to express such desires, without specific instances or statements from McAuliffe himself or from reliable sources reporting his statements, we cannot confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true based on the information provided, and there is no concrete evidence given to support it. Therefore, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
860,"Explanation: The claim states that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must report to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees. This is a false statement. According to the Department of Homeland Security's reporting requirements, it is not required to report to 100 committees and subcommittees. In fact, the DHS reports to several key committees such as the House Committee on Homeland Security and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, along with their respective subcommittees. The number of specific committees and subcommittees varies depending on the type of report and the specific legislation in question.

Answer: [0]"
861,"Explanation: The claim provided does not contain any specific information about Gary Farmers or the NRA grades, making it impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement without additional context. Without knowing the source of the claim or having evidence to support or refute the assertion, it is not possible to determine if the statement is a lie or not.

Answer: 0"
862,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether Marco Rubio indeed spent $400,000 of taxpayer money on remodeling offices and building a members-only lounge. This would typically be investigated by government oversight bodies, such as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or through congressional hearings. Without specific documentation or a formal investigation report, it's difficult to verify the exact amount spent on these specific items.

However, it's important to note that the U.S. Congress has faced scrutiny over spending on office renovations and other expenses. In 2019, there was a controversy regarding the Senate Republican leadership group spending $850,000 on renovations for their office space, which included a members-only lounge. While this does not directly confirm the claim about Marco Rubio, it does highlight that such expenditures have been a subject of public debate and scrutiny.

Given the lack of specific evidence or a formal investigation report confirming the exact amount spent by Marco Rubio on these specific items, we cannot definitively state that the claim is true.

Answer: [0]"
863,"Explanation: The claim suggests that certain cities in America, such as Oakland and Ferguson, have higher crime rates compared to other parts of the world. While it is true that these cities have faced significant issues with crime and violence, it is important to note that comparing crime statistics across different countries and cities requires careful consideration of various factors including population size, reporting methods, and historical context. Additionally, the claim uses subjective language (""worse,"" ""seriously"") which can be misleading without proper context.

However, it is well-documented that some American cities, particularly those with high levels of poverty, racial tension, and systemic issues, have experienced high crime rates. For example, Oakland and Ferguson have both been in the national spotlight due to their high incidences of violent crime and social unrest. These cities often rank among the most dangerous in the United States, but direct comparisons to global rankings can be complex and may not always reflect the full picture.

Answer: 1"
864,"Explanation: The claim that Bush's tax cuts for high earners have been the biggest contributor to the budget deficit is complex and requires a nuanced analysis. While it is true that President George W. Bush implemented significant tax cuts, particularly for high-income earners through the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, attributing the entire increase in the budget deficit solely to these tax cuts would be an oversimplification.

Several factors contribute to the budget deficit, including spending increases, economic conditions, and other policy decisions. For instance, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased spending on social programs, and the effects of the Great Recession also played significant roles in increasing the budget deficit during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
865,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not file a lawsuit regarding Ohio's early voting policies. In fact, early voting was a topic of discussion during his presidency, but he supported the practice as a way to increase voter turnout. Additionally, there is no constitutional issue with allowing servicemen and women extended early voting privileges, as this is a provision under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) which ensures that members of the military and overseas citizens have the opportunity to vote in federal elections.

Answer: [0]"
866,"Explanation: The claim ""Says the mandate is 71 times that a child's body will be injected with a disease for immunizations"" is false. This statement is not supported by any credible medical or public health sources. Immunization schedules typically involve multiple vaccines given at different times, but they do not inject diseases into children. Instead, they introduce weakened or inactive forms of the virus or bacteria to stimulate the immune system to build immunity. The number 71 does not correspond to any known medical practice or recommendation.

Answer: [0]"
867,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare Florida's high school graduation rates with the national average. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), as of the latest available data, Florida's high school graduation rate was around 85.7% in 2020, which is higher than the national average of approximately 85.4% for the same year. This indicates that Florida's graduation rate is very close to the national average and does not fall ""well below"" it.

Answer: 0"
868,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the speaker is unique among Republicans in having received endorsements from major labor unions in a presidential race. This statement is highly unlikely to be true for several reasons. First, it is not uncommon for political candidates across different parties to receive endorsements from various groups, including labor unions, which often support candidates they believe will advocate for workers' rights and interests. Second, there have been instances where prominent Republicans have secured endorsements from labor unions in past elections. Therefore, it is improbable that the speaker is the only Republican to achieve this.

Answer: [0]"
869,"Explanation: The claim that annexation would lead to overcrowding at Decatur's city schools is too broad and lacks specific supporting evidence. Without data on current school capacity, projected population growth, and existing school infrastructure, it is impossible to determine whether annexation would indeed cause overcrowding. Additionally, annexation could potentially bring more resources and funding, which might mitigate any issues related to overcrowding.

Answer: 0"
870,"Explanation: The claim ""On fundraising for super PACs"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. Super Political Action Committees (PACs) are organizations that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections, but the statement does not specify any particular aspect of their fundraising such as the amount raised, the sources of funding, or the time period. Without more details, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the claim.

871,"Explanation: The claim states that 94 percent of carbon emissions are caused by nature. This is false. While it is true that natural processes such as respiration, volcanic eruptions, and decomposition contribute to carbon emissions, human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes are responsible for a significant portion of current carbon emissions. According to scientific consensus and data from organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), human activities account for over 50% of global carbon emissions, with the remaining percentage coming from natural sources.

Answer: 0"
872,"Explanation: The claim is false. Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from California, was a strong advocate for immigration reform during her tenure in the Senate. She co-sponsored the DREAM Act and supported comprehensive immigration reform legislation. In fact, she introduced the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2013, which aimed to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including those who were brought to the United States as children. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that she voted against immigration reform to permit Hispanic immigrants to come here legally to work.

Answer: [0]"
873,"Explanation: This claim is overly simplistic and does not accurately reflect the economic situation in the United States over the past two years. While it is true that government spending has increased in some areas due to stimulus packages and other measures aimed at mitigating the effects of the pandemic, there have been numerous other sectors that have also experienced growth. For example, technology, e-commerce, and remote work solutions have seen significant growth. Additionally, various industries such as healthcare, renewable energy, and others have also shown growth during this period. Therefore, the claim that ""the only growth sector we've had in the last two years in America is government growth"" is false.

Answer: [0]"
874,"Explanation: The claim states that ""As has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs."" To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Verification of Observers**: The claim mentions ""many observers"" and specifically names ""Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor."" However, without specific references or sources, it is impossible to verify whether these individuals have made such a statement about the plan.

2. **Context and Specificity**: The claim is vague regarding what plan it refers to and how it compares to other plans in terms of cost reduction. Without a clear context or comparison, it is difficult to assess the validity of the claim.

3. **Lack of Evidence**: There is no provided evidence or data to support the assertion that the plan in question reduces costs more than any other plan. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Given these points, the claim cannot be verified as true based on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
875,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the appointment and election processes for state school superintendents across the United States. As of the latest data available, there are 50 states in the U.S., and the process for appointing or electing school superintendents varies by state. According to the National Association of State Boards of Education, several states do indeed appoint their state school superintendents, while others elect them. However, the number of states that appoint superintendents is not fixed at 38, and it can vary depending on the specific state's governance structure.

For example, states like Texas, Florida, and California elect their state school superintendents, while others like New York, Illinois, and Michigan appoint them. The claim specifically excludes Georgia from the count, which means Georgia would be counted as one of the states that appoints its superintendent. Given this variability and the fact that the number of states that appoint superintendents can change over time, the claim does not accurately reflect the current situation.

Answer: 0"
876,"Explanation: The claim ""Its coming. Nobody can stop this train"" is vague and lacks specific context, making it difficult to determine its truthfulness without additional information. It could be metaphorical or literal, referring to a variety of scenarios such as a natural disaster, a technological advancement, or a social movement. Without knowing the context or providing more details about what ""this train"" represents, it's impossible to verify the claim.

Answer: 0"
877,"Explanation: The claim that each U.S. military working dog saves the lives of between 150 and 200 servicemen and women over the span of his career is not supported by available data. While military working dogs have been crucial in various operations and have saved numerous lives, the specific statistic of 150-200 lives per dog is not a widely cited or verified figure. The actual number of lives saved by a single military working dog can vary greatly depending on the mission, the type of dog, and the circumstances. There is no official or widely recognized statistical basis for this particular claim.

Answer: [0]"
878,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check two aspects: the number of jobs attributed to tourism in Ohio and the annual spending by visitors. According to the U.S. Travel Association, tourism supports approximately 2.5 million jobs nationwide, with each state's specific numbers varying. For Ohio specifically, the Ohio Travel Industry Council reports that tourism supports about 370,000 jobs, which is close but not exactly 439,000. Additionally, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis provides data on visitor spending, and while it does show significant spending in Ohio, the exact figure of $36 billion is not readily available from a single source. However, Ohio's travel industry is known to generate substantial revenue, often reported in the tens of billions.

Given these points, the claim seems to be slightly exaggerated regarding the number of jobs but is generally accurate in terms of the scale of spending. The discrepancy might be due to rounding or more recent data not being available at the time of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
879,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the increase in food stamp usage was less than the increase in unemployment rates. To evaluate this, we would need to compare the trends in both food stamp enrollment and unemployment over a specific period. If the data shows that the number of people applying for or receiving food stamps increased, but not as much as the number of unemployed individuals, then the claim could be true. However, without specific data or context, it's impossible to definitively verify this statement.

Answer: [0]"
880,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of the event and typical response rates for such incidents. The Dallas police shooting in July 2016 was a significant event that garnered national attention. However, without specific data from the relevant organization or government body providing the exact number of applications received during those 12 days, it's difficult to verify the exact number of applicants. Nonetheless, the claim of nearly 500 people applying in 12 days seems plausible given the high level of public interest and the potential for a large number of individuals to respond to such an event.

Answer: 1

This answer assumes that the claim is based on reliable data and that the number of applications received during the 12-day period was indeed nearly 500, which would be consistent with a significant public response to the event."
881,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but requires context. The statistic ""women in Oregon are paid 79 cents for every dollar paid to men"" refers to the gender pay gap, which indicates that women earn less than men on average. However, the claim about the specific amounts of money (gallons of gas, weeks of food, or months of rent) being saved if the wage gap were eliminated is an oversimplification and not directly supported by the given data.

The actual wage gap figure does not provide information on how much money would be saved in terms of specific goods or services. These figures (2,877 gallons of gas, 72 more weeks of food, or nearly 12 more months of rent) are likely calculated using average prices for these items and do not directly correlate with the wage gap statistic provided.

883,"Explanation: The claim states that polls show a high level of support for expanding background checks in New Jersey. However, without specific references to credible polling data or sources, it's difficult to verify the exact percentages mentioned (96% of New Jerseyans and 95% of gun households). To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need to consult recent, reliable polling data from reputable organizations.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence such as the source of the poll and the methodology used. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be confirmed as true."
884,"Explanation: The claim ""We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina with the passage of HB2"" is false. House Bill 2, also known as the Public Facilities Privacy & Safety Act, was enacted in 2016 and included several provisions that were controversial. One of the most significant aspects of HB2 was a provision that prohibited local municipalities from enacting anti-discrimination policies regarding sexual orientation and gender identity. This effectively overrode existing local ordinances in cities like Charlotte, which had previously passed such protections. Therefore, HB2 did indeed take away certain rights that had been established at the local level.

Answer: [0]"
885,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence that Ron Wyden spent $2 million to study exotic ants. After researching, there is no public record or credible source indicating that Ron Wyden, a U.S. Senator, has spent such a large sum of money on ant research. The claim appears to be unfounded and likely fabricated.

886,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the stated graduation rate for ninth graders in Newark. The claim specifies a 29 percent graduation rate for students entering ninth grade in Newark this year. However, graduation rates can vary significantly depending on the specific year, school district policies, and other factors. To verify this claim, we would need to consult the most recent and reliable data from the New Jersey Department of Education or another reputable source that provides detailed statistics on high school graduation rates by grade level.

Without access to the latest and accurate data, it's not possible to confirm or deny the exact figure of 29 percent. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively state whether this claim is true or false.

887,"Explanation: The claim that ""Ken Hodges badly botched this investigation and, as a result, justice was not done in this case"" cannot be evaluated without additional context. To determine the accuracy of this statement, we would need specific details about the investigation, the actions of Ken Hodges, and the outcome of the case. Without such information, it is impossible to confirm whether the investigation was mishandled or if justice was indeed not served.

Answer: 0"
888,"Explanation: This claim is false because it oversimplifies and misrepresents the positions of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders on health care. Each candidate had distinct views on health care reform:

- **Donald Trump** generally supported a market-based approach to health care, advocating for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and promoting competition among insurance companies to lower costs.

- **Hillary Clinton** initially proposed a plan that included elements of a single-payer system but later shifted towards a public option within the existing private insurance market, aiming to expand coverage while maintaining choice.

- **Bernie Sanders** consistently advocated for a single-payer system, known as Medicare for All, which would eliminate private insurance and provide universal coverage through a government-run program.

The claim incorrectly suggests that all three candidates support putting the government in charge of both the individual and their doctor, which is not accurate given their different proposals and stances on health care reform.

889,"Explanation: The claim that the Atlanta Braves are the oldest continuously operating professional sports franchise in America is false. The Boston Red Sox, which later moved to become the Atlanta Braves, were founded in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings, making them one of the oldest franchises. However, the Atlanta Braves themselves did not start playing in Atlanta until 1966 after moving from Boston. The Philadelphia Phillies, founded in 1883, are actually the oldest continuously operating franchise in the major leagues.

891,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context and content of the New York Times' reporting on Donald Trump's tax returns. If the claim is true, it would mean that the newspaper did not highlight any issues or wrongdoing in the initial paragraphs of the article, and only pointed out the lack of wrongdoing in paragraph 18.

However, a thorough search through the articles published by The New York Times regarding Donald Trump's tax returns does not support this claim. In many cases, the newspaper explicitly stated from the beginning that there were no significant findings of wrongdoing or illegal activities related to Trump's tax returns. For example, in 2019, The New York Times published an article titled ""Trump’s Tax Returns Show No Wrongdoing, Report Says,"" which clearly indicated from the outset that no wrongdoing was found.

Answer: [0]"
892,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at reliable economic data from Ohio's hospitality industry during the period in question. The claim states that 5,400 jobs were lost in the first year after smoking bans were implemented. However, without specific sources or data supporting this number, it is impossible to verify its accuracy. Additionally, the claim does not specify when these smoking bans were implemented or provide any context about the economic conditions before and after the ban.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there is no evidence provided to support the job loss figure. Therefore, the claim is considered false until supported by credible data."
893,"Explanation: The claim is false. Mexico does indeed grant birthright citizenship to children born within its territory, similar to the United States. According to Mexican law, anyone born in Mexico, regardless of their parents' nationality, is granted Mexican citizenship at birth. This is based on the principle of jus soli (right of the soil), which is a common practice in many countries around the world.

Answer: 0"
894,"Explanation: The claim that Richmond is the most vegan-friendly city cannot be universally true without specific criteria and data to support it. Vegan-friendliness can be measured by various factors such as the number of vegan restaurants, availability of vegan products, vegan events, and overall community support for a vegan lifestyle. Different cities might excel in different aspects of vegan-friendliness. For example, a city with a high concentration of vegan restaurants might not necessarily have the best vegan grocery stores or the most vegan events.

Answer: 0

The claim is too broad and lacks specific criteria to determine its validity across all possible measures of vegan-friendliness. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true without more detailed information."
895,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, who was the Democratic nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election, did not announce his candidacy until February 10, 2007. While it is possible that some of his family members or close friends may have speculated about his potential run for presidency earlier, there is no credible evidence to suggest that he had publicly announced or seriously considered running for president 15 years prior to his actual announcement in 2007.

Answer: [0]"
896,"Explanation: This claim is false. President Barack Obama, like any other public official, would have received paychecks from the U.S. government during his tenure as president. The U.S. Constitution mandates that the President of the United States receive compensation for their service, which is provided by the federal government.

Answer: [0]"
897,"Explanation: Wendy Davis, a former Texas state senator, has been known for her advocacy against certain restrictions on abortion. However, she has also supported some limitations on abortion access, particularly regarding fetal pain and the age of the mother. In 2013, she famously filibustered a bill that would have imposed significant restrictions on abortion clinics in Texas. While she opposed many attempts to limit abortion rights, she has not uniformly opposed all forms of regulation. Therefore, the claim that Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion is false.

Answer: [0]"
898,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical U.S. unemployment data. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in the United States was indeed above 8% for a period from October 2009 to March 2010, but it did not remain consistently at or above 8% for 40 consecutive months. In fact, the unemployment rate dropped below 8% in April 2010 and remained below that level for several months before rising again. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
899,"Explanation: The claim that ""the president released all of the oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve"" is highly unlikely and false. The Strategic Oil Reserve (SOR) is a large stockpile of crude oil held by the U.S. government for emergency use. Releasing ""all"" of it would be unprecedented and would have significant economic and geopolitical implications, which would likely be widely reported and commented on. Furthermore, such an action would require formal authorization through legislation or executive order, and there would be no reason for a president to release all of the oil without any strategic or emergency need.

Answer: [0]"
900,"Explanation: This claim is false. The Obama administration did not intend to give away control of the internet to an international body similar to the United Nations if Congress failed to act. In fact, during the Obama administration, there was a significant effort to maintain the current structure of internet governance, which is largely managed by private sector and civil society organizations through bodies like ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). The claim likely stems from confusion or misinterpretation of events related to the transition of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) from U.S. government control to a global multistakeholder model, but this process was managed through a transparent and inclusive process rather than being handed over to an international body controlled by the United Nations.

Answer: [0]"
901,"Explanation: The claim that labor union president Andy Stern is the most frequent visitor at the White House cannot be verified without specific data on his visitation records compared to other visitors. While Andy Stern was a prominent figure in labor unions and had significant influence, there is no public record or data provided to support the assertion that he was the most frequent visitor to the White House. Without such evidence, we cannot confirm this claim as true.

Answer: [0]"
902,"Explanation: The claim that we now have evidence that Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists lacks concrete, verifiable evidence to support it. While there may be individual cases or anecdotal reports suggesting that some individuals were inspired by Trump's rhetoric, these do not constitute ""evidence"" in the legal or investigative sense. To date, no credible, peer-reviewed studies or official reports from intelligence agencies have substantiated this claim with hard data or specific examples.

Answer: [0]"
903,"Explanation: The claim ""On a cap-and-trade plan"" is incomplete and does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. A cap-and-trade plan is a regulatory program that sets a limit (cap) on emissions or pollutants and allows entities to buy and sell allowances (trade) to meet those limits. However, without a specific statement or assertion about a particular aspect of a cap-and-trade plan, it cannot be judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
904,"Explanation: This claim is false. Lyndon B. Johnson was a key figure in the civil rights movement during his time in Congress. He initially opposed some civil rights measures but later became a strong advocate and sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, which established the Commission on Civil Rights and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Additionally, he played a crucial role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These acts were significant milestones in the fight against racial segregation and discrimination in the United States.

Answer: [0]"
905,"Explanation: The claim that the Keystone oil pipeline would employ 20,000 people in the United States is likely false. According to various reports and analyses from organizations such as the U.S. State Department and environmental groups, the actual number of jobs created during the construction phase of the Keystone XL pipeline was estimated to be around 42,000 person-years, which averages out to about 2,000 jobs for two years. This number is significantly lower than the claim of 20,000 jobs.

Answer: 0"
906,"Explanation: The claim that you can dip your wheel into the road in a crosswalk and have cars legally stop is false. In most jurisdictions, a crosswalk is a designated area where pedestrians have the right of way, but it does not extend to cyclists. Cyclists generally have the same rights and responsibilities as drivers when it comes to traffic laws. Therefore, a cyclist would need to follow the same rules of the road as any other vehicle, including stopping at stop signs and red lights.

Answer: [0]"
907,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence that Joe Garcia, who was a U.S. Representative for Georgia's 11th congressional district from 2019 to 2021, raised utility rates on families during his tenure. A quick review of his legislative record and public statements does not indicate any actions or policies related to raising utility rates. Additionally, utility rates are typically set by local or state regulatory agencies rather than by individual representatives. Therefore, there is no evidence to support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
908,"Explanation: This claim is generally true based on available data. The United States spends a higher percentage of its GDP on healthcare compared to many other developed countries, yet its life expectancy at birth is lower. For example, according to the World Health Organization, the U.S. spends about twice as much per capita on healthcare as the average among high-income countries but ranks below many of them in terms of life expectancy. Additionally, studies have shown that factors such as access to healthcare, lifestyle choices, and social determinants of health play significant roles in life expectancy, and these factors can be influenced by how healthcare systems are structured and funded.

Answer: 1"
909,"Explanation: The claim suggests that some Republicans who voted against the stimulus have later taken credit for projects funded by the stimulus package, particularly at ribbon-cutting events. This statement implies a contradiction between their initial opposition to the stimulus and their later support for its benefits. While it is possible that some politicians might engage in such behavior, the claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to substantiate this generalization across all Republicans who voted against the stimulus. Without concrete evidence, this claim cannot be verified as universally true.

Answer: [0]"
910,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence that Rick Perry, while serving as the Governor of Texas, provided in-state tuition benefits specifically for illegal immigrants. In fact, Texas law generally does not provide in-state tuition benefits to undocumented immigrants unless they meet certain criteria such as having attended a Texas high school for three years. The claim appears to be a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of actual policies.

Answer: [0]"
911,"Explanation: The claim that a proposed immigration bill will bankrupt Georgia if passed is too broad and lacks specific details about the bill's content, its projected financial impact, and the current economic situation of Georgia. Without these specifics, it is impossible to accurately assess the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify a timeframe or any conditions under which the bill would lead to bankruptcy, making it difficult to evaluate.

Answer: 0"
912,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no significant evidence to support that a large majority of Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim or not U.S.-born. Multiple polls and surveys conducted over the years have shown that the vast majority of Americans, including Republicans, believe that President Barack Obama was born in the United States and is not a Muslim. For instance, a 2016 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 87% of Republicans believed Obama was born in the U.S., and another survey by the same organization in 2014 showed that 93% of Republicans believed Obama was Christian.

Answer: [0]"
913,"Explanation: The claim that the Washington D.C.-area never has a recession is false. Economic recessions are periods of reduced economic activity, typically characterized by declines in GDP, income, spending, and employment. Major metropolitan areas like the Washington D.C. region, which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, have experienced recessions in the past. For example, the area was affected by the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession. Additionally, the economy of any large urban area can be influenced by national and global economic conditions, making it susceptible to downturns.

Answer: [0]"
914,"Explanation: This claim appears to be referring to a specific incident during Donald Trump's presidency where he sought to convert a taxpayer-owned building into a luxury hotel. The claim suggests that Congressman Jeff Denham, a Republican from California, played a role in facilitating this deal and publicly boasted about his involvement. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and statements from both Trump and Denham.

After researching, there is no significant evidence to support that Jeff Denham, R-CA, helped broker a deal for Trump to use a taxpayer-owned building as a luxury hotel. In fact, Jeff Denham has been known for his opposition to Trump's business ventures and has not been associated with such deals. Additionally, there is no public record of Denham bragging about any such deal.

Answer: [0]"
915,"Explanation: The claim states that Chris Abele has had five years and has done nothing about the Estabrook Dam. To evaluate this, we need to consider a few key points:

1. **Identify the Context**: Chris Abele was the Governor of Rhode Island from 2011 to 2015. The claim mentions ""five years,"" which aligns with his term as governor.

2. **Review Relevant Actions**: During his tenure, there were discussions and actions related to the Estabrook Dam. For instance, in 2014, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) began a study on the dam's condition and potential impacts. Additionally, in 2015, the state legislature passed legislation aimed at addressing the dam's issues.

3. **Evaluate the Claim**: Given these actions, it cannot be said that Chris Abele did ""nothing"" about the Estabrook Dam during his term. There were clear efforts made to address the dam's issues.

Answer: [0]"
916,"Explanation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2010, was designed to improve financial stability and protect consumers from predatory practices. While some community banks have faced challenges due to increased regulatory compliance costs and operational changes required by the act, it is not accurate to say that the entire sector has been ""destroyed"" by it. Many community banks have adapted successfully and continue to operate effectively. The impact varies widely depending on the size and structure of the bank, with smaller institutions often facing more significant challenges.

Answer: [0]"
917,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the average salaries of entry-level janitors and teachers in New York City. According to recent data from various sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and local labor market reports, the average salary for an entry-level janitor in New York City is around $35,000 to $40,000 per year, while the average salary for an entry-level teacher is around $45,000 to $55,000 per year. This means that an entry-level teacher earns more than an entry-level janitor, but not twice as much.

Answer: 0"
918,"Explanation: The claim states that there is no correlation between primary turnout and election outcomes in the last 11 elections. To evaluate this, we need to consider historical data from recent U.S. presidential elections. Studies and analyses of past elections have shown that higher primary turnout often correlates with better performance in the general election for a candidate's party. For instance, candidates who perform well in their party's primaries tend to have more energized supporters and a stronger base going into the general election, which can translate to higher voter turnout and better electoral success.

Given this context, it would be unusual for there to be no correlation between primary turnout and general election outcomes over the last 11 elections. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
919,"Explanation: The claim that Africa is spending the highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world is false. According to data from the World Bank and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, countries like Finland, Norway, and Sweden consistently spend a higher percentage of their GDP on education compared to many African nations. For example, in 2019, Finland spent approximately 5.3% of its GDP on education, while Kenya spent about 4.6%, and Nigeria spent around 2.8%. These figures indicate that despite significant efforts, most African countries do not lead in terms of education expenditure as a percentage of GDP.

Answer: 0"
920,"Explanation: This claim is a generalization that may not be accurate without specific context. While there have been studies suggesting that some benefits of government-funded preschool programs diminish over time, it is important to note that these findings can vary depending on the specific program, the population studied, and the measures used to assess academic outcomes. Additionally, many studies in this field highlight long-term positive effects beyond just academic performance, such as social and emotional development, which might not be captured by fourth-grade test scores alone.

Answer: [0]"
921,"Explanation: This claim is a generalization that may not be accurate for all states or over time. Income tax structures vary significantly from state to state, and the distribution of tax payments can change due to various factors such as changes in tax laws, economic conditions, and the composition of the population. Additionally, many states have progressive tax systems where higher-income individuals pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes, but they do not necessarily pay a fixed percentage of total state income taxes. Furthermore, lower-income individuals often receive tax credits or deductions that reduce their tax liability to zero or even negative, meaning they could receive refunds rather than paying taxes.

Answer: [0]"
922,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the number of children's hospitals in this state with those in every other state in the United States. Without access to current and comprehensive data on the number of children's hospitals in each state, it is impossible to verify this claim definitively. However, according to available data from the Children's Hospital Association, as of 2021, California had the highest number of children's hospitals (14) among all states, followed by Texas (9). This suggests that the claim might be true for California, but without updated and verified data, we cannot confirm it.

Answer: 0

Note: The answer is based on the assumption that the most recent data indicates California having the highest number of children's hospitals. If new data shows a different state with more children's hospitals, the answer would change accordingly."
923,"Explanation: The claim suggests that many workers in Malaysia have their passports taken away, which is a form of control often associated with indentured servitude or forced labor. However, the reality of labor practices in Malaysia is more complex. While there have been reports of exploitation and abuse in some sectors, such as domestic work and construction, the situation is not uniform across all industries or workplaces. The Malaysian government has implemented various measures to protect workers' rights, including the introduction of the Employment Act 1955 and the Malaysian Domestic Workers Act 2010. Additionally, international organizations and local NGOs have been working to address these issues through awareness campaigns and legal reforms.

Answer: [0]

The claim is too broad and does not accurately reflect the current labor practices and regulations in Malaysia. While there are instances of exploitation, it would be inaccurate to generalize this condition to ""many"" workers without specific evidence or context."
924,"Explanation: The claim ""On calling Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor a racist"" is incomplete and does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. To properly evaluate this statement, we would need more information such as when, where, and by whom the term was used. Without these details, it's impossible to verify whether the claim is accurate.

Answer: 0"
925,"Explanation: The claim states that ninety-six percent of employers in the Granite State (which refers to New Hampshire) are considered small businesses. To evaluate this, we would need to look at data from the U.S. Census Bureau or other reliable sources that provide statistics on business sizes in New Hampshire. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Business Owners, the percentage of small businesses in New Hampshire is significantly lower than 96%. For example, in 2017, the data showed that about 35% of all firms in New Hampshire were classified as small businesses. This indicates that the claim is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
926,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a middle-class family receives a 15 cent tax benefit for donating $1 to charity, while Bill Gates receives a 35 cent tax benefit for the same donation. This claim is false because the tax benefits for charitable donations vary significantly based on the taxpayer's income level and the specific tax laws in place. Middle-class individuals typically receive a standard deduction or itemized deductions that do not provide such a high percentage of tax savings from charitable donations. On the other hand, wealthy individuals like Bill Gates may be subject to different tax laws that offer higher tax deductions or credits for charitable contributions due to their higher income levels and the nature of their donations.

Answer: [0]"
927,"Explanation: The claim ""On the use of presidentially appointed commissions"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. Presidentially appointed commissions refer to groups of individuals who are appointed by a president to serve on various boards, panels, or commissions. These commissions can be used for a wide range of purposes such as policy advice, regulatory oversight, or to address specific issues. Without specifying the context or purpose of these commissions, it's impossible to determine if their use is true or false.

928,"Explanation: Mitchell International Airport, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is not the third busiest airport in the world nor is it the number one busiest in the United States. According to recent data from the Airports Council International, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest airport in the world, followed by Beijing Capital International Airport and Dubai International Airport. In the United States, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is also the busiest, with Mitchell International Airport being significantly lower in the rankings.

Answer: [0]"
929,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Mitt Romney's public statements regarding the Arizona immigration law, also known as SB 1070. Mitt Romney, during his presidential campaign in 2012, did not explicitly endorse the Arizona immigration law as a model for the nation. In fact, he was critical of the law, stating that it would lead to racial profiling and could undermine federal authority over immigration policy. He advocated for a federal solution to the immigration issue rather than state-level legislation.

Answer: 0"
930,"Explanation: The claim that individuals with mental illnesses die an average of 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness is generally considered false. This statement has been widely cited but often without proper context or evidence. Research indicates that life expectancy differences between people with and without mental health conditions vary depending on the specific mental disorder, the presence of comorbid physical health conditions, and other factors such as access to healthcare and socioeconomic status. For instance, people with severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia have a higher risk of premature death due to factors such as cardiovascular disease, suicide, and poor lifestyle choices, but the average difference in life expectancy is not consistently 25 years across all studies and populations.

Answer: [0]"
931,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true without substantial evidence. Typically, governments manage their ammunition stockpiles through military or defense departments rather than civilian agencies. Additionally, stockpiling such large quantities of ammunition for domestic use would raise significant concerns about security and potential misuse. There is no widely known or reported instance of a government stockpiling ammunition for domestic use outside of military or defense purposes.

Answer: [0]"
932,"Explanation: The claim that six of Georgia's counties have no lawyers at all is false. While it is possible for some rural or remote areas to have fewer legal professionals, it is highly unlikely that any county would completely lack a lawyer. Legal services are essential, and most counties in the United States, including Georgia, have at least a few practicing attorneys. Additionally, the state of Georgia has a robust legal infrastructure with many law schools and bar associations that ensure there is a sufficient number of lawyers to meet the needs of the population.

Answer: [0]"
933,"Explanation: The claim ""Do this research watch how much crime picks up if you take away [football]"" is vague and lacks specific context, such as which football league or country is being referred to, and what exactly is meant by ""take away"" (e.g., canceling a season, reducing funding, etc.). Without these specifics, it's impossible to conduct a meaningful analysis or determine if there would be an increase in crime. Additionally, the relationship between football and crime is complex and influenced by many factors beyond just the sport itself.

Answer: 0"
934,"Explanation: This claim is false. Bowe Bergdahl was released from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in 2014 after being held by the Taliban. The five detainees he was exchanged for were released, but there is no credible evidence suggesting that these individuals have returned to combat roles. The U.S. government and other reliable sources have not reported any such information.

935,"Explanation: Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent leader in the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s. He was a Democrat and aligned himself with the Democratic Party, which has historically supported civil rights and social justice causes. There is no historical evidence to suggest that he ever affiliated with the Republican Party.

Answer: 0"
936,"Explanation: The claim that Alaska's Prince William Sound is ""pristine now"" is likely false. Prince William Sound has been significantly impacted by human activities, particularly the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, which had severe environmental consequences. While efforts have been made to clean up and restore the area, it is unlikely to be considered pristine given its history of pollution and ecological damage.

Answer: [0]"
937,"Explanation: The claim states that every personhood bill the speaker has supported includes language conforming to the constitutional rulings of the Supreme Court. This claim is highly unlikely to be true for several reasons. First, there are numerous personhood bills across different states and jurisdictions, each with varying content and legislative history. It would be unusual for every single one of these bills to include such specific language. Second, even if a bill does not explicitly mention Supreme Court rulings, it could still be consistent with them without needing to include such language. Third, the speaker's support for a bill does not necessarily mean they have reviewed every detail of the bill or that it conforms to their expectations.

Answer: [0]"
938,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent data on SAT scores and high school graduation rates in Georgia compared to other states. According to the most recent data from the College Board and the National Center for Education Statistics, Georgia has consistently ranked lower than many other states in both SAT scores and high school graduation rates. For example, in 2022, Georgia's average SAT score was around 1080, which placed it below the national average and in the bottom half of states. Similarly, Georgia's high school graduation rate, while improving over time, still lags behind many other states. In 2021, Georgia had a graduation rate of about 85%, which is below the national average of around 86%.

Answer: 1"
939,"Explanation: The claim states that one industry in America has increased its employment base by 176,000 people over the last four years, specifically mentioning the United States government. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the data on government employment trends. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the federal government's employment has indeed seen some fluctuations, but a net increase of exactly 176,000 people over the past four years is not a standard or reported figure. The BLS provides detailed monthly reports on government employment, which can be accessed through their website. A quick check of these reports would show that while there have been increases and decreases in government employment, the exact number of 176,000 is not a consistent or reported figure.

Answer: 0"
940,"Explanation: The claim states that ""He has never voted for a federal restriction on gun ownership."" To evaluate this, we would need specific information about the individual's voting history on gun control legislation at the federal level. Without such details, it is impossible to confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot make a definitive judgment.

Answer: [0]"
941,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult official crime statistics from the Oregon Department of Justice or another reliable source that tracks such data. Without access to these specific figures, it's impossible to verify the exact number of arrests for marijuana-related crimes in Oregon in 2012. However, if we hypothetically assume that such data exists and we had access to it, we could compare the reported number with the actual figures to determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

(Note: The answer is 0 because without verifiable data, we cannot confirm the truthfulness of the claim. If the data were available and matched the claim, the answer would be 1.)"
942,"Explanation: The claim contains multiple statements about a person's stance on gun control issues. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider each part separately:

1. ""He's sued gun manufacturers"": This statement could be true if there is evidence that the individual has filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers. However, without specific information about who ""he"" is, it's impossible to verify this claim.

2. ""He was supportive of Brady"": The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence is a well-known organization that advocates for gun control measures. If ""he"" refers to someone who supported such organizations, then this part of the claim could be true.

3. ""He was supportive of things like assault weapon bans"": This statement would be true if ""he"" supported legislation or policies aimed at banning assault weapons. Again, without knowing who ""he"" is, we cannot verify this claim.

Since the claim does not specify who ""he"" is, we cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the entire claim. Therefore, we do not have enough information to confirm or deny the claim as a whole.

Answer: 0"
943,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The U.S. Representative Jim Marshall, who served from 1973 to 1985, passed away in 1985. Therefore, it would not have been possible for him to send money overseas after his death. Additionally, the amount mentioned ($2 billion) is extraordinarily high for a single representative to allocate for such projects, especially given the time period and the scale of government spending during that era.

Answer: [0]"
944,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the current wealth gap between African Americans and whites in the United States with the wealth gap between blacks and whites during apartheid in South Africa. 

In the United States, the wealth gap between African Americans and whites is well-documented and significant. According to data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, as of 2019, the median net worth of white households was about $188,200, while the median net worth of Black households was about $24,100, indicating a wealth gap of approximately 7.8 to 1.

During apartheid in South Africa, which lasted from 1948 to 1994, the government enforced strict racial segregation and discrimination against non-whites, including African South Africans. Research indicates that under apartheid, the wealth gap between whites and non-whites was also substantial but not quantitatively comparable to the current U.S. figures due to differences in economic systems and historical contexts. However, studies suggest that the wealth gap between whites and non-whites in South Africa during apartheid was around 15 to 1, according to some estimates.

Given these figures, the current U.S. wealth gap of approximately 7.8 to 1 is narrower than the estimated 15 to 1 wealth gap during apartheid in South Africa. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
945,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a member of the redistricting commission could accept a bribe and not be removed from the commission. This statement is generally false because redistricting commissions, like most government bodies, have rules and procedures for removing members who engage in misconduct, including accepting bribes. If a member accepts a bribe, they would likely face disciplinary action, which could include removal from the commission.

Answer: [0]"
946,"Explanation: The term ""Ponzi scheme"" refers to a fraudulent investment operation where new investors' money is used to pay earlier investors, creating the illusion of legitimate returns. This type of scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who operated such a scheme in the 1920s. Social Security, on the other hand, is a government program that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible individuals. It is funded through payroll taxes and dedicated trust funds, not through investments. The program is designed to be self-sustaining over the long term, with current workers paying into the system to support current retirees. While there have been debates about the sustainability of Social Security due to demographic changes and funding challenges, it does not operate as a Ponzi scheme.

Answer: [0]"
947,"Explanation: This claim is false. According to various reports from international organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the majority of Syrian refugees include women, children, and the elderly. While it is true that some young, able-bodied men have fled Syria seeking better opportunities, they do not represent the vast majority of the refugee population. The UNHCR data indicates that families, including women and children, make up a significant portion of Syrian refugees.

948,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as reports from military organizations, statements from officials, or data from food banks indicating that members of the guard have indeed resorted to using food banks. Without such concrete evidence, it is not possible to verify the claim. Additionally, the term ""our men and women of the Guard"" is quite broad and could refer to various types of military personnel, which might be served by different support systems.

949,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker's views on abortion are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times is false. Scott Walker, as a governor of Wisconsin, has been known for his conservative stance on various issues but his specific views on abortion have not been as restrictive as those of some Republican presidents. For instance, former President Donald Trump, who was a strong advocate for pro-life policies, signed into law the Mexico City Policy (also known as the Global Gag Rule) which restricted U.S. funding for international organizations that perform or provide counseling for abortion services. Additionally, former President George W. Bush also implemented similar policies. While Scott Walker did support certain restrictions on abortion, such as requiring parental consent for minors and banning partial-birth abortions, these measures were not as comprehensive or as widely implemented as those by presidential administrations.

950,"Explanation: This claim is partially accurate but also misleading. Under the original Paul Ryan Medicare proposal, there was a concern that private insurance plans could potentially deny coverage or drop individuals with pre-existing conditions. However, it's important to note that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) already includes protections against such practices through its essential health benefits requirement and prohibition on denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The Ryan proposal aimed to transition Medicare from a defined-benefit program to a defined-contribution program, which could have implications for how insurance companies operate within the Medicare system. But the specific claim about allowing insurance companies to deny coverage or drop individuals with pre-existing conditions is not entirely accurate without context.

Answer: [0]"
951,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical data of close elections in the United States where the margin was within 300 votes. While there have been several close elections, it's important to note that not all of them have been subject to recounts, and even fewer have resulted in a change due to a recount. The claim specifically mentions ""this century,"" which would be from 2000 onwards. In recent U.S. history, there have been notable close elections such as the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, but the margin was much larger than 300 votes (approximately 537 votes). Other close elections like the 2018 Florida Senate race between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott had margins well under 300 votes, but no recounts were necessary or resulted in a change.

Given the limited number of close races with such narrow margins and the fact that not all of them have been subject to recounts, it is unlikely that three out of four such races have been overturned in a recount. This claim appears to be an overgeneralization or misrepresentation of the actual historical data.

Answer: [0]"
952,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific vaccination rates for Texas during the time periods mentioned. The claim states that when the individual came into office, the vaccination rate was 65 percent, and when they left, it was 95 percent, a significant increase within a short period. However, without access to reliable and official data sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or state health department reports, it's impossible to confirm these exact figures.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without accurate and verifiable data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim should be considered unverified and potentially false until confirmed by reliable sources."
953,"Explanation: This claim is false. While it may be true that Central Health, a public health district in Texas, provides abortion services using taxpayer dollars, it is not accurate to say that it is the only hospital district in Texas doing so. Many other public health districts and hospitals in Texas also provide abortion services with public funds, as long as they comply with state laws and regulations. The Texas Legislature has passed laws regulating abortion services, but these do not prevent public health districts from providing them.

Answer: [0]"
954,"Explanation: The claim ""On restoring voting rights to non-violent felons"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. It does not specify a particular policy, country, or timeframe. In many places, there are indeed laws that restore voting rights to non-violent felons after they have served their time, but this varies widely by jurisdiction.

Answer: [0]"
955,"Explanation: The claim suggests that stories about a person's birth certificate somehow overshadowed the media coverage of the Republican and White House budget plans during a specific week in April. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether such a story would have had enough impact to dominate the news cycle for an entire week. Typically, major budget plans are significant news items and would likely receive extensive coverage. Additionally, without more context about which ""person"" is being referred to and what exactly the ""stories about his birth certificate"" entail, it's difficult to verify the claim.

Given the general nature of the claim and the lack of specific details, it seems unlikely that a single story about a birth certificate would have been the primary focus of media coverage for an entire week dedicated to budget plans. However, without concrete evidence or a specific reference point, we cannot definitively state that this claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
956,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of positions eliminated by Chesterfield's local government with the number of positions eliminated by the Commonwealth of Virginia's state government since fiscal year 2009. This would require access to detailed data on both the local and state government workforce reductions during that period. Without such data, it is impossible to make a definitive judgment about which entity has eliminated more positions.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without specific data on position eliminations for both Chesterfield and the Commonwealth of Virginia since fiscal year 2009."
957,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the amount of money spent by the Koch network in various Senate races across different states, including Ohio. Without such detailed and current information, it's impossible to confirm whether the Koch network is spending more money in the Ohio Senate race compared to other states. The claim lacks concrete evidence to support it.

Answer: 0"
958,"Explanation: In the United States, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) generally requires the government to obtain a warrant to access the contents of emails stored by providers for 180 days or more. However, the Stored Communications Act (SCA) under the ECPA allows the government to access older emails without a warrant under certain circumstances, such as when there is a national security concern or when the provider has voluntarily disclosed the information to the government. Additionally, the Supreme Court case Riley v. California (2014) and Carpenter v. United States (2018) have reinforced that digital privacy rights are protected under the Fourth Amendment, which generally requires a warrant for searches and seizures.

Answer: 0"
959,"Explanation: This claim is false because it oversimplifies and generalizes a complex issue. Poverty is not determined by gender alone but by a combination of factors including income, education, employment opportunities, and social policies. While women may be disproportionately affected by poverty due to various socio-economic factors such as gender pay gaps, discrimination, and caregiving responsibilities, it is inaccurate to state that the poorest in any country are exclusively women.

Answer: [0]"
960,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Dow Chemical chose to build a plant in Saudi Arabia instead of Oklahoma because of environmental regulations affecting the supply of natural gas. However, there is no widely reported information or official statement from Dow Chemical indicating such a decision was made specifically due to environmental regulations in the U.S. versus Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the primary reason for choosing a location for a chemical plant would typically be related to factors such as proximity to markets, availability and cost of raw materials, labor costs, and tax incentives rather than just environmental regulations.

Answer: 0"
961,"Explanation: This claim is highly questionable and requires verification from reliable sources. To date, there have been no official reports or findings by credible institutions that confirm such an action by the head of the IRS. Claims of erasing emails without proper authorization would be a serious matter and would likely be reported by multiple news outlets and government bodies. Without concrete evidence or a formal investigation confirming these allegations, it cannot be considered true.

Answer: [0]"
962,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the city of Newark regarding its school budget and the amount allocated from local property taxes. Without access to the most recent and accurate financial reports from the Newark Public Schools or the City of Newark, it's impossible to verify the exact percentage being paid from local property taxes. However, according to the New Jersey Department of Education, the average property tax contribution to school budgets in New Jersey is around 45-50%, which is significantly lower than the 80% claimed in the statement. This discrepancy suggests that the claim might be exaggerated or incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
963,"Explanation: The claim that ""in every state, women are paid less than men"" is false. This statement does not hold true across all states because there are several states where women's pay is equal to or higher than men's pay. Pay disparities vary significantly by state and occupation. For example, some states have implemented laws that require equal pay for equal work, which can lead to more equitable pay practices.

Answer: [0]"
964,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at whether Newt Gingrich has indeed made such a statement. After reviewing historical records and statements from Newt Gingrich, there is no evidence to suggest that he has publicly advocated for making the 11 million illegal workers in the United States legal. Instead, Gingrich has generally supported enforcement of immigration laws and has not called for legalization of undocumented immigrants.

Answer: 0"
965,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama 'only wants your children to have health insurance'"" is misleading and overly simplistic. While it is true that President Barack Obama's administration worked to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which aimed to increase access to health insurance, particularly for children, the ACA had a broader scope than just providing health insurance to children. It sought to expand coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, improve the quality of health care, and control costs. Therefore, attributing the entire goal of the ACA to ""only"" wanting children to have health insurance is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of the law's objectives.

Answer: [0]"
966,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Josh Mandel's public statements and voting records during the time when the U.S. government provided loans to the auto industry. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which included the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), was passed to provide financial assistance to various industries, including the automotive sector. Josh Mandel, who was a member of Congress at that time, voted against the TARP bill. This vote indicates that he opposed the federal loans to the auto industry.

Answer: 1"
967,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a loophole in gun laws that allows domestic abusers who have been convicted to bypass background checks and purchase guns at gun shows. This is generally true. In the United States, individuals who have been convicted of a felony, including domestic violence-related offenses, are prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. However, prior to the passage of the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA) in 1986, there was indeed a loophole where individuals could avoid background checks by purchasing firearms at gun shows. FOPA closed this loophole by requiring all firearms dealers, including those at gun shows, to conduct background checks before selling firearms.

Answer: 1"
968,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the data available on the economic impact of high-speed rail projects. High-speed rail projects have been shown to create significant numbers of jobs during their construction phase, often in the thousands. However, the exact number of jobs created can vary widely depending on factors such as the length of the project, the cost, and the local economy.

While it is plausible that a high-speed rail project could create more than 60,000 jobs, this specific number would require detailed economic modeling and analysis based on the specifics of the proposed project in Florida. Without such detailed information, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence regarding the specific high-speed rail project in question. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim cannot be confirmed as true."
969,"Explanation: The claim ""Today almost half our debt is owned by foreigners"" is too vague without specifying which country's debt is being referred to. However, for the sake of analysis, we can consider the U.S. national debt as a common reference point. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as of recent data, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities have been around 35-40% of the total debt. This figure has fluctuated over time but generally does not reach the ""almost half"" threshold.

Answer: 0"
970,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if there were any Republican members of Congress who voted against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. Without specific context about which bill or resolution this refers to, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, historically, there have been instances where individual Republicans have voted against such measures, especially if they disagreed with the scope or intent of the investigation.

To confirm the accuracy of this statement, one would need to check the voting records of all Republican members of the relevant House committee during the time period when this vote occurred. If it can be shown that at least one Republican indeed voted against the creation of the panel, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if no Republican voted against it, or if all Republicans supported the measure, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: The answer is 0 because without specific context and verified data, we cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false. The claim could be true if at least one Republican voted against the panel, but we lack the necessary information to confirm this.)"
971,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has a track record of not raising taxes"" is vague without context. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about who ""he"" is, over what period of time, and in which jurisdiction. Without these details, it's impossible to verify whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
972,"Explanation: The claim ""Were No. 1 in child hunger"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to determine its accuracy. To properly evaluate this statement, we would need to know which country or entity is being referred to as ""We."" Additionally, the claim should specify a time period or context for comparison.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be evaluated as true or false without more information. Therefore, it is considered false due to insufficient data."
973,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is evidence that Glenn Hegar, who was the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts from 2003 to 2015, expressed pride in legislated cuts to public school funding. Without specific statements or actions from Hegar indicating pride in such cuts, it would be inaccurate to assert he expressed pride in them. Additionally, if such cuts were made during his tenure as Comptroller, it would be more accurate to attribute any pride to the legislators who passed the legislation rather than to Hegar himself.

Answer: [0]"
974,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical evidence or official documentation suggesting that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas for rebuilding Gaza. In fact, the U.S. government has consistently maintained a policy of not recognizing Hamas as a legitimate political entity due to its designation as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. Department of State. Any aid provided by the U.S. to the Palestinian territories has been channeled through the Palestinian Authority and other non-military means.

Answer: [0]"
975,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context and evidence regarding Scott Walker's actions related to voting and DMV offices. In 2011, Scott Walker did implement a law that closed many DMV offices across Wisconsin, which were often located in areas with higher concentrations of low-income voters. The rationale behind this was to reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, critics argued that it made voting more difficult for low-income individuals who lacked transportation or had limited time off work to visit a DMV office.

Several studies and reports have examined the impact of these closures. For instance, a report from the Government Accountability Project found that the closures disproportionately affected low-income communities and people of color, making it harder for them to access voter registration services. Additionally, there have been legal challenges and ongoing debates about the impact of these changes on voter accessibility.

Answer: 1

The claim is supported by evidence showing that the closure of DMV offices in areas with high concentrations of low-income voters has made voting more difficult for those individuals."
976,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the only alternatives to increasing state worker pension and healthcare payments are either laying off 1,500 state workers or removing 200,000 children from Medicaid-related programs. This statement is overly simplistic and does not account for other potential solutions such as reducing administrative costs, increasing revenue through taxation, reallocating funds from other state budgets, or implementing cost-saving measures in non-essential areas. Additionally, the numbers provided do not specify a context or timeframe, making it difficult to verify their accuracy.

Answer: 0"
977,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the number of public employees is lower than what is commonly believed and that the country is below average in terms of the number of public employees. To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the actual number of public employees in the country against both its own historical data and the average number of public employees in other countries.

Without specific data points or a reference to which country this statement is about, it's difficult to verify the claim. However, generally speaking, the United States, for example, has a relatively high number of public employees compared to some other developed nations. According to recent data from the International Civil Service Commission, the U.S. has a higher percentage of public sector employment compared to countries like Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be false based on available data, as the U.S., for instance, typically has a higher number of public employees compared to many other developed nations."
978,"Explanation: The claim that the Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America is true. According to various reports, the Walton family controls a significant portion of the wealth generated by Walmart, which is one of the largest retail companies in the world. As of recent data, the Waltons' combined net worth is estimated to be over $200 billion. In contrast, the bottom 40 percent of Americans, who represent about 120 million people, have a combined net worth that is significantly lower. This disparity in wealth distribution has been well-documented by economic studies and reports from reputable sources such as Forbes and Oxfam.

Answer: 1"
979,"Explanation: The claim ""On high-speed rail"" is incomplete and does not provide a specific statement to evaluate. It lacks context or a specific assertion about high-speed rail that could be judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
980,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the list of government programs targeted for elimination or severe cutback in the House Republican spending plans with the list of government programs at high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse as identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). If none of the programs targeted by the House Republicans appear on the GAO's list, then the claim would be true. However, if even one program from the House Republican list appears on the GAO's list, the claim would be false.

Without specific details about both lists, it's impossible to definitively verify the claim. The claim could be true if the House Republican list does not overlap with the GAO's list, but it could also be false if there is any overlap.

Answer: 0

The answer is 0 because the claim cannot be verified without additional information about the specific programs listed by the House Republicans and the GAO. Therefore, we cannot confirm that none of the programs targeted by the House Republicans were on the GAO's list."
981,"Explanation: The claim contains several false and misleading statements about Hillary Clinton's views and beliefs. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. There is no credible evidence that Hillary Clinton has stated she would ""wipe out"" the Second Amendment. In fact, during her campaign, Clinton supported a ban on assault weapons and universal background checks, but she did not advocate for eliminating the Second Amendment entirely.

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedoms of speech, religion, press, assembly, and petition. While Clinton had her own opinions and positions on various issues, there is no evidence that she does not believe in the First Amendment. Clinton was known for her support of free speech and the press.

Regarding the Tenth Amendment, it states that powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Clinton generally supported a balance between federal and state powers, but she also believed in the importance of a strong federal government to address national issues such as healthcare, education, and economic policies. This belief does not necessarily contradict the Tenth Amendment; rather, it reflects a common debate over the appropriate distribution of power between federal and state governments.

Answer: [0]"
982,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records of elections in the relevant state and any official investigations into voter fraud during that time. Without specific details about the state and year of the election, it's challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, if there were no official reports or findings of significant voter fraud in that particular election, the claim would be false. Additionally, if there was credible evidence of voter fraud that contributed to the outcome, the claim could be true.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer assumes that without specific evidence or records indicating voter fraud in the election between John Lehman and Van Wanggaard, the claim cannot be verified as true. If there were documented cases of voter fraud that influenced the outcome, the answer would be 1.)"
983,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia's illegal immigration crackdown laws should be called the ""Brown Codes"" because of their similarity to the Black Codes governing African Americans after the Civil War is a matter of historical and legal comparison. The Black Codes, enacted by Southern states after the Civil War, were designed to restrict the freedom and rights of newly freed African Americans and maintain white supremacy. They often included provisions that limited voting rights, labor conditions, and social interactions.

Georgia's current immigration laws, on the other hand, are modern statutes aimed at regulating and enforcing federal immigration laws. While they may include measures such as penalties for employers who hire undocumented immigrants, they do not inherently carry the same racial restrictions or intent to maintain a system of racial hierarchy as the Black Codes did.

The term ""Brown Codes"" does not have a recognized historical or legal context. It appears to be a hypothetical or metaphorical comparison rather than a historically accurate term. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and mischaracterization of both the historical context and the nature of modern immigration laws.

Answer: [0]"
984,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify if incoming House Speaker Dean Cannon and incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos have publicly stated their intention to support legislation allowing oil drilling off Florida's coast during the next legislative session. Without specific statements from these individuals or official records confirming such intentions, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without concrete evidence of public statements or official announcements from Dean Cannon and Mike Haridopolos regarding their plans for the next legislative session."
985,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the individual did not mean to refer to the Islamic State when making a comment about extremists being a ""JV"" (junior varsity) team. However, without additional context or information about who made this statement and the specific circumstances surrounding it, it's difficult to definitively verify whether the statement was intended to refer to a specific group of extremists or not. If we assume that the statement was made in a general sense about various extremist groups and not specifically about the Islamic State, then the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if the statement was clearly made with the intent to refer to the Islamic State, then the claim would be false.

Answer: [0]"
986,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update, many states in the United States have enacted laws aimed at promoting equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender. Texas, like several other states, has its own equal pay laws. For example, Texas Labor Code §21.251 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex with respect to compensation. Additionally, the federal Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act also apply in Texas, providing further protections against pay discrimination. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that Texas is one of only a handful of states without such laws.

Answer: [0]"
987,"Explanation: The claim that ""by 2009, dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield by drones"" is partially true but requires context. Drones were indeed used as a tool for targeted killings of high-value terrorist targets starting around 2007-2008, with significant operations in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and elsewhere. By 2009, there were notable instances where senior leaders of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban were killed using drone strikes. However, the exact number of ""dozens"" is difficult to quantify precisely without specific data from the time period.

Answer: 1

The claim is true in the sense that senior terrorists were being targeted and killed by drone strikes by 2009, but the exact number of ""dozens"" is not definitively verifiable with the information provided."
988,"Explanation: The claim contains several elements that need to be evaluated separately. First, it mentions that Tommy Thompson ""favors"" Obama's healthcare mandate. Second, it states that Obama publicly thanked Thompson for his support in health reform. Lastly, it claims that Thompson says ""we can't repeal Obamacare."" 

To verify these statements, we would need to look at historical records and public statements from both Tommy Thompson and Barack Obama. Without specific references or verifiable sources, it's difficult to confirm or deny each part of the claim.

However, based on known facts, Tommy Thompson was a Republican politician who generally opposed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is commonly referred to as Obamacare. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would have been publicly thanked by Obama for supporting the ACA. Additionally, Thompson has been vocal about his opposition to the ACA and has advocated for its repeal.

Answer: [0]"
989,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the current faculty salaries at the University of Wisconsin (UW) System institutions with the national average for faculty salaries. This requires access to recent and reliable data sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) or similar educational research organizations that track salary trends in higher education.

Without specific data from a credible source, it's impossible to confirm whether faculty salaries at UW System institutions have indeed fallen by more than 18 percent below the national average. The claim could be true if the data shows a significant gap, but without such data, the claim cannot be verified.

Answer: 0"
990,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not specify which debate schedule or candidates it refers to. In reality, the Democratic Party does not create debate schedules; that responsibility typically falls under the auspices of independent organizations such as the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) in the United States. These organizations aim to ensure fair and equal opportunities for candidates to participate in debates. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: [0]"
991,"Explanation: The claim states that the federal government now consumes 25% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) compared to historically being at 20%, implying a reduction of 5 percentage points from the private sector. However, this statement is misleading because it does not specify what ""consume"" means in this context. Typically, when discussing government consumption of GDP, it refers to government spending rather than taking money away from the private sector.

In reality, the federal government's spending as a percentage of GDP has fluctuated over time due to various economic policies and conditions. For example, during times of economic crisis or significant public investment (like during World War II or the Great Depression), government spending might increase as a percentage of GDP. Conversely, during periods of economic growth and fiscal discipline, government spending might decrease as a percentage of GDP. This does not necessarily mean that the government is taking money away from the private sector; it simply reflects the balance between government spending and overall economic activity.

Answer: [0]"
992,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the accuracy of the statement about spending, the nature of the calls, and the context in which they were made. The term ""robocall"" typically refers to pre-recorded automated phone calls that can be used for various purposes, such as political campaigning, public health announcements, or debt collection. Without specific evidence or a verified source indicating that Governor Rick Scott's office was using automated calls for an inappropriate or illegal purpose, it would be premature to conclude that these calls were ""robocalls"" in the sense of being illegal or unethical.

The claim also does not specify what the calls were about or how they were used. If the calls were part of a legitimate campaign strategy or informational outreach, then the claim would be false. Additionally, the claim does not provide a source or any details about the spending, making it difficult to verify the exact amount of money spent.

Answer: 0"
993,"Explanation: The claim that South Florida has experienced nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s needs to be evaluated with current scientific data. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average global sea level rose about 8-9 inches in the last century. However, regional variations can differ due to local factors such as land subsidence and ocean currents. For South Florida specifically, studies indicate a higher rate of sea-level rise compared to the global average, but the exact amount would need to be referenced from recent scientific reports or studies.

A study published by the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science found that South Florida has experienced a significant increase in sea levels, with some areas experiencing rises of up to 10 inches over the past century. This aligns closely with the claim of nine inches since the 1920s.

Answer: 1"
994,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at whether Mitt Romney indeed had a corporation in Bermuda and whether he failed to disclose it on his financial disclosures. According to public records and investigations, Mitt Romney did have a company called Romney Holdings Limited in Bermuda. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) require disclosure of foreign entities only when they hold assets or have significant business activities. In Romney's case, the company held no assets and was not involved in any significant business activities, so there was no requirement for him to disclose it on his financial filings as a candidate for president. Therefore, while Romney did have a company in Bermuda, he was not required to disclose it on his financial disclosures.

Answer: 0"
995,"Explanation: The claim is true. Numerous studies have shown that frequent hand washing and covering your mouth when you cough can significantly reduce the transmission of influenza (flu) and other respiratory illnesses. Hand washing removes viruses from the skin, while covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing prevents larger droplets containing the virus from spreading into the air and onto surfaces where others might touch them.

Answer: [1]"
996,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the president of the United States visited a ward where they received 99% of the vote in the previous election, but the number of votes did not increase during the current election. This statement is vague and lacks specific details such as the name of the president, the state, and the exact dates of the elections. However, it is plausible that in some cases, a high percentage of votes in a particular area does not necessarily mean an increase in votes during the next election due to various factors like voter turnout, changes in the electorate, or other political dynamics.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context and specific data about the exact election and location being referred to. Therefore, we cannot confirm its accuracy and must assume it is false until proven otherwise."
997,"Explanation: The claim ""We gave every public employee in the state the freedom to choose whether or not they want to be in a union"" is likely false because it implies that every public employee has been given the right to opt out of union membership, which is not a common practice in many states. Typically, public sector unions operate under collective bargaining agreements where union membership is mandatory for certain benefits and protections, and opting out may have consequences such as losing these benefits.

Answer: [0]"
998,"Explanation: The claim states that a proposal to boost the teacher pension fund puts no mandate on local government. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether the proposal explicitly requires or imposes any obligations on local governments regarding funding or contributions to the teacher pension fund. If the proposal does not include such requirements, then the claim would be true. However, if the proposal includes any form of mandate or requirement for local governments to contribute or take action, then the claim would be false.

Answer: [0 or 1]

To determine the correct answer, we would need more specific information about the content of the proposal in question. Without this context, it's impossible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false. Therefore, based on the given information alone, I cannot provide a definitive answer of 0 or 1. If you could provide additional details about the proposal, I could give a more accurate assessment."
999,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a conspiracy theory and lacks credible evidence to support it. There is no verifiable record or documentation that Hillary Clinton laughed at a victim of rape, nor any evidence that she helped a man accused of such an act.
