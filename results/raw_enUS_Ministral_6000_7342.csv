Without additional context or verification, it is difficult to determine the authenticity of this claim.

3,"Explanation: The claim that nearly all of the top 50 prescribers of oxycodone in the United States are in Florida is likely false. While Florida has been known to have a high rate of opioid prescriptions, it is not accurate to say that nearly all of the top 50 prescribers are located there. The distribution of top prescribers is likely more widespread across the country, with significant concentrations in other states as well.

Answer: 0"

5,"Explanation: The claim is false. After the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015, the White House did not make a statement that ISIS could not reach the United States. In fact, the U.S. government has been actively working to prevent and respond to potential terrorist threats, including those from ISIS. The claim is a misrepresentation of the actual events and statements made by the White House.

Answer: 0"
6,"Explanation: The claim that the pension system was funded at 100% in 2001 and 2002 is false. The funding level of the pension system is typically expressed as a percentage of the total pension liabilities that are covered by the system's assets. In 2001 and 2002, the funding level of the U.S. Social Security system was not at 100%. According to the Social Security Administration, the funding level was around 90% in 2001 and 2002.

This plan aimed to provide health insurance to all Massachusetts residents. However, the claim that this health care plan is now bankrupting the state of Massachusetts is false. While there have been challenges and criticisms of the plan, it has not led to the state's financial collapse. The claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
8,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement from the U.S. Treasury Department's report on the U.S. Debt to the Public. According to the report, as of December 31, 2021, the U.S. had a public debt of $28.4 trillion. The claim states that $1.4 trillion was borrowed, which is not accurate as the total public debt is much higher. Additionally, the claim that ""over half of this debt is held by foreign investors"" is not supported by the data provided in the report. The report shows that as of December 31, 2021, foreign investors held $6.3 trillion of the U.S. public debt, which is approximately 22% of the total public debt.

Therefore, the claim that he voted against it is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
13,"Explanation: The claim that the government wants to require farm tractor drivers to hold commercial drivers licenses even if they're just crossing a single public road is false. In the United States, for example, farm tractors are generally exempt from commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements, as they are not considered commercial vehicles. The CDL requirements typically apply to vehicles used for commercial purposes, such as transporting goods or passengers for hire. Farm tractors are primarily used for agricultural purposes and are not subject to the same regulations as commercial vehicles.

Answer: 0"
14,"Explanation: The claim about 6,200 election-day registrations from 2008 in Minnesota being fraudulent is false.

16,"Explanation: A balanced budget amendment is a proposal to require the federal government to balance its budget each year. This means that the government would not be allowed to spend more money than it collects in revenue. The idea behind this amendment is to prevent the government from running large deficits and accumulating significant debt. However, the claim itself is not a statement of fact but rather a description of a policy proposal. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false in the context of a news claim.

18,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate and has proposed policies that would reduce funding for Planned Parenthood. During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney stated that he would not require employers to cover contraception and has since advocated for policies that would defund Planned Parenthood. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
19,"Explanation: The claim states that there have been 30 published polls in this election cycle and Harry Reid has been trailing in every single one.

Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively proven true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
20,"Explanation: Historically, Senate ratification of arms control treaties has often been bipartisan, with significant support from both Democratic and Republican senators. This bipartisan support is often driven by the shared interest in maintaining international stability and preventing nuclear proliferation. However, it is not always the case, and there have been instances where the ratification process has been more contentious and less bipartisan. Therefore, while the claim is generally true, it is not universally applicable.

Answer: 1"
21,"Explanation: The claim that Aaron Bean voted to give health care subsidies to illegal immigrants is false.

Bean has not voted on any legislation that specifically targets illegal immigrants for health care subsidies.

Answer: 0"
22,"Explanation: The claim that a rainy day fund has gone from 89 cents to $240 million is highly unlikely and implausible. A rainy day fund is typically a reserve fund set aside for unexpected expenses or emergencies, and it is not common for such a fund to increase by such a large amount in a short period. The claim seems to be an exaggeration or a misrepresentation of the actual amount.

Answer: 0"
23,"Explanation: The claim that the 2009-11 state budget approved by Democrats left Wisconsin taxpayers $3.6 billion in debt is false. The 2009-11 budget was approved by a bipartisan group of legislators, including Republicans, and the debt figure of $3.6 billion is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
27,"Explanation: The claim states that the first eight chosen to draw Austin City Council districts are seven Democratic primary voters and one Republican primary voter. This claim is specific and verifiable. If the claim is true, it would mean that the process of selecting the individuals to draw the districts was biased towards Democratic voters. However, without specific evidence or official records, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
28,"Explanation: The claim is a metaphorical statement that uses ""gas-guzzling dinosaurs"" to refer to older, less fuel-efficient vehicles. It is not a literal claim about a person's past actions. Therefore, it cannot be objectively verified as true or false.

Answer: 0"
29,"Explanation: The claim that job creation has gotten worse each year that Scott Walker has been governor is a generalization that can be misleading. Job creation can vary significantly from year to year due to numerous factors such as economic cycles, industry-specific trends, and national economic conditions. While it is true that job creation can fluctuate, it is not accurate to say that it has consistently gotten worse each year during Walker's tenure as governor. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
30,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Pentagon is indeed exempt from the federal law that requires all federal agencies to complete annual audits. This exemption is due to the complexity and size of the Pentagon's operations, which make it difficult to conduct a comprehensive audit. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has acknowledged this exemption and has not required the Pentagon to conduct an annual audit.

Answer: 1"
31,"Explanation: The claim that we now have the greatest income inequality since the Great Depression is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources. According to these data, the income inequality in the United States has been increasing since the 1970s, with the top 1% of earners capturing a larger share of the total income. However, it is important to note that the Great Depression was a unique historical event with extreme economic conditions, and comparing current income inequality to that period requires careful consideration of the context and data sources.

Answer: 1"
32,"Explanation: The claim that former U.S. President Barack Obama called Israel ""a constant sore"" that infects U.S. foreign policy is false.

Answer: 0"
33,"Explanation: The claim is false. Nevada lawmakers did not vote to allow teenaged boys to shower with teenaged girls in public school locker rooms. This misinformation has been circulating due to a misunderstanding of a bill that was introduced in 2019, which aimed to protect transgender students from discrimination. The bill did not allow boys to shower with girls, but rather aimed to ensure that transgender students could use the locker rooms that correspond to their gender identity. The bill was not passed and did not become law.

Answer: 0"
34,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls is false. In 2018, Florida's Secretary of State, Ken Detzner, announced that 180,000 voters had been removed from the rolls due to a lack of recent voting activity. This was a routine process to maintain the accuracy of the voter rolls, not an attempt by Gov. Rick Scott to remove voters. The claim incorrectly attributes this action to Scott.

Answer: 0"
35,"Explanation: The claim about a 35 to 51 percent drop in crime rates in some Atlanta neighborhoods can be true or false depending on the specific neighborhoods and time periods being referenced. To accurately evaluate this claim, one would need to refer to official crime statistics from reliable sources such as the Atlanta Police Department or the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program.

Answer: 0/1"
36,"Explanation: The claim about abortion is a complex issue that involves legal, ethical, and medical aspects.

Answer: 0"
40,"Explanation: The claim that Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz opposes the DREAM Act is true. Ted Cruz has publicly stated his opposition to the DREAM Act, which is a bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. According to a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center, 85% of Latinos support the DREAM Act. Therefore, the claim that Cruz opposes the DREAM Act is accurate.

Answer: 1"
41,"Explanation: The claim ""I am a candidate. I have not withdrawn"" is a statement that can be true or false depending on the context.

Answer: 1/0 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
42,"Explanation: The claim that the majority support raising the minimum wage is generally true. According to various polls and surveys, a significant portion of the public supports increasing the minimum wage. For instance, a 2021 Gallup poll found that 68% of Americans support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Similarly, a 2020 Pew Research Center survey showed that 61% of Americans favor increasing the minimum wage. These figures indicate that a majority of the public supports raising the minimum wage.

Answer: 1"
43,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did propose several measures that would have changed the tax situation of Warren Buffett and his secretary.

Answer: 0"
44,"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare is false. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to expand health insurance coverage, not reduce it. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the number of uninsured Floridians decreased from 2.5 million in 2013 to 1.3 million in 2019, which is a significant reduction. The claim of 300,000 Floridians losing their health insurance is not supported by reliable data.

Answer: 0"
45,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account is false. This claim was made during the 2012 U.S. presidential election, but it was later proven to be false. Romney's campaign released his tax returns, which showed that he had no money in Swiss bank accounts. The claim was based on a false document that was later exposed as a forgery.

Answer: 0"
46,"Explanation: The claim is comparing per capita healthcare spending between the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other reliable sources, the United States spends significantly more on healthcare per capita than both the United Kingdom and France. The U.S. spends around $10,966 per capita, while the U.K. spends around $4,900 and France spends around $5,500. This means the U.S. spends approximately 2.2 times more than the U.K. and about 1.03 times more than France, which is slightly more than 50% more than France.

Answer: 1"
47,"Explanation: The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act is a proposed law that would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The claim that the DREAM Act would give amnesty to over two million illegal aliens is an exaggeration. The DREAM Act would only apply to a subset of undocumented immigrants who meet specific criteria, such as having arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16 and having lived in the country continuously since that time. The exact number of beneficiaries is difficult to determine, but it is not accurate to say that it would apply to over two million people.

Answer: 0"
48,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt"" is misleading. The U.S. federal government has not balanced its budget since 2001, and the debt has been increasing. The debt has grown from $5.6 trillion in 2001 to over $28 trillion in 2021. The claim does not specify which administration or period is being referred to, but the overall statement is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
49,"Explanation: The claim that the measles vaccine does not cause autism is supported by extensive scientific research and consensus among the medical and scientific communities. Multiple studies have investigated the potential link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism, and none have found a causal relationship. The most famous study that initially suggested a link, published by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, was later retracted due to serious procedural errors, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, and ethical violations. The overwhelming consensus among scientists and health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.

Answer: 1"
50,"Explanation: A tax on soda and juice drinks would indeed disproportionately affect low-income families in Philadelphia. This is because low-income families often rely more heavily on these beverages as part of their daily caloric intake, and a tax would increase their overall expenditure on food and drinks. Additionally, low-income families may not have access to healthier alternatives or may not be able to afford them, making the tax more burdensome for them.

Answer: 1"
51,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that a citizen with a gun stopped the Clackamas Town Center shooting in 2012, Kip Kinkel's shooting at Thurston High School in 1998 was not stopped by a citizen with a gun. In fact, Kinkel was stopped by police officers after he had already killed two students and wounded 22 others. The claim incorrectly suggests that a citizen with a gun stopped both incidents.

Answer: 0"
52,"Explanation: The claim that ""not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police in New York in about 45 years"" is false. There have been numerous instances of unarmed white individuals being shot by police in New York over the past several decades. For example, in 2014, Eric Garner was killed by a New York City police officer after being placed in a chokehold. In 2016, Akai Gurley was shot and killed by a police officer in Brooklyn. These are just a couple of examples, and there are many more documented cases.

Answer: 0"
53,"Explanation: The claim that the Georgia Secretary of State's Office and the Georgia State Elections Board investigate and penalize hundreds of people guilty of election fraud is not accurate. While there have been investigations and allegations of election fraud in Georgia, the number of people penalized is not in the hundreds. The Georgia Secretary of State's Office has reported that they have found no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and the Georgia State Elections Board has not reported any significant penalties for election fraud.

Answer: 0"
54,"Explanation: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Oregon does not lead the nation in the number of jobs per capita in manufacturing.

Answer: 0"
55,"Explanation: The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) does indeed place the responsibility for cleanup and containment of oil spills primarily on the party responsible for the spill. This is often referred to as the ""polluter pays"" principle. The act requires the responsible party to take immediate action to prevent or minimize the discharge of oil and to provide for the cleanup of the oil. The Obama administration, like any other administration, would be bound by this law. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
56,"Explanation: FirstEnergys annual revenues are not greater than the GDP of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, or 15 African nations. The GDP of these countries and the revenues of FirstEnergy are not comparable in the same context. FirstEnergy is a U.S.-based electric utility company, while the GDP figures are for entire countries. The GDP of these countries is a measure of their total economic output, while FirstEnergy's revenues are a measure of its business performance. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
57,"Explanation: The Libertarian Party is not the third-largest political party in the U.S. According to the latest data from the Federal Election Commission, the Libertarian Party is the third-largest party in terms of registered voters, but it is not the third-largest in terms of elected officials or political influence. The two largest parties in terms of elected officials and political influence are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.

Answer: 0"
59,"Explanation: The claim that all legislative mail, from the content to the timing, is approved by the speaker's office is not entirely accurate. While the speaker's office may have some oversight or influence over legislative mail, it is not accurate to say that all aspects of it are approved by the speaker's office. The content and timing of legislative mail can be influenced by various factors, including the legislative agenda, the priorities of the speaker, and the input of other legislators and staff.

Answer: 0"
60,"Explanation: The claim that ""above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth"" is not accurate. According to various studies and reports, the number of Muslims who are radicalized or extremist is a small fraction of the global Muslim population. For instance, a 2019 Pew Research Center report estimated that about 13% of Muslims worldwide hold extremist views, which translates to around 200 million people. This is significantly less than the 800 million figure stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim that more than half of Muslims are radicalized is false.

Answer: 0"
61,"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplistic assumption that freezing spending at 2007 levels would automatically balance the budget and cut the national debt in half by 2020. However, this ignores several factors:
1. **Economic Growth**: The economy grows over time, and spending needs to grow with it to maintain services and infrastructure.
2. **Inflation**: Prices increase over time, so the value of money decreases. Therefore, spending needs to increase to maintain the same level of services.
3. **Demographic Changes**: Population growth and aging can increase spending on social services.
4. **Economic Downturns**: Economic crises, like the 2008 financial crisis, can lead to increased spending to stimulate the economy.

Given these factors, freezing spending at 2007 levels would not balance the budget or cut the national debt in half by 2020. The claim is therefore false.

Trump Foundation is a non-profit organization, and its funds are not owned by Donald Trump personally.

The foundation's assets are not considered to be Donald Trump's personal assets.

Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
67,"Explanation: The claim that the Republicans voted last year to end Medicare is false. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, and it is funded by taxes and premiums. There have been discussions and proposals to reform Medicare, but no significant legislation has been passed to end the program. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of ongoing debates about Medicare's future.

Answer: 0"
68,"Explanation: The claim that Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel under Hosni Mubarak's rule is not accurate. While Egypt did receive significant financial aid from the United States during Mubarak's rule, it is not accurate to say that it received more than any other country besides Israel. The United States provided substantial aid to many countries, including Egypt, but the claim that Egypt received more than any other country besides Israel is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
69,"Explanation: The claim states that a typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month if the library district passes. However, without specific details about the library district's budget, the proposed tax increase, and the average homeowner's property value, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim. The claim is vague and lacks sufficient information to determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
70,"Explanation: The claim that ""Probably less than 4 percent of Wisconsin residents are enjoying the subsidies from Obamacare"" is difficult to verify without specific data. However, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of 2021, approximately 11% of Wisconsin residents were enrolled in the Medicaid expansion program, which is a part of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This suggests that the claim is likely an underestimation.

Answer: 0"
71,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every other democracy in the world has a health care system that covers everybody, and we don't"" is not entirely accurate. While many democracies do have universal healthcare systems, there are exceptions. For instance, the United States has a complex healthcare system that includes both public and private components, but it does not provide universal coverage. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
72,"Explanation: The claim that Tom Nelson backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million, is false. Tom Nelson, a former Wisconsin state senator, has been a vocal opponent of raising taxes on Social Security. He has consistently advocated for protecting Social Security benefits and has not supported any proposals that would increase taxes on Social Security recipients. The claim about a $95 million cost to Wisconsin seniors is not supported by any credible sources or evidence.

Answer: 0"
73,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the General Assembly's business was almost entirely completed by 11 PM, implying that the late-night session was not significant. However, this claim is not verifiable without specific sources or evidence. The percentage of business done by a certain time is not a standard metric reported in news articles about General Assembly sessions. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
74,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump always pays his bills promptly is not entirely accurate. While there have been instances where Trump has paid his bills on time, there have also been reports of delayed payments and even lawsuits related to unpaid bills. For example, Trump has been involved in several lawsuits over unpaid bills, including a $100 million lawsuit filed by a former business partner. Therefore, the claim that he always pays his bills promptly is an oversimplification and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
75,"Explanation: The claim is true. The most recent example of a Supreme Court nominee being confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate during an election year is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's confirmation in 1993.

Answer: 1"
76,"Explanation: The claim that more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners is an overgeneralization and an exaggeration. While intimate partner violence is a serious issue, the actual number of women who die from such violence is lower. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 43,000 women die each year from intimate partner violence, which translates to about 118 women per day. This number is significantly lower than the claim of more than three women per day.

Answer: 0"
77,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry and the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature managed to slash the budget of the volunteer fire departments in Texas by 75 percent in the last legislative session is false. While there have been budget cuts to various state agencies, including fire departments, the claim of a 75 percent reduction is an exaggeration. The actual cuts were more modest, and the state has been working to restore funding to these departments. Additionally, the claim that these cuts have reduced their abilities to fight recent wildfires is not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
78,"Explanation: Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, has indeed expressed his opposition to abortion, including in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother. He has supported legislation that would restrict abortion access, including a 2013 law that required women to undergo an ultrasound before having an abortion. However, it's important to note that Walker's views on abortion are part of a broader political stance and do not necessarily reflect a desire to make abortion illegal in all circumstances.

Answer: 0"
81,"Explanation: The claim that Medicaid has grown by 1,600 percent in the last 30 years in Virginia is misleading. While Medicaid enrollment has indeed increased significantly over time, a 1,600 percent growth rate is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicaid enrollment in Virginia has grown from approximately 1.2 million enrollees in 1990 to around 1.7 million enrollees in 2020. This represents a growth rate of about 42 percent, not 1,600 percent.

Answer: 0"
82,"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario where Proposition 1 is rejected. The cost of a new City-run criminal background check process would depend on various factors such as the scope of the checks, the number of people involved, and the efficiency of the process. While it's possible that such a process could incur significant costs, the claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that it would cost ""millions"" in processing fees, additional staff, and bureaucracy. Therefore, the claim is speculative and lacks concrete evidence.

85,"Explanation: Debo Adegbile was indeed nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by President Obama in 2013. However, his nomination was withdrawn by the Senate Judiciary Committee due to concerns about his role in a case involving the National Rifle Association (NRA). This withdrawal was not an abrupt action by the administration but rather a result of the Senate's review process.

Answer: 0"
86,"Explanation: The claim that the tax changes in January 2023 are ""OBAMA TAX HIKES"" is false. The tax changes in question are part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law by President Trump, not President Obama. Additionally, the claim that these tax changes will ""slam every American's savings, investments, and job opportunity"" is not supported by evidence. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was designed to provide tax relief to individuals and businesses, and its impact on savings, investments, and job opportunities has been a subject of ongoing debate and analysis.

Answer: 0"
89,"Explanation: The claim that ""Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax"" is based on a misinterpretation of a study by the Tax Policy Center. The study found that 47% of Americans do not pay federal income tax, but this does not mean they pay no tax at all. Many of these individuals are low-income earners who do not earn enough to owe federal income tax, but they may still pay other taxes such as payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare) or state and local taxes. Therefore, the claim is false.

91,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has stated that he believes in traditional marriage and has expressed opposition to same-sex marriage. However, he has not explicitly stated that he would deny gay people the right to adopt children. In fact, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, supported adoption rights for same-sex couples. Therefore, the claim that Romney would deny gay people the right to adopt children is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
92,"Explanation: The claim about the average Medicaid costs for people who had been homeless for a year or more in Rhode Island is not supported by any reliable sources. There is no specific study or data that supports this claim.

This is outlined in the U.S. Constitution and federal election laws.

Answer: 0"
95,"Explanation: The claim that baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws is false. While baseball has historically been exempt from antitrust laws due to a 1922 Supreme Court decision (Federated Press v. McLaughlin), insurance is not exempt. The insurance industry is subject to antitrust laws, and there have been several antitrust cases involving insurance companies. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
96,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does include provisions related to tort reform.

97,"Explanation: The claim that ""women care most about jobs and the economy"" is a generalization and not universally true. While economic stability and job security are important to many women, they also care about a wide range of issues such as education, healthcare, gender equality, and social justice. These concerns are not exclusive to women and are shared by many individuals regardless of gender. Therefore, the claim oversimplifies and stereotypes women's interests.

According to the New Jersey Office of the State Comptroller, the state's budget for the 2012 fiscal year was $30.7 billion, and the projected shortfall was approximately $1.2 billion, not $10.5 billion. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresents the actual budget situation.

Answer: 0"
101,"Explanation: The claim that approximately 70 percent of jobs created in the United States in November 2007-2008 were in Texas is not accurate.

Additionally, the claim does not provide a source or specific data to support the 70 percent figure.

Answer: 0"
102,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the average healthcare costs for private sector employees and city workers in Ohio. While it is possible to find specific data points that might support this claim, the statement itself is not a universally accepted or verifiable fact. Healthcare costs can vary greatly depending on the specific employer, the health insurance plan chosen, and other factors. Therefore, the claim is not universally true and lacks specific sources to back it up.

Answer: 0"
103,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, also known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission, did not produce a completely empty report. The commission, which was established by President Obama in 2010, released a report titled ""The Moment of Truth"" that included recommendations for reducing the federal deficit, including suggestions for controlling healthcare costs. The report proposed a variety of measures, such as reducing Medicare and Medicaid spending, increasing the eligibility age for Medicare, and implementing a value-based payment system for healthcare providers.

Answer: 0"
104,"Explanation: The claim that a new financial regulation ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks"" is false. Financial regulations are typically designed to prevent future crises and protect taxpayers from bearing the costs of bank failures. While there may be provisions for bank resolution or liquidation, these are not bailouts in the traditional sense, as they do not involve the government providing funds to banks to avoid failure. The claim misrepresents the purpose and effect of financial regulations.

106,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the voter turnout in Austin's 1973 mayoral election to the most recent mayoral election.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
111,"Explanation: The claim that the Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10 west of Houston, is the widest freeway in the world with up to 26 lanes, including frontage road lanes, is false. While the Katy Freeway is indeed one of the widest in the United States, it does not have 26 lanes. The maximum number of lanes on the Katy Freeway is 22, including frontage road lanes.

113,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Donald Trump allowed Moammar Gadhafi to set up an elaborate tent at his Westchester County estate. In fact, Gadhafi's visit to the United Nations in 1992 was a well-documented event, and he stayed at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, not at Trump's estate. Additionally, Trump was not in office during Gadhafi's visit.

Answer: 0"
114,"Explanation: The claim states that the unemployment rate has decreased by 2 percentage points in the last year. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in January 2022 was 3.8%, and in January 2021, it was 6.4%. This means the unemployment rate has indeed decreased by 2.6 percentage points, not 2. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

Additionally, the term ""ample"" is subjective and can be interpreted differently by different people.

Answer: 0"
117,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific event, the CNBC debate, and the nature of the questions asked. Without specific details about the debate and the questions asked, it's challenging to verify the claim. However, if the claim is that the questions were discredited attacks from Democrats and political opponents, it would require evidence to support this assertion. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
118,"Explanation: As of the latest data available, the total number of people employed in the United States is significantly higher than the total population of Canada. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. had approximately 160 million people employed in 2021. Meanwhile, the population of Canada is around 38 million. Therefore, the claim that there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada is false.

Answer: 0"
119,"Explanation: The claim that Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month is not accurate. The cost of living in Iraq varies greatly depending on the region, income level, and lifestyle. While some households may face financial burdens due to economic instability, it is not accurate to generalize that each household is costing $100 a month. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the economic situation in Iraq.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time data to verify this claim.

121,"Explanation: The claim that crime in Atlanta is down 18 percent since 2009 can be evaluated by checking reliable sources such as the Atlanta Police Department, FBI crime statistics, or reputable news outlets. According to the Atlanta Police Department's annual reports and FBI crime statistics, there has been a significant decrease in crime rates in Atlanta over the past decade. However, the exact percentage of decrease can vary depending on the specific type of crime and the time period considered. Therefore, the claim that crime is down by exactly 18 percent since 2009 is not verifiable with the information provided.

Answer: 0"
122,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama said the individual mandate was not a tax is false. In fact, during the debate over the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Obama repeatedly stated that the individual mandate was a tax. For example, in a 2009 interview with ABC News, he said, ""If you don't have health insurance, you're going to have to pay a penalty."" This penalty was later ruled a tax by the Supreme Court in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius.

Answer: 0"
125,"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget is a simplification of a complex political and economic situation. Ted Strickland served as the Governor of Ohio from 2007 to 2011. During his tenure, Ohio faced significant economic challenges, including the Great Recession. The budget cuts he implemented were part of efforts to address the state's fiscal crisis. While these cuts may have led to job losses in certain sectors, it is not accurate to attribute all job losses in Ohio to these specific budget cuts. The broader economic context, including national and global economic factors, also played a significant role in job losses during this period.

Answer: 0"
128,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not force businesses to drop coverage for their employees. Instead, it provides an option for businesses to choose between offering coverage to their employees or paying a penalty. Additionally, the ACA does not affect the 120 million Americans who are currently uninsured or those who are insured through Medicare or Medicaid. The claim is a misinterpretation of the ACA's provisions.

Answer: 0"
129,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, including Virginia, income tax rates are progressive, meaning that higher earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. The federal income tax system, as well as state systems like Virginia's, has different tax brackets with varying rates. For example, in Virginia, the top income tax rate is 5.75% for income over $12,000, while the lowest rate is 0% for income up to $12,000. Therefore, a cashier earning $20,000 per year would pay a lower tax rate than a hedge fund manager earning $20 million per year.

Answer: 0"
130,"Explanation: The claim that hydrogen sulfide was used in the genocide of Jews in Germany is false. Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas that can be used as a chemical weapon, but it was not used in the Holocaust.

The use of hydrogen sulfide in the Holocaust is a misconception that has been debunked by historical research.

For example, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had a background in law and politics, and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had a long career in the military and private sector. Therefore, the claim that 92 percent of his administration had never worked outside government is an exaggeration and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
134,"Explanation: The claim states that 56 percent of weekend voters in Cuyahoga County in 2008 were African American, while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population. This claim is false because it suggests a disproportionately high percentage of African American voters on weekends compared to their representation in the county's adult population. This is unlikely to be accurate as voter turnout is typically influenced by various factors such as accessibility, interest in the election, and other demographic factors, not just race.

Answer: 0"
135,"Explanation: The claim is false. The FBI does have the power to block terror suspects from purchasing firearms, explosives, and other dangerous items.

142,"Explanation: The claim that ""more than one-quarter of America's young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military"" is based on a study conducted by the RAND Corporation. The study found that approximately 26% of young adults aged 17-24 are too overweight to meet the military's physical fitness standards. This means they would not be able to pass the physical fitness test required for enlistment. Therefore, the claim is true.

According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the violent crime rate in California has been fluctuating but has not shown a significant increase of 34 percent in the last year. The FBI's data for 2020 and 2021 shows a decrease in violent crime rates in California, not an increase.

154,"Explanation: Georgia has indeed been known for its robust scholarship programs, including the HOPE Scholarship, which provides financial assistance to Georgia residents attending eligible postsecondary institutions. However, the claim that Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""richest."" Other states may have more comprehensive or higher-value scholarship programs. Therefore, while Georgia's scholarship programs are notable, it is not accurate to say that it has one of the richest programs without additional context.

Answer: 0"
155,"Explanation: The claim that the substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy prisons is false. Tax breaks and deductions are typically associated with personal income tax, not the purchase of prisons. Prisons are government-owned facilities, and their purchase or construction is not a private transaction that would qualify for tax incentives. Additionally, there is no evidence or official announcement from any government or authoritative source supporting this claim.

Answer: 0"
156,"Explanation: The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) does not rate senators or provide such rankings. The CDF is a non-profit organization that focuses on advocating for children's rights and well-being, but it does not publish or endorse any ratings or rankings of politicians. Therefore, the claim that the CDF rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children is false.

Answer: 0"
157,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not make the first speech to the nation's school children about persisting and succeeding in school. In fact, he delivered a speech to school children on September 8, 2009, which was not the first time a president had addressed school children. Previous presidents, including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, had also spoken to school children.

Answer: 0"
158,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did introduce significant consumer protections for insured Americans, such as the requirement for insurers to cover pre-existing conditions and provide essential health benefits. However, the claim that ""every uninsured American can become insured"" is not entirely accurate. While the ACA expanded access to health insurance, it did not guarantee that every uninsured American would become insured due to factors like income, eligibility for Medicaid, and personal choices. Some people may still remain uninsured due to these factors.

Answer: 0.5"
159,"Explanation: The claim is false. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as President Barack Obama's ""jobs bill,"" did not include provisions that allowed individuals to sue if they were unemployed and did not get a job. The bill focused on economic stimulus and job creation, but it did not provide a legal mechanism for individuals to sue based on their unemployment status.

Answer: 0"
160,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney wants to end tax credits for wind producers is false. Mitt Romney has not proposed or advocated for the elimination of tax credits for wind producers. In fact, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney supported renewable energy initiatives, including wind energy. He did not propose any significant changes to tax credits for wind producers during his campaign or subsequent political career.

Answer: 0"
161,"Explanation: The claim that the deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling will directly link a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts for the first time ever is false. While it is true that debt ceiling increases often come with conditions or offsets, such as spending cuts or revenue increases, the claim that this is the first time ever is incorrect. There have been numerous instances in the past where debt ceiling increases were accompanied by spending cuts or other offsets.

Answer: 0"
162,"Explanation: The claim that Ron Paul's voting record is virtually identical to his voting record except for foreign policy is false. Ron Paul's voting record is known for its consistency in certain areas, such as his opposition to the Federal Reserve and his support for limited government. However, his voting record is not identical to his voting record, as he has voted differently on various issues, including foreign policy. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
163,"Explanation: The claim that the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse is an exaggeration. While it is true that the 2008 financial crisis had a disproportionate impact on African-American communities, with many losing their homes and savings, the claim that they lost half of their wealth is not accurate. According to a report by the Pew Research Center, the median wealth of African-American households fell by 34% between 2005 and 2010, but this does not equate to a loss of half of their wealth.

Answer: 0"
164,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report. The CBO estimated that a cap-and-trade program could increase the cost of living for the average family by about $1,000 per year. This is not equivalent to a postage stamp a day, which costs about $0.50. The claim exaggerates the impact of the CBO's findings.

Answer: 0"
165,"Explanation: The claim about campaign contributions from electric utilities is generally true. Many electric utilities in the United States are regulated by state public utility commissions and are required to disclose their political contributions. These contributions are often made to support candidates who are seen as favorable to the industry's interests, such as those who support deregulation or other industry-friendly policies.

Answer: 1"
166,"Explanation: The claim states that Jon Corzine did not raise tolls by 50 percent. However, this claim is false because Jon Corzine, who served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2002 to 2006, did indeed propose a 50 percent increase in tolls during his tenure. This proposal was part of a broader plan to address the state's budget deficit.

Answer: 0"
167,"Explanation: The claim that deep poverty has reached its highest level on record over the past three years is false. According to the World Bank, the global poverty rate has been declining over the past few decades. In 2015, the global poverty rate was 10.0%, and by 2018, it had fallen to 8.6%. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on poverty rates, the World Bank's latest data shows that the global poverty rate in 2020 was 9.1%, which is still lower than the rate in 2015. Therefore, the claim that deep poverty has reached its highest level on record is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
168,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military has not asked for is false. Romney has proposed increasing the defense budget, but the specific figure of $2 trillion is not accurate. He has suggested increasing the defense budget by around $100 billion, which is a significant increase but not the $2 trillion mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the claim that the military has not asked for this increase is misleading, as the military has requested increases in the defense budget.

Answer: 0"
169,"Explanation: The claim states that Michael Williams, a U.S. House opponent, does not live in and has never voted in the congressional district he is seeking to represent. This claim is false because it is a common practice for candidates to run for office in districts where they do not currently reside. Many candidates move to the district they are running in or have lived there previously. The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that Williams has never voted in the district or does not live there.

Answer: 0"
170,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal corporate tax rate is 21%, not 44.6%. Additionally, the Canadian federal corporate tax rate is 15%, but this is not the total business tax rate in Canada. Provincial and territorial taxes also apply, which can increase the overall tax burden. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. tax rate on successful small businesses is 44.6% and the business tax rate in Canada is 15% is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
171,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the annual spending on highways to the total spending on Amtrak over its entire 40-year history. The claim is false because it is comparing apples to oranges. The spending on highways is an annual figure, while the spending on Amtrak is a cumulative figure over 40 years. Therefore, the claim is misleading and cannot be accurately judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
172,"Explanation: Deer baiting, also known as deer hunting with the use of bait, is indeed illegal in Rhode Island. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) has regulations in place that prohibit the use of bait for deer hunting. Therefore, the claim that deer baiting planned for Block Island by DEM is illegal in Rhode Island is true.

Answer: 1"
173,"Explanation: The claim that Liberty University students were mandated to attend Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential announcement or face a fine is false. There is no credible source or official statement from Liberty University or Sen. Ted Cruz that supports this claim. The university has not implemented such a policy, and Sen. Cruz's announcement was open to the public without any attendance requirements or fines.

Answer: 0"
174,"Explanation: The claim that Slim Jims just recently cost 99 cents but now cost $2.69 is false. Slim Jims have consistently been priced at $2.69 for a pack of 10. There is no evidence to suggest that the price has recently changed to 99 cents.

Answer: 0"
175,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry agreed to lift Iran's economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct is false. In 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed, which included the lifting of sanctions in exchange for Iran's compliance with the agreement. However, the claim that this was done without any proof of change in conduct is misleading, as the agreement was based on Iran's commitment to limit its nuclear program and allow for inspections.

Answer: 0"
176,"Explanation: The claim that you can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes is an oversimplification. While Estonia does offer an online tax filing system, the time it takes to complete the process can vary depending on the complexity of your tax situation. For instance, if you have a simple tax return with no deductions or credits, it might take less than five minutes. However, if you have multiple sources of income, deductions, or credits, the process could take significantly longer. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
177,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Oregon Department of Human Services in 2010. The study found that approximately 75% of child abuse and neglect reports in Oregon were made by individuals who were required to report by law, such as teachers, healthcare providers, and law enforcement officers. This information is accurate and has been verified by multiple sources.

Answer: 1"
178,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Oregon Health Authority, which found that the implementation of Oregon's prescription-only law for pseudoephedrine (a common ingredient in methamphetamine) led to a significant reduction in meth lab incidents and arrests. The study reported a 96% decrease in meth lab incidents and a 32% decrease in meth-related arrests. These figures are supported by data and are not disputed by any credible sources.

Answer: 1"
179,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to suggest that OShaughnessy voted for her own personal stimulus package or received a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
180,"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a fictional character, Chet, who is not a real person and does not have a political stance or influence. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the truth of this claim as it is not based on any real event or person.

Answer: 0"
181,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While it is accurate that health care premiums have increased since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the statement that they have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years is not supported by data. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, premiums have increased at a slower rate than in previous years, but this does not mean they are the slowest increase in the last 50 years.

Answer: 0"
182,"Explanation: Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia Attorney General, has been criticized for his stance on immigration and social welfare policies. However, there is no widely reported or verified claim that he has specifically ""attacked churches for helping the poor."" While he has been critical of certain policies and organizations, there is no evidence to support the claim that he has targeted churches for their assistance to the poor.

Answer: 0"
183,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the outcomes of two different individuals' actions, Hillary Clinton and General David Petraeus, in relation to their respective scandals. The email scandal involving Hillary Clinton involved her use of a private email server for official communications, which was criticized for potential security risks and lack of transparency. General Petraeus, on the other hand, was involved in a scandal where he shared classified information with his mistress, which led to his resignation from the CIA and a prison sentence. The claim suggests that Clinton was let off the hook while Petraeus faced severe consequences. However, this is a simplification and an oversimplification of the facts. Clinton faced significant political and legal scrutiny, including investigations by the FBI and the House Select Committee on Benghazi, but was not charged with any crime. Petraeus, while facing severe consequences, was not ""destroyed"" in the sense that he was not imprisoned for a long period or faced life-altering penalties. The claim is misleading and inaccurate in its comparison.

Answer: 0"
184,"Explanation: The claim that a filibuster has never been successfully used against a Supreme Court justice is false. The most notable example is the 1968 filibuster against the nomination of Abe Fortas to the Supreme Court. The filibuster was led by Senator Strom Thurmond and lasted for 24 hours, but ultimately failed to prevent Fortas' confirmation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
185,"Explanation: The claim that scientists are questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is causing climate change is misleading. While there is ongoing scientific research and debate about various aspects of climate change, the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has repeatedly stated that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Therefore, the claim that this idea is ""more and more being put into question"" is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
186,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate is not supported by empirical evidence. While some studies have suggested that financial stress can contribute to divorce, there is no direct correlation between the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and an increase in divorce rates. Obamacare primarily focuses on expanding access to healthcare, not on marital status or divorce rates.

Answer: 0"
187,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or statement from Madison Mayor Paul Soglins indicating that his proposal to have city contractors disclose private political donations was intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees. The proposal was likely made to increase transparency and accountability in political donations, not to target specific organizations or donors.

Answer: 0"
188,"Explanation: The claim that Providence is one of the busiest fire departments for its relative size in the country is difficult to verify without specific data or a reliable source. The busiest fire departments are often determined by factors such as population density, number of fires, and response times. Without concrete evidence or a reputable source, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
189,"Explanation: The claim that former President Barack Obama refused to put his hand on his heart or say the Pledge of Allegiance is false. There is no credible evidence or historical record to support this claim. In fact, President Obama participated in the Pledge of Allegiance and other patriotic ceremonies during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
190,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about the plan and the criteria for qualifying for income-tax relief. It also does not provide any evidence or sources to support the claim that 98 percent of all small businesses in Wisconsin will qualify. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
191,"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a statement made by Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, where he criticized Hillary Clinton for her stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. The claim suggests that Clinton changed her position on the TPP after Trump's criticism, implying a shift in her stance. However, this claim is false because Hillary Clinton was consistently against the TPP throughout her 2016 campaign and did not change her position based on Trump's statements.

Answer: 0"
192,"Explanation: The claim about the status of illegal immigrants is a broad topic and can vary depending on the specific context and location. Without specific details, it's challenging to determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if the claim is about a general status or policy, it would need to be backed by reliable sources and current information to be considered true.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or needs more specific information to be evaluated as true.)"
193,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Johnson Amendment, which was indeed pushed by Lyndon B. Johnson, does not threaten religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. The amendment, passed in 1954, prohibits 501(c)(3) organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates. However, it does not strip them of their tax-exempt status if they engage in political activities, as long as they do so in a non-partisan manner and do not endorse or oppose specific candidates.

Answer: 0"
194,"Explanation: The claim that Jack Kingston had more earmarks at one time than every member of the Georgia delegation put together is a specific and quantifiable statement. To verify this claim, one would need to compare the number of earmarks received by Jack Kingston with the total number of earmarks received by all other members of the Georgia delegation during the same period. Without specific data or a reliable source to support this claim, it is not possible to definitively determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
195,"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Gang of Eight"" bill, also known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did not give President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees without background checks. The bill included provisions for background checks for refugees, including Syrian refugees. The bill also established a process for reviewing and admitting refugees based on security and humanitarian considerations.

Answer: 0"
196,"Explanation: The claim that the speaker stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 is false. Earmarks are specific funding requests for particular projects or programs, and they were widely used by members of Congress until they were largely phased out in 2011 due to public outcry and bipartisan efforts to reduce their use. Therefore, the claim that the speaker stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
197,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of events: lightning strikes and voter fraud. The likelihood of being struck by lightning is a function of weather patterns and geographical location, while voter fraud is a legal and political issue. According to the National Weather Service, Texas is one of the states with the highest number of lightning strikes due to its size and the frequency of thunderstorms. On the other hand, voter fraud is a rare event, and its incidence is typically very low. Therefore, the claim that you are more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find in-person voter fraud is true.

Answer: 1"
198,"Explanation: The claim about whether the federal government should set a minimum wage is a topic of ongoing debate and policy discussion. It is not a fact that can be definitively judged as true or false because it depends on one's perspective and the specific context of the discussion. The federal government has set a minimum wage in the past, and the debate revolves around whether it should continue to do so, increase it, or leave it to the states.

Answer: 0 (The claim is not a definitive fact and cannot be judged as true or false.)"
199,"Explanation: The claim that eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke since 2010 is false. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there have been 52 child vehicular heatstroke deaths in the United States from 1998 to 2020. However, the claim specifies eight children in Georgia, which is not accurate. The NHTSA does not provide specific state-by-state data for child vehicular heatstroke deaths.

Answer: 0"
200,"Explanation: The claim that eight Americans died in a knife attack at a Minnesota mall is false. There have been no reports of such an incident. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misreporting of a different event or a hoax.

Answer: 0"
201,"Explanation: The claim states that the person has only engaged in the political process in the past decade. Without specific information about the person's political activities before this period, it is impossible to verify the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0/1"
202,"Explanation: The term ""carpet bombing"" refers to the extensive and indiscriminate bombing of a large area, often a city or a populated region, to achieve a strategic or tactical goal. It does not specifically refer to bombing the location of troops with embedded special forces to direct air power. The term is more commonly used to describe the bombing of civilian areas rather than military targets. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
203,"Explanation: The claim that ""Too many tattoos on visible body parts keepsome applicants out of the military"" is generally true. The U.S. military, for example, has specific regulations regarding tattoos. The Army, for instance, allows tattoos on the arms, legs, and torso, but not on the head, neck, or hands. The Navy and Marine Corps have similar restrictions. These regulations are in place to maintain a professional appearance and to ensure that tattoos do not interfere with the wear of certain uniforms or equipment. Therefore, having too many tattoos on visible body parts can indeed disqualify some applicants from joining the military.

Answer: 1"
204,"Explanation: The claim ""You lie!"" is a direct response to President Obama's statement that health reform would not insure illegal immigrants. This claim is not a factual statement but rather an emotional or rhetorical response. It does not provide any evidence or information to support its truthfulness. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on factual information.

Answer: 0"
205,"Explanation: The claim ""The fact is it's not amnesty"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. Amnesty typically refers to the forgiveness of a crime or debt, often in exchange for a promise of good behavior. Without additional context or details about what is being forgiven or the circumstances surrounding the claim, it is impossible to definitively judge whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
206,"Explanation: The claim that ""I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon"" is false. In most countries, including the United States, it is illegal for private citizens to purchase automatic weapons. Automatic weapons are heavily regulated and typically require special permits or licenses, and they are not available for purchase by the general public. The claim that ""Most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon"" is also false, as the vast majority of people cannot legally purchase automatic weapons.

Answer: 0"
207,"Explanation: The claim is made by former Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. While it is difficult to quantify the exact level of unpopularity of any governor, Christie's tenure was marked by controversies and low approval ratings. For instance, a 2014 poll by Quinnipiac University found that 42% of New Jersey residents approved of Christie's job performance, while 51% disapproved. This indicates that Christie was indeed unpopular during his tenure. However, the claim that he was ""maybe the most unpopular governor in the country"" is subjective and cannot be definitively proven. Therefore, the claim is partially true but lacks specific evidence to support the ""most unpopular"" part.

Answer: 0.5"
208,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats plan to raise tax rates to 70 or 80 percent is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible evidence or official proposal from the Democratic Party or any of its prominent figures suggesting such a drastic increase in tax rates. Tax policy proposals from Democrats typically focus on progressive taxation, which aims to increase the tax burden on higher-income individuals, but not to the extent of 70 or 80 percent.

Answer: 0"
209,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, also known as Act 10, did not seek 12 percent to 13 percent of public employees' incomes for health insurance premiums. The bill primarily focused on reducing collective bargaining rights and increasing employee contributions to health insurance and pension plans. The specific percentage increase in employee contributions was not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
210,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's energy agenda will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion is a misrepresentation of her actual policies and their potential impacts. Hillary Clinton's energy agenda, as outlined during her 2016 presidential campaign, focused on transitioning to renewable energy sources, investing in clean energy technologies, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While these policies could have significant costs, the claim of a $5 trillion cost is not supported by credible sources or analyses. The $5 trillion figure appears to be a fabrication or an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
211,"Explanation: The claim that Fran DeWines made-from-scratch dinner rolls are a delicious favorite in a traditional Thanksgiving dinner is not verifiable as it does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the claim. Without concrete information or references, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
212,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has added 200,000 new federal jobs over the last two years since President Obama took office is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of federal employees has actually decreased since 2009. In 2009, there were approximately 2.1 million federal employees, and by 2011, the number had decreased to about 2.0 million. Therefore, the claim that 200,000 new federal jobs were added is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
213,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about unemployment rates in Southwest Virginia. While it is true that some counties in the region have high unemployment rates, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the exact figures mentioned (double digits and pushing 20 percent). Therefore, the claim is not verifiable without additional context or data.

Answer: 0"
214,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama said that small businesses succeed because of government is false. While President Obama did emphasize the importance of government support for small businesses, he did not attribute their success solely to government intervention. He often spoke about the need for a supportive environment, including regulations, access to capital, and other resources, but he also acknowledged the role of individual effort and innovation.

Answer: 0"
215,"Explanation: The claim that K-12 students in the United States are scoring at the bottom in science and mathematics in the industrialized world is not accurate. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is a global assessment of 15-year-olds' educational performance, the United States ranks 36th in mathematics and 24th in science among the 70 participating countries. While these rankings are not at the top, they are not at the bottom either. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
216,"Explanation: The claim that royalties for oil and other energy sources are the ""second-largest revenue source to the federal government after the IRS"" is not accurate. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is indeed the largest revenue source for the federal government, primarily through income taxes. Royalties from oil and other energy sources are significant, but they are not the second-largest revenue source. The second-largest revenue source is typically from payroll taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare taxes.

Answer: 0"
217,"Explanation: The Brady Bill, also known as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, was a piece of legislation aimed at preventing gun violence. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was a member of the House of Representatives at the time, voted against the bill five times. This information is well-documented and can be verified through historical records and news reports.

Answer: 1"
218,"Explanation: The claim that there are corporations in this nation who do not pay taxes is generally true. Many corporations, especially large ones, often use various legal strategies to minimize their tax liabilities. These strategies can include tax avoidance through loopholes in the tax code, shifting profits to lower-tax jurisdictions, or taking advantage of tax incentives and credits. However, it's important to note that the extent to which corporations avoid taxes can vary widely, and some corporations do pay significant amounts of taxes.

Answer: 1"
219,"Explanation: The claim that a congressional district is the fourth-poorest in the nation is not verifiable without specific data or context. The ranking of congressional districts by poverty rates can change and is typically based on the latest census data. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
220,"Explanation: The claim that Patrick Murphy wrongly conveyed Rubio's stance on abortion for women infected by Zika is a matter of political interpretation and can vary based on the source and context. However, if the claim is based on a specific statement or policy position by Rubio, it would need to be evaluated against that specific statement or policy. Without specific details or a clear source, it's challenging to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
221,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the recent drop in the unemployment rate is questionable because it was calculated over two days of the Thanksgiving week. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) typically adjusts its unemployment rate calculations to account for holidays and other factors that might affect the data. The BLS uses a method called the ""seasonal adjustment"" to account for these variations, ensuring that the unemployment rate reflects a consistent period of time. Therefore, the claim that the drop in unemployment rate is questionable due to the calculation period is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
222,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama said we should talk to Iran in his first TV interview as president is false. While President Obama did advocate for diplomatic engagement with Iran, this specific quote is not from his first TV interview as president. The misquote is often attributed to a 2009 interview with ABC News, but the exact quote was not ""we should talk to Iran"" but rather ""we should engage with Iran.""

Answer: 0"
223,"Explanation: The claim ""I have never voted for a tax increase"" is a statement of personal belief or action, and without specific evidence or context, it is impossible to verify its truthfulness. It could be true or false depending on the individual's voting history and the specific tax increases in question.

Answer: 0"
224,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that some coal mines in Tennessee are located above 2,000 feet, it is not accurate to say that ""all the coal in the state of Tennessee is above 2,000 feet."" There are also coal mines located below 2,000 feet in the state. The claim is a misrepresentation of the actual situation.

Answer: 0"
225,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's re-election would result in state and federal income tax rates rising to roughly 65 percent for some taxpayers is false. During President Obama's second term, the top federal income tax rate was 39.6 percent for individuals earning over $400,000. Additionally, state income tax rates varied widely and did not reach 65 percent for any taxpayer. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of tax policy changes that occurred during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
226,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his position on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Initially, Romney supported the TARP program during his 2012 presidential campaign. However, after his defeat, he criticized the program and its effectiveness. In 2014, he stated that he would have opposed the TARP program if he had been president. Therefore, the claim that Romney has changed his position on supporting the TARP program is true.

Answer: 1"
227,"Explanation: The claim that the St. Norbert College/Wisconsin Public Radio poll has been wrong in almost every election is not accurate. While polls can sometimes be inaccurate, it is not accurate to say that they have been wrong in almost every election. Polls are a valuable tool for predicting election outcomes, and their accuracy can vary depending on the specific election and the methodology used. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
228,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Government Accountability Board (GAB) never considered Mickey Mouse or Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions. The GAB's role is to ensure that recall petitions meet certain legal requirements, including that signatures are from registered voters and are not forged or fraudulent. The claim is a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the GAB's role and responsibilities.

229,"Explanation: The claim is false. Ohio has a history of passing legislation to stop referendums. For example, in 2011, the Ohio legislature passed a law that required signatures for ballot initiatives to be collected in a specific order, which was later ruled unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court. Therefore, the claim that an effort to repeal voting-reform legislation would be the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum is incorrect.

236,"Explanation: The claim that ""Congress as a whole is less popular than it has been since polling was invented"" is difficult to verify without specific data and context. Popularity of Congress can vary greatly depending on the time period, specific events, and the political climate. However, general trends in public opinion polls can provide some insight. According to various polls and surveys, Congress has consistently been one of the least popular institutions in the United States for many years. While it's challenging to pinpoint an exact point in history where Congress was more popular, it's generally accepted that public opinion of Congress has been low for a significant period.

Answer: 1"
237,"Explanation: The claim that abortion has reduced the black population by more than 25 percent since 1973 is false. Abortion rates are influenced by various factors, including socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and cultural attitudes. While it is true that abortion rates are higher among certain racial and ethnic groups, this does not mean that abortion is the primary cause of population changes. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to support the 25 percent reduction figure.

Answer: 0"
238,"Explanation: The claim that there have been 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789 is false. The actual number of amendments proposed to the U.S. Constitution is significantly lower. As of 2021, there have been 33 amendments proposed, with 27 of them being ratified and added to the Constitution. The claim of 11,000 attempts is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
242,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump promised to take care of everybody through government-run healthcare and that the government would pay for it is false.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
245,"Explanation: The claim that the state of New York is the worst in the nation in economic recovery is not accurate. While New York has faced significant economic challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in industries like tourism and hospitality, it has also shown signs of recovery. According to various economic indicators, such as unemployment rates and GDP growth, New York's economic recovery has been progressing, albeit at a slower pace compared to some other states. Therefore, it is not accurate to label New York as the ""worst"" in the nation in economic recovery.

Answer: 0"

The CIA's warnings were general and did not include the specific intelligence that would have allowed the Bush administration to prevent the attacks.

Answer: 0"
247,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has publicly stated her views on gun control, including her support for background checks and restrictions on certain types of firearms. However, she has not explicitly stated that she does not believe in the right to keep a gun at home for self-defense. Her views are more focused on reducing gun violence and improving safety measures rather than denying individuals' rights to own firearms for self-defense. Therefore, the claim that Hillary Clinton does not believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense is false.

The NSDUH reported that about 30% of people who use marijuana daily meet the criteria for marijuana use disorder. The claim that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted is an exaggeration of the actual data.

Answer: 0"
252,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Chris Christie's decision to close the Elizabeth MVC (Motor Vehicle Commission) saved no money is false. The closure of the MVC was part of a broader effort to reduce state spending and improve efficiency. While the closure may have resulted in some cost savings, it is not accurate to say that it saved no money. The closure led to the elimination of certain administrative positions and reduced operational costs, which did result in savings.

Answer: 0"
253,"Explanation: The claim that ""Sixty percent of New Jersey doctors do not accept Medicaid patients"" is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
254,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the personal lives of former U.S. President Barack Obama and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Answer: 0"
255,"Explanation: The claim that healthcare is the greatest contribution to spending increases in the state budget is generally true. Healthcare costs are often a significant portion of state budgets due to the high cost of medical services, medications, and the need to provide care for a large number of residents. This is especially true in states with large elderly populations or those with high rates of chronic diseases.

Answer: 1"
256,"Explanation: The claim that Romneycare was a model for Obamacare is true. Romneycare, also known as the Massachusetts Health Care Reform, was implemented by Mitt Romney when he was the governor of Massachusetts.

Both policies aimed to expand health insurance coverage, although they differ in their specific provisions and implementation.

Answer: 1"
257,"Explanation: The claim is false. The $290 million structural surplus in the 2011-13 Wisconsin budget was not solely based on the assumption that Congress would reinstate the estate tax. The surplus was primarily due to a combination of factors, including increased revenue from sales tax, income tax, and other sources. The estate tax assumption was one of several factors considered in the budget projections, but it was not the sole basis for the surplus.

Answer: 0"
258,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of individuals whose rights have been restored before April 22 with the combined efforts of seven governors over their four-year terms. Without specific data or context about the number of individuals whose rights were restored by the governors, it is impossible to verify the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
259,"Explanation: The claim is false. The poverty rate among the elderly in the United States has indeed decreased significantly over time. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1935, the poverty rate for the elderly was around 50%. However, by 2020, the poverty rate for the elderly was around 9.7%, not 9.4%. The claim incorrectly states the current poverty rate as 9.4%.

Answer: 0"
260,"Explanation: The claim that the Senate health care bill ""would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage"" is based on a study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO estimated that the bill, as proposed, would result in 24 million fewer people having health insurance coverage by 2026. This estimate was made based on the bill's provisions, which include repealing the individual mandate and reducing federal funding for Medicaid expansion.

Answer: 1"

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in 2020, there were about 150 million people employed in the private sector. Therefore, the claim that more Americans receive food aid than work in the private sector is false.

Answer: 0"
262,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, water usage in Georgia did indeed decrease between 1980 and 2010, despite a significant increase in the state's population. This is likely due to various factors such as increased water conservation efforts, improved water management practices, and changes in agricultural and industrial water use.

Answer: 1"
263,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) does not have the authority to impose taxes on individuals or entities. The UNGA is a deliberative body that makes recommendations to member states, but it does not have the power to enforce laws or impose taxes. Taxation is a matter of national sovereignty and is typically handled by the legislative bodies of individual countries.

Answer: 0"
264,"Explanation: The claim that the newly proposed House Republican budget abolishes Medicare within 10 years is false. The House Republican budget proposal, known as the ""American Families Plan,"" does not include a provision to abolish Medicare.

The claim is a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual proposal.

265,"Explanation: Lamar Smith was a Republican Congressman who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1997 to 2019.

Answer: 0"
266,"Explanation: According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, hate crimes are reported by law enforcement agencies across the United States. The FBI's 2019 Hate Crime Statistics report shows that LGBT individuals were the most targeted group for hate crimes, with 1,617 incidents reported. This is more than any other recognized group, including racial or ethnic groups, religious groups, and disability groups. Therefore, the claim that the LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group is true.

Answer: 1"
267,"Explanation: The claim that the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased since the passage of ObamaCare (the Affordable Care Act) and the stimulus package is false. The unemployment rate in the U.S. actually decreased after the implementation of these policies. The Affordable Care Act provided health insurance to millions of Americans, and the stimulus package included measures to stimulate the economy during the Great Recession. Both policies had positive impacts on the economy and employment rates.

Answer: 0"
268,"Explanation: The claim that the United States pays China $73.9 million in interest on its debt each day is false. The U.S. does owe China a significant amount of money, but the interest payments are not calculated on a daily basis. The U.S. Treasury Department reports that the total interest paid to China in 2020 was approximately $12.5 billion, which is about $34.2 million per day. However, this is an annual figure, not a daily one.

Answer: 0"
269,"Explanation: The claim is false. Sen. Jim Webb and Sen. Mark Warner are both prominent figures in the Democratic Party, and there is no evidence to suggest that Sen. Webb has been persistently negating Sen. Warner's votes. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication.

270,"Explanation: Rhode Island's unemployment compensation rate is indeed considered generous compared to many other states. As of 2021, Rhode Island's maximum unemployment benefit is $484 per week, which is higher than the maximum benefits in many other states. However, it's important to note that the generosity of unemployment benefits can vary based on factors such as the state's economy, the cost of living, and the specific unemployment insurance program's rules.

Answer: 1"
271,"Explanation: The claim is true. The person referred to is likely Janet Yellen, who served as the Chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018. She did indeed call for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages, and improving financial oversight early on in the financial crisis. These actions were part of her efforts to stabilize the financial system and prevent a recurrence of the crisis.

Answer: 1"
272,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Constitution, members of Congress are paid by the federal government. During a government shutdown, which occurs when Congress and the President cannot agree on a budget, federal employees, including members of Congress, are typically not paid. However, there is a provision in the Constitution that ensures members of Congress are paid for their services, even during a shutdown. This is because the Constitution states that members of Congress are to be paid for their services, and this payment is considered a ""necessary expense"" that cannot be withheld.

Answer: 1"
273,"Explanation: The claim that Obama has flip-flopped on public campaign financing is false. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama initially accepted public campaign financing, but later decided to forgo it in order to raise funds through private donations. This decision was made to avoid the spending limits and restrictions associated with public financing. Therefore, the claim that he has flip-flopped on this issue is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
274,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), also known as the amnesty act, was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. However, the claim that this act gave Barack Obama about 15 million additional Hispanic votes in 2012 is unfounded. The IRCA did not directly influence the 2012 presidential election, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it resulted in a significant increase in Hispanic votes for Obama.

Answer: 0"
275,"Explanation: The claim that Nevada lawmakers permanently cut taxes for over 95 percent of Nevada's businesses is not accurate. While there have been tax cuts and reforms in Nevada, the claim that they apply to over 95 percent of businesses is an exaggeration. The actual percentage of businesses that benefit from these tax cuts is lower. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
276,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump said the government is going to pay for everybody to have health care is false. During his presidency, Trump did not propose a universal healthcare plan where the government would pay for everyone's healthcare. Instead, he focused on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and promoting market-based healthcare reforms. There is no evidence to support the claim that Trump made such a statement.

Answer: 0"
277,"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration ""gutted"" the Project ChildSafe budget to provide trigger locks and safety kits is misleading. The Project ChildSafe program was established in 1999, during the Clinton administration, and was not directly related to the Obama administration. The program provides free gunlocks to gun owners to help prevent accidental shootings. The Obama administration did not ""gut"" the budget for this program; instead, it continued to support it. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
278,"Explanation: Ebola is primarily transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of an infected person, or indirect contact with surfaces or objects contaminated with these fluids. While it is possible for Ebola to be transmitted through the air in a laboratory setting, such as through an aerosolized virus, this is not a typical or common mode of transmission in the real world. The claim that Ebola can be transmitted through a sneeze or cough is not supported by scientific evidence and is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the virus's transmission methods.

Answer: 0"
279,"Explanation: The claim that the bishops of the United States came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care in 1919 is false. The bishops' support for universal healthcare is a more recent development.

Answer: 0"
280,"Explanation: The claim ""On support for Ronald Reagan's policies"" is incomplete and lacks specific details.

Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
281,"Explanation: The claim that Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland voted to keep guns away from private citizens in Washington, D.C., is false. Merrick Garland has not voted on any specific legislation related to gun control in Washington, D.C. His nomination to the Supreme Court was made by President Obama in 2016, and he was never confirmed by the Senate. Therefore, there is no record of him voting on any such legislation.

Answer: 0"
282,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Supreme Court of the United States has not made 15 rulings stating that marriage is a fundamental right. The most relevant case is Loving v. Virginia (1967), where the Court ruled that laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional. However, the Court has not explicitly stated that marriage must be between a man and a woman. The claim also misrepresents the history and interpretation of the Court's rulings.

Answer: 0"
283,"Explanation: The claim that ""the money is in the budget to give a tax break to everyone, including people making more than $1 million"" is false. The U.S. federal budget does not typically include provisions for universal tax breaks, especially for high-income individuals. Tax policy changes, including tax breaks, are usually targeted and specific, rather than universal. Therefore, the claim is not supported by factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
284,"Explanation: The claim that Dan Patrick has called immigration into Texas an ""invasion"" and said immigrants bring ""third-world diseases"" is false. Dan Patrick, a sports commentator and former NFL executive, has not made these statements.

Answer: 0"
285,"Explanation: The claim is false. Ohio has not won the presidency 25 out of 27 times since 1904. Ohio has only won the presidency 8 times in total, with the last win being in 1960. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation of the fact that Ohio has been a swing state in recent elections.

Answer: 0"
286,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require members of Congress to purchase their health insurance from the new exchanges. Instead, members of Congress and their staff are eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a separate health insurance program for federal employees. The ACA does not apply to members of Congress in the same way it does to the general public.

Answer: 0"
287,"Explanation: The claim is false. The highest value of a General Motors share ever was not $43, $44, or $46. The highest value of a General Motors share was $143.50, which occurred on October 1, 2007. Therefore, the claim that GM would have to sell its shares at $143 a share to pay back everything it owes is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
288,"Explanation: The claim that the House of Delegates budget bill cuts $50 million from education is false.

Answer: 0"
289,"Explanation: In Texas, public schools are required to teach science in a way that is consistent with the scientific method and the standards set by the Texas State Board of Education. While the Texas Education Code does not explicitly prohibit the teaching of creationism, it does not require it either. The focus is on teaching evolution as a scientific theory. Therefore, the claim that Texas teaches both creationism and evolution in public schools is misleading because while evolution is taught, creationism is not.

Answer: 0"
290,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a telecom bill could prevent the State Corporation Commission (SCC) from obtaining rate-of-return information from electric utilities. This claim is false because the SCC's authority to regulate and oversee electric utilities is not dependent on a telecom bill. The SCC's role in regulating utilities is established by law and is not affected by telecommunications legislation. Therefore, a telecom bill would not impact the SCC's ability to gather rate-of-return information.

Answer: 0"
291,"Explanation: The claim states that pension contributions under Gov. Chris Christie would represent 75 percent of the total contribution made between the years 1995 and 2010. However, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to support this statement. Without concrete evidence or data, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
292,"Explanation: The claim that a specific individual balanced the budget for four straight years and paid off $405 billion in debt is not verifiable without additional context. Balancing the budget and paying off debt are significant achievements that would typically be widely reported and verified by multiple credible sources. Without specific details about the individual making the claim and the context in which these actions were taken, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
293,"Explanation: The claim that a majority of Americans since Harry Truman days support single-payer health insurance, or full Medicare for all, is not accurate. While there has been consistent support for some form of universal healthcare among Americans, the specific support for single-payer or full Medicare for all has varied over time. Polls and surveys have shown that support for these ideas has fluctuated, and there is no consistent majority support dating back to the Harry Truman era. Additionally, the specific terminology and details of these proposals can influence public opinion, making it difficult to pinpoint a consistent majority support.

Answer: 0"
294,"Explanation: The claim that the Benghazi probe is the longest-running congressional investigation ever is false. While the Benghazi investigation was extensive and lasted for several years, it is not the longest-running congressional investigation in history. The Watergate investigation, for example, lasted from 1972 to 1974, which is longer than the Benghazi probe.

Answer: 0"
295,"Explanation: The claim suggests that repealing the prevailing wage law would make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers. However, prevailing wage laws are typically designed to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage, and repealing such laws would not inherently create a loophole for hiring illegal workers. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the effects of repealing prevailing wage laws. Additionally, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that there is an ""illegal worker loophole"" in the state budget.

Answer: 0"
296,"Explanation: The United States Constitution does not explicitly state that people can be put to death. However, it does allow for the death penalty through the Fifth Amendment, which states that ""No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" This allows for the death penalty as a form of punishment for certain crimes. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
297,"Explanation: The claim is false. The stimulus money funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was intended to create jobs and stimulate the economy. The claim that a government board made recommendations that would cost 378,000 jobs and $28.3 billion in sales is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. The stimulus package was designed to create jobs and boost the economy, not to eliminate them.

Answer: 0"
298,"Explanation: While it is true that some smaller cities and counties in Georgia may not have official websites or email addresses for their elected officials, it is not accurate to say that this is a widespread or universal issue. Many local governments in Georgia do have official websites and email addresses for their elected officials. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
299,"Explanation: The claim that United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math is false. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a global assessment that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science. The United States typically ranks in the middle of the pack among developed countries, not developing countries. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the PISA results.

Answer: 0"
300,"Explanation: The claim that ""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work"" is not supported by reliable sources or empirical evidence. Smart guns, which are firearms with built-in safety features, are designed to prevent unauthorized use. The claim suggests that these features fail 20% of the time, which contradicts the purpose and design of smart guns. There is no credible data or studies to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
301,"Explanation: The claim states that the Rhode Island Parole Board never received an objection from the attorney general to the parole of convicted murderer Alfred Brissette. This claim is false because there is evidence that the Rhode Island Attorney General's office did object to Brissette's parole. The Attorney General's office filed a motion to block Brissette's parole, which was denied by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

Answer: 0"
302,"Explanation: The claim that Guantanamo has never been a key component of ISIS or al-Qaida propaganda is false. Both ISIS and al-Qaida have used Guantanamo Bay detention camp as a propaganda tool to rally support and recruit new members. They have often highlighted the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo to portray the United States as unjust and to gain sympathy for their cause. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
303,"Explanation: The claim that Rep. Adam Putnam was silent when Rush Limbaugh called Sonia Sotomayor a racist is false. Rep. Adam Putnam, a Republican from Florida, has been critical of Rush Limbaugh's comments and has publicly condemned them. He has stated that Limbaugh's comments were ""racist"" and ""unacceptable."" Therefore, the claim that Putnam was silent is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
304,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different flat tax plans proposed by George Allen and Perry. Without specific details about the tax rates, deductions, and other components of each plan, it's impossible to accurately determine which plan would shrink revenues further.

Answer: 0"
305,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. Texas does not have a state income tax, but Oklahoma has been reducing its income tax rates. However, the claim about Oklahoma's severance tax being ""sky high"" is not accurate. Oklahoma's severance tax rates are not exceptionally high compared to other states. The claim is misleading by using the term ""sky high"" to exaggerate the situation.

306,"Explanation: Sarah Palin served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009, which is a total of 3 years. She also served as the Republican nominee for Vice President in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election. However, she did not hold any elected office after her term as Governor. Therefore, the claim that she has had 12 years of elected office experience is false.

Answer: 0"
307,"Explanation: The claim that 75 percent of United States airstrikes against ISIS return to base without having fired a weapon is not accurate. While it is true that some airstrikes do not result in weapons being fired, the percentage of such missions is not 75%. The actual percentage varies and is not consistently 75%. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the data.

308,"Explanation: The claim is false. In 2008, African-Americans did not vote their percentage of the population in Mississippi. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, African-Americans made up about 37% of Mississippi's population in 2008, but they only accounted for about 25% of the votes in that state. Therefore, the claim that Mississippi would suddenly become a Democratic state if African-Americans voted their percentage of the population is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
309,"Explanation: The claim that Ann Kuster said the debate over America's debt limit is not an important issue of the day is false. Ann Kuster, a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, has publicly stated that the debt ceiling is a critical issue and has been actively involved in discussions and negotiations regarding it. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
310,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government does not deport criminals is false. The U.S. federal government, through the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), does deport criminals.

The FBI director's statement was a part of the investigation's findings.

313,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney gave money to Democrats for Congress in 1992 is false. Mitt Romney was a Republican and served as the Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994 and for the U.S. presidency in 2012. There is no evidence to suggest that he donated money to Democrats for Congress in 1992.

Answer: 0"
314,"Explanation: The claim that Harry Reid's plan is ""basically giving the president a blank check"" is a political statement that is subjective and depends on one's interpretation of Reid's plan. Reid's plan, often referred to as the ""Reid Plan,"" was a proposal to raise the debt ceiling without any specific spending cuts or revenue increases. This plan was criticized by some as giving the president a ""blank check"" because it would allow the president to increase the debt without any immediate fiscal responsibility. However, this interpretation is a matter of political opinion and not a verifiable fact.

Answer: 0"
315,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific event involving the payment of a ransom to Iran for hostages, which is a sensitive and high-profile topic. However, the claim is made in a way that suggests the speaker has personal knowledge of a videotape of this event, which is not a widely reported or verified source of information. Without credible evidence or sources to support this claim, it is not possible to verify its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
316,"Explanation: The claim that there have been no cases of wolves killing people in Rocky Mountain states is false. While wolf attacks on humans are rare, there have been instances of wolves attacking and killing people in the Rocky Mountain states. For example, in 2010, a 19-year-old woman was killed by a wolf in Yellowstone National Park. Additionally, there have been other incidents where wolves have injured or killed people in the region.

Answer: 0"
317,"Explanation: The claim that ""Sixty-one percent of our bridges are in trouble"" is not specific enough to be verified as true or false without additional context. The term ""in trouble"" is subjective and could mean different things to different people. It could refer to structural issues, maintenance needs, or other factors. Without a clear definition of what ""in trouble"" means and specific data sources, it is impossible to accurately assess the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
318,"Explanation: Jeff Merkley was indeed a key figure in the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2010, but he was not the deciding vote. The deciding vote was cast by Senator Joe Lieberman, who switched his vote from opposing to supporting the bill after negotiations. Merkley's role was significant, but he did not cast the deciding vote. Additionally, the claim that Obamacare has been an unmitigated disaster in Oregon is a matter of opinion and depends on the specific metrics and perspectives used to evaluate its impact.

Answer: 0"
319,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that a 5% increase in domestic production would have a minimal impact on the world supply and prices. However, this claim oversimplifies the complex dynamics of global energy markets. A 5% increase in domestic production could have a more significant impact on the world supply and prices depending on various factors such as global demand, supply from other countries, and market reactions. Additionally, the claim does not account for potential changes in domestic consumption patterns or the potential for increased domestic production to influence international prices.

Answer: 0"
320,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that every time the price of gasoline rises by 1 cent, it takes a billion dollars out of the economy and sends it to Saudi Arabia is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. The impact of a 1-cent increase in gasoline prices on the economy and on Saudi Arabia's revenue is not as direct or significant as the claim suggests. The claim also implies a direct correlation between the price of gasoline and Saudi Arabia's revenue, which is not accurate. The actual economic impact of gasoline price changes is more complex and involves various factors, including consumer spending, business operations, and global energy markets.

Answer: 0"
321,"Explanation: The claim about Nancy Pelosi and others staying at a five-star hotel during the Copenhagen summit and the cost of the trip is false. The Copenhagen summit, also known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference, was held in 2009. Nancy Pelosi, a prominent figure in U.S. politics, did attend the summit, but there is no credible evidence to support the claim that she or other attendees stayed at a five-star hotel costing nearly $10,000 per person. The cost of accommodation for such events is typically covered by the host country or the United Nations, and the details of individual expenses are not publicly disclosed.

Answer: 0"
322,"Explanation: Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that he will release his tax returns, but he has not done so. Therefore, the claim that he has not broken his promise to release his tax returns is true.

Answer: 1"
323,"Explanation: The claim that ""we cut taxes for 95 percent of working families"" is a generalization that is not supported by specific data or evidence. Tax cuts are typically targeted at specific income brackets or types of income, and the percentage of families benefiting from tax cuts can vary. Without specific details or data to back up the claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
324,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has a record number of abortions year after year is not accurate. According to the Guttmacher Institute, the number of abortions in the United States has been declining since the 1980s. In 2019, the number of abortions was at its lowest since 1973, the year Roe v. Wade was decided. The claim may be based on a misunderstanding of the data or a misinterpretation of recent trends.

Answer: 0"
325,"Explanation: While drone technology has advanced significantly, the claim that drones as small as birds can record individuals in their homes and immediately upload the footage to the internet is not accurate. Drones of that size would have limited battery life and storage capacity, making real-time uploading impractical. Additionally, the legal and ethical implications of such surveillance would be significant, and it's unlikely that such technology would be widely available or used without proper authorization.

Answer: 0"
326,"Explanation: The first word spoken from the moon was not ""Houston"". The first words spoken from the moon were ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,"" spoken by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969. The phrase ""Houston, we have a problem"" was famously spoken by Jack Swigert during the Apollo 13 mission, but it was not the first words spoken from the moon.

Answer: 0"
327,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading cause of death among African-American men aged 15-34 is homicide, not gun-related deaths specifically. While gun violence is a significant issue, it is not the leading cause of death when considering all causes of homicide. The claim exaggerates the impact of gun violence and misrepresents the data.

Answer: 0"
328,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Laureate Education, but there is no connection between Hillary Clinton's role and any alleged money laundering. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
329,"Explanation: The claim that the black unemployment rate has increased since the recovery has begun is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for black Americans has been decreasing since the recovery began. In January 2021, the unemployment rate for black Americans was 9.2%, and by October 2021, it had decreased to 7.9%. Therefore, the claim that the black unemployment rate has increased is incorrect.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
331,"Explanation: The claim states that only 18 percent of Portland elementary schools have art instruction compared to 83 percent nationally. This claim is comparing a specific local statistic (Portland) to a national average. Without specific data sources or references to support the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. However, the claim itself is not inherently false; it is a statement that could be true or false depending on the data sources used.

Answer: 0/1"
332,"Explanation: The claim about Bill White bringing in 250,000 refugees to Dallas and San Antonio after Hurricane Katrina and housing them in empty apartment buildings for over two years is not accurate. The actual number of refugees taken in by these cities was significantly lower, and the duration of their stay was also shorter. Additionally, the claim that most of these refugees are still on welfare is not supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
333,"Explanation: The claim states that salaries and benefits for Wisconsin state employees comprised 8.5 percent of the 2009-2011 state budget. To verify this, I would need to check the actual budget figures for those years. However, without specific data, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim. Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
334,"Explanation: The claim about Mary Burke wasting $12.5 million on a vacant lot and potentially costing taxpayers $25 million is false.

Answer: 0"
335,"Explanation: The claim that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003 is false. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), American oil production reached its highest level in 2019, with a daily production of about 12.6 million barrels. In 2020, production decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has since rebounded. However, it has not yet reached the levels seen in 2019.

Answer: 0"
336,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the budget request for veterans in 2016 (during President Obama's term) with the appropriated amount in 1980. However, the claim does not specify whether the 1980 figure is in constant dollars or not. If the 1980 figure is not adjusted for inflation, then the claim is false because the value of money has decreased significantly over time. If the 1980 figure is in constant dollars, then the claim would need to be verified with actual data to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it does not specify whether the 1980 figure is in constant dollars or not.)"
337,"Explanation: The claim that seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality is not supported by any specific data or survey results. While polls and surveys on this topic do exist, they typically show varying levels of support, but none specifically indicate that seventy percent of New Jersey residents want marriage equality. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable based on available data.

Answer: 0"
338,"Explanation: The claim that GOP Senate nominee Darryl Glenn wants to see Ted Cruz appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
339,"Explanation: The claim that Antonin Scalia told more jokes and got more laughs than any of the other justices during oral arguments is not supported by reliable sources. While Scalia was known for his wit and humor, there is no specific evidence or widely accepted data that quantifies his jokes or laughter compared to other justices. The claim appears to be a generalization or an anecdotal observation rather than a factual statement.

Answer: 0"
340,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the World Health Organization, the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country. However, the claim that the U.S. is ranked 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality is incorrect. The U.S. ranks 46th in life expectancy and 44th in child mortality among the 195 countries and territories ranked by the World Health Organization.

Answer: 0"
341,"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is likely referring to their own efforts in growing a Facebook page for a gubernatorial race. However, without specific evidence or verification from a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the exact size of the page or the time frame in which it grew. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively proven true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
342,"Explanation: As of 2021, Ohio is one of the states that has an estate tax. The estate tax in Ohio applies to estates valued at $338,000 or more, which is indeed one of the lowest thresholds in the nation. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
343,"Explanation: The claim states that ""The state ethics commission took absolutely the same percent of cuts as most other state agencies. They were somewhere in the 7 percent range same as the governors office."" To verify this claim, we would need to check the official records or reports from the state ethics commission and other relevant state agencies to confirm the percentage of cuts they received. Without specific data or official sources, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
344,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal, known as the ""Better Way"" plan, does include cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and defense spending over the long term. While it is true that the proposal does not cut these programs in the next two to three years, it does propose significant changes to these programs over a longer period. Additionally, the proposal does not cut the debt in three years; instead, it aims to reduce the debt over a longer period. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
345,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton's immigration platform during her 2016 presidential campaign did not propose ""totally open borders."" Instead, her platform focused on comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, increased border security, and a focus on legal immigration. The term ""open borders"" is often used to describe a policy that allows anyone to enter a country without restriction, which is not what Clinton's platform advocated.

Answer: 0"
346,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the situation in Iraq, but it lacks specific data or sources to support it.

Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame for ""last year,"" which could be interpreted differently depending on the context.

Answer: 0"
347,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Barack Obama had one of the worst attendance records in the Senate is false. According to the Washington Post, Sen. Obama had an attendance record of 96.4% during his time in the Senate, which was above average. The claim likely confuses Sen. Obama's attendance with that of Sen. Marco Rubio, who had a lower attendance record.

Answer: 0"
348,"Explanation: The claim that state legislators quietly shifted $2 billion from education to road building in 2013 is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim. The shift of funds from education to road building would typically be a significant and public event, as it would involve budgetary changes that would be reported in official documents and news outlets. The lack of any supporting evidence or official records makes this claim unfounded.

Answer: 0"
349,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, San Antonio has had an African American woman mayor, but it is not accurate to say that San Antonio is now the largest city in the United States ever to have an African American woman mayor. This claim is false because there have been other cities with African American women mayors that are larger in population than San Antonio.

Answer: 0"
350,"Explanation: Travis County is located in Texas, USA. The surrounding counties are not all red (Republican-leaning). For example, Travis County itself is a Democratic-leaning county, and there are other counties in the area that are also Democratic-leaning. Therefore, the claim that Travis County is surrounded by red counties is false.

Answer: 0"
351,"Explanation: The claim that the national healthcare law (Affordable Care Act) puts federal bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor is a common misconception. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) primarily aims to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs, not to create a new layer of bureaucracy between patients and their doctors. The law does introduce some new regulations and oversight, but these are primarily aimed at ensuring that insurance companies and healthcare providers operate in the best interests of patients. The law does not replace the patient-doctor relationship with federal bureaucrats.

Answer: 0"
352,"Explanation: The claim that she is co-owner of Celilo Group Media cannot be verified without additional information. Celilo Group Media is a private company, and ownership information is not publicly disclosed. Therefore, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this claim based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
353,"Explanation: The claim that 3 million votes in a presidential election were cast by illegal aliens is false. U.S. law prohibits non-citizens from voting in federal elections.

Answer: 0"
354,"Explanation: The claim that ""the stories from women saying he groped or forced himself on them largely have been debunked"" is false. There have been numerous credible allegations of sexual misconduct against various public figures, including Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, and others. While some allegations may have been debunked or proven false, many others have been substantiated through investigations, legal proceedings, and testimonies. The claim oversimplifies and misrepresents the complexity of these cases.

Answer: 0"
355,"Explanation: The claim that tuition in Virginia colleges has doubled in the last 10 years is not accurate. According to the College Board's annual report on tuition and fees, the average tuition and fees for in-state students at public colleges in Virginia increased by about 30% from the 2011-2012 academic year to the 2021-2022 academic year. This is a significant increase, but it is not a 100% increase.

Answer: 0"
356,"Explanation: The claim is false. The decision to cancel the trademark of the Washington Redskins was made by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), not Barack Obama. The USPTO canceled the trademark in 2020 due to the team's name being deemed offensive to Native Americans. Barack Obama was not involved in this decision.

Answer: 0"
357,"Explanation: The claim that the Iran nuclear deal involved the U.S. giving Iran $150 billion and receiving nothing in return is a simplification and an exaggeration. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a multilateral agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States), and the European Union. The agreement involved Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The $150 billion figure refers to the estimated value of Iran's frozen assets abroad, which were released to Iran as part of the agreement. However, the claim that the U.S. received nothing in return is false, as the agreement was designed to address Iran's nuclear program and the lifting of sanctions was a key part of that agreement.

Answer: 0"
358,"Explanation: The claim ""Says Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar"" is highly unlikely to be true. Consuming 16 packs of sugar in a short period is an extremely large amount and would be dangerous for a child's health. It is not a typical or realistic scenario.

Answer: 0"
359,"Explanation: The claim that young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who did not serve is generally true. According to various studies and reports, such as those from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans, particularly younger ones, often face higher unemployment rates compared to their civilian counterparts. This is often attributed to factors like the transition from military to civilian life, lack of civilian work experience, and the challenges of reintegrating into the workforce.

Answer: 1"
360,"Explanation: The claim that Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst promises to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA is false. Joni Ernst has not made such promises.

Similarly, she has expressed concerns about the EPA's regulations but has not promised to abolish the agency.

Answer: 0"
361,"Explanation: The claim that a politician has never asked for nor received a single earmark or pork barrel project for their state is difficult to verify without specific evidence. Earmarks and pork barrel projects are often allocated through complex political processes, and it's possible for a politician to deny involvement in such projects. However, without concrete evidence or a public record of such denials, it's challenging to definitively judge the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
362,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to bring in thousands of refugees to America from all around the world without any kind of security screening is false.

She has not advocated for the admission of refugees without any security screening.

Answer: 0"
363,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country is likely false. While Georgia does experience a significant number of lightning strikes due to its geographical location and climate, it is not necessarily the state with the highest number of insurance claims for lightning strikes. The number of claims can vary based on factors such as population density, insurance coverage, and the specific insurance companies operating in the state. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country.

Answer: 0"
364,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax, is not accurate. While it is true that Ohio has seen a decline in the number of family farms, the rate of loss is not as high as claimed. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of farms in Ohio has been declining, but the rate of loss is not as severe as the claim suggests. Additionally, inheritance tax is not a significant factor in the loss of family farms.

Answer: 0"
365,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. President does not have the authority to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval. The Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by Congress in 2001 and 2002 provides the legal basis for military action in Iraq and Syria, but it does not give the President the authority to initiate strikes without congressional approval.

Answer: 0"
366,"Explanation: The claim that 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence in 2011 is false. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the number of homicides in New Jersey in 2011 was 147, not 269. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual data.

Answer: 0"
367,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a famous quote by Benjamin Franklin, which is often attributed to him. The original quote is: ""Nothing is certain but death and taxes."" The claim adds a humorous twist by suggesting that even Franklin did not foresee the tax man visiting on the day of one's death. This is a creative interpretation of the quote and does not change the original meaning or the fact that Franklin did indeed say something similar. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
368,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government reneging on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin caused about $240 million in extra costs in the 2013-15 state budget is false. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported that the state received $1.2 billion in federal Medicaid funds in 2013 and $1.3 billion in 2014, with no significant reduction in federal funding during the 2013-15 period. The $240 million figure appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual data.

Answer: 0"
369,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a federal program that provides health coverage to children from low-income families. The income limit for CHIP varies by state, but it is typically for families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level. In 2021, this means a family of four could earn up to $51,000 per year and still qualify for CHIP. Therefore, a family making $60,000 a year would not qualify for CHIP.

Answer: 0"
370,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that the current minimum wage in New Jersey is insufficient to lift a single-parent family out of poverty. However, the poverty threshold for a family of three (which is the typical composition of a single-parent family with one child) in New Jersey is $26,500 per year. The current minimum wage in New Jersey is $15 per hour, which translates to approximately $31,200 per year for a full-time worker. Therefore, a single-parent family earning the minimum wage at a full-time job would not live in poverty.

Answer: 0"
371,"Explanation: The claim that the president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for the country is false. The speech in question was delivered by President Barack Obama in 2009, and it was a speech aimed at improving relations with the Muslim world. While it did address some historical grievances, it was not an apology for the country as a whole. The speech was more about setting a new tone and direction for U.S. foreign policy.

Answer: 0"
372,"Explanation: The claim that ""two-thirds of our economy is a consumer economy"" is not accurate. The consumer economy refers to the portion of the economy that is driven by consumer spending. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending accounts for about 68% of the U.S. economy, not two-thirds. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
373,"Explanation: The Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette are both basketball teams, but they are not directly comparable in terms of age. The Milwaukee Bucks are a professional basketball team that was founded in 1968, while Marquette is a college basketball team that was founded in 1977. The claim that the Milwaukee Bucks are younger than the Marquette team is false because the Marquette team is a college team and the Milwaukee Bucks are a professional team. The age of the teams is not directly comparable as they are not the same type of team.

Answer: 1"
375,"Explanation: The claim that NATO hasn't provided enough troops to Afghanistan because they are still angry about the U.S. going into Iraq is a misinterpretation of the situation. The decision to deploy troops to Afghanistan and the number of troops allocated is primarily based on strategic military assessments and political considerations, not as a response to residual anger from the Iraq War. NATO's involvement in Afghanistan is a separate and distinct mission from its involvement in Iraq.

Answer: 0"
376,"Explanation: The claim that the unemployment insurance trust fund is broke and that there is over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government is false. The unemployment insurance trust fund is a federal fund that provides benefits to workers who are unemployed. The fund is not broke, and it does not have a debt to the federal government. The fund is currently solvent and has a balance of over $200 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

Answer: 0"
377,"Explanation: The claim is false. Paul Ryan, a former Speaker of the House, did not vote for any bill that would force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees. The bill in question, the Equality Act, was introduced by Congressman David Cicilline and not by Teddy Kennedy. Additionally, Paul Ryan did not vote for the Equality Act, as he was not a member of Congress at the time it was introduced.

Answer: 0"
378,"Explanation: The claim that ""The vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country"" is a statement made by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.

Answer: 0"
382,"Explanation: The claim that there is not much evidence to suggest that people have contributed to global warming or can do very much to change anything is false. There is overwhelming scientific consensus that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly contributed to global warming. Additionally, numerous studies and reports from organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlight the impact of human actions on the climate and the potential for individuals and societies to mitigate these effects through various actions such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and adopting sustainable practices.

Answer: 0"
383,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by former President Barack Obama during a speech at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2016.

422,"Explanation: The claim that the healthcare bill will subsidize families of four that make more than $80,000 a year is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, provides subsidies for individuals and families with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL). For a family of four, this means an income of up to $104,800 in 2021. Subsidies are not provided for families with incomes above this threshold.

Answer: 0"
423,"Explanation: The claim that an estimate of an $18 billion budget gap in Texas is a number ""just reached up in the air and grabbed"" is false. Budget gaps are typically calculated based on various economic indicators, revenue projections, and spending plans. These estimates are usually the result of detailed analysis and data-driven processes, not arbitrary guesses. The $18 billion figure is likely based on a combination of economic forecasts, state revenue projections, and budgetary needs.

424,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific event that occurred in the past. In 2012, Mitt Romney did not run for U.S. Senate. He ran for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2012. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
425,"Explanation: The claim states that 37% of Central Falls retired police officers and firefighters are out on disability pensions, while in most municipalities, about 5% of retirees collect disability pensions. This claim is comparing a specific percentage for Central Falls to a general percentage for most municipalities. Without specific data or sources to support the 37% figure for Central Falls, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim. However, the general statement about the 5% figure for most municipalities is a common statistic and is often used in discussions about disability pensions among retirees.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false because the 37% figure for Central Falls is not supported by specific data or sources.)"
426,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific percentage of early voters in the 2008 election. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Pew Research Center, or other reputable election data providers. However, without specific data or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without a reliable source.)"
427,"Explanation: The claim that ""ObamaCare charges the IRS with implementing"" is false. The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) does not directly charge the IRS with implementing the law. Instead, the IRS is responsible for administering and enforcing certain provisions of the law, such as the individual mandate and the employer mandate, but it is not tasked with implementing the entire law. The implementation of the law is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

Answer: 0"
428,"Explanation: Brewpubs are typically allowed to sell growlers of their beer to customers. A growler is a reusable container that customers can fill with beer to take home. Many states in the U.S. allow brewpubs to sell growlers, provided they follow certain regulations, such as labeling and proper storage. Therefore, the claim that brewpubs cannot sell growlers of their beer to customers is false.

Answer: 0"
429,"Explanation: The claim about the Block Island Wind Farm potentially leading to a 40% estimated drop in Block Island electric rates is based on a study conducted by the University of Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Center. The study suggests that the wind farm could reduce electricity costs for Block Island residents by up to 40%. This claim is supported by credible sources and is not a misrepresentation of facts.

Answer: 1"
430,"Explanation: The claim that there are over 300 million firearms in the United States is an exaggeration. According to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center, about 30% of American adults own a firearm. Assuming an adult population of around 250 million, this would mean approximately 75 million adults own firearms. However, this number does not account for the fact that some people own multiple firearms, and it does not include children or other individuals who may own firearms. Therefore, the claim that there are over 300 million firearms in the country is an overestimation.

Answer: 0"
431,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government has allocated a total of $1.9 trillion for the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which includes the stimulus plan. As of the latest reports, the majority of the funds have been spent or allocated. The remaining funds are not necessarily unspent but are being held for future use or are in the process of being allocated. The claim that there is still about $400 billion or $500 billion unspent is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
432,"Explanation: The claim states that the Pink Pony club in DeKalb County has never been cited for any violation of an ordinance or state law. To verify this claim, I would need to check the official records of the DeKalb County government or the Pink Pony club itself. Without access to these records, I cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, if the claim is made by a reliable source or if there is no evidence to the contrary, it could be considered true.

434,"Explanation: The claim is false. Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell, and President Obama all held consistent positions on the nuclear option throughout their careers. The nuclear option refers to a parliamentary procedure that allows a simple majority to override a filibuster, and it was used to confirm Supreme Court nominees and other presidential appointments. Harry Reid, as Senate Majority Leader, was a strong advocate for the nuclear option, and Mitch McConnell, as Senate Majority Leader, was also a proponent of it. President Obama supported the nuclear option to confirm his nominees. The claim that they changed their positions is inaccurate.

435,"Explanation: The claim about David Jolly refusing to cut spending for a national greenhouse in D.C. is false. David Jolly is a former U.S. Representative from Virginia, and there is no record of him refusing to cut spending for a national greenhouse in D.C. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his political stance.

Answer: 0"
436,"Explanation: The claim is based on a comparison of the wealth of the Walton family, which is estimated to be around $200 billion, with the wealth of the bottom 40 percent of American people. According to a 2021 report by the Federal Reserve, the median net worth of American households is around $100,000. The bottom 40 percent of Americans have a combined wealth of around $1.5 trillion. Therefore, the claim that the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of American people is false.

Answer: 0"
438,"Explanation: Sarah Palin served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009. Barack Obama served as a U.S. Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. During this time, Obama was indeed a community organizer before his political career. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
439,"Explanation: The claim that a 9-9-9 tax reform plan is not regressive is based on the specifics of the plan. A regressive tax system is one where the tax burden is higher for lower-income individuals relative to their income. The 9-9-9 tax reform plan, proposed by some politicians, suggests a flat tax rate of 9% for income, 9% for sales, and 9% for capital gains. While this plan simplifies the tax code, it is generally considered regressive because it does not account for the ability to pay and can disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who spend a larger portion of their income on consumption.

Answer: 0"

441,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a maximum age limit of 112 years for active Social Security numbers. However, the SSA does not issue Social Security numbers to individuals who are 112 years old or older. The SSA only issues Social Security numbers to individuals who are alive and have not yet reached the maximum age limit. Therefore, it is not possible for there to be 6.5 million people with active Social Security numbers who are 112 years old or older.

Answer: 0"
442,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did use the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" in his speeches and statements. For example, in a 2015 speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, he said, ""We are the first nation to make the words 'liberty' and 'justice' more than just words."" He also used the phrase in a 2016 speech at the Pentagon. The claim that nobody in the administration would say these words is also false, as various officials, including the President himself, used the phrase.

Answer: 0"
443,"Explanation: The claim that ""more than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women"" is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2020, women made up about 48.5% of all minimum-wage workers. This percentage is significantly lower than the 64% stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
444,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, introduced by President Obama, expanded access to health insurance but did not establish a single-payer system or government-run healthcare for all.

It did not plan for the government to eventually run all healthcare in the country.

Answer: 0"
445,"Explanation: The claim that Ryan Sittons company accepted over $650,000 in Obama stimulus dollars is false. There is no evidence or credible source that supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
447,"Explanation: The claim is false. The amendment in question, known as the ""Use of Force"" amendment, does indeed change existing rules of engagement for American service members. It specifies that military members may use deadly force in certain situations, such as when they reasonably believe that doing so is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or others. This is a significant change from the previous rules, which were more restrictive. Therefore, the claim that the amendment does nothing to change existing rules of engagement is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
448,"Explanation: The claim ""Sometimes I was the only no vote on the entire board"" is subjective and cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence. It is a personal statement that could be true or false depending on the specific circumstances and the individual's role in the board. Without concrete information or proof, it is impossible to definitively judge the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
449,"Explanation: The claim that we can fix our roads without raising taxes is generally false. Road maintenance and repair require significant funding, which often comes from taxes. While there may be some potential for cost savings through efficiency improvements, innovative funding mechanisms, or public-private partnerships, the primary source of funding for road infrastructure is typically tax revenue. Therefore, the claim that we can fix our roads without raising taxes is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
450,"Explanation: The claim that Obama couldn't have afforded his home without Rezko's help is false. Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama purchased their home in Chicago in 2005, before he became a U.S. Senator. The home was purchased for $1.65 million, and they paid for it with their own funds. The claim that Rezko, a businessman and political donor, helped Obama afford the home is a misinterpretation of the facts. Rezko was involved in a political scandal in Illinois, but there is no evidence to suggest that he provided financial assistance to the Obamas for their home purchase.

Answer: 0"
451,"Explanation: The claim suggests that former President Barack Obama did not condemn left-wing attacks on General David Petraeus, despite casting other ""important votes"" earlier and later in the day. However, the claim does not provide any specific details or sources to support this assertion. Without concrete evidence or context, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
452,"Explanation: The claim that the Clintons charge the Secret Service $10,000 monthly rent for the use of a Secret Service residence is false. The Secret Service does not charge the Clintons for the use of their residence. The Secret Service provides security for the Clintons, and the cost of their residence is covered by the federal government. The claim about the rent being equal to their mortgage payment is also false, as the Clintons do not pay a mortgage for the Secret Service residence.

Answer: 0"
453,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), also known as the ""death panel"" by critics, was created under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to recommend changes to Medicare payments to reduce the program's costs. However, the IPAB does not have the authority to interfere with the treatment decisions between patients and their doctors. The IPAB's role is limited to making recommendations to Congress about Medicare payments, not to dictate medical treatment. The term ""death panel"" was a misnomer used by critics to suggest that the IPAB would make decisions about end-of-life care, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
454,"Explanation: The claim that David Cicilline is the 5th most liberal person in the House of Representatives is not verifiable with the information provided.

455,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world is false. As of 2021, the U.S. has a federal corporate tax rate of 21%, which is lower than many other countries. For example, the corporate tax rate in France is 25%, in Germany it is 25%, and in Japan it is 30.62%. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world at 35% is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
456,"Explanation: The claim states that the United States doubled its commitment to fighting global AIDS in the first 17 months of the current president's term. The original commitment was $500 million per year. To double this commitment, the new commitment would need to be $1 billion per year. However, the claim does not specify the new commitment amount or provide any evidence to support the doubling of the commitment. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
457,"Explanation: The claim is referring to the ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows individuals to use deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm. The claim suggests that this law has led to ""horrific events"" and that lives have been put into these situations. While it is true that the law has been criticized for contributing to an increase in gun violence and controversial shootings, the claim itself is vague and does not provide specific examples or evidence to support the assertion that the law has directly caused ""horrific events"" or put lives into these situations. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and lacks specific evidence to support its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
458,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of anti-women's choice bills introduced in the first half of the current session to the last three General Assemblies. To verify this claim, one would need to check the number of bills introduced in each of the specified periods.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have specific data for the number of people apprehended since January 1, 2023. However, the claim is specific and quantifiable, and it's possible to verify this information through official sources such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or the U.S. Border Patrol.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as I cannot verify the exact number without specific data for the current year.)"
460,"Explanation: The claim that Jim Renacci tried to avoid paying taxes on nearly $14 million that he made is false. Jim Renacci, a former U.S. Representative from Ohio, has not been accused or convicted of tax evasion. There is no credible evidence or sources supporting this claim.

Answer: 0"
463,"Explanation: The claim about the unemployment rate among blacks in Texas being 9.5% and wages falling for black workers since 2000 is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for blacks in Texas in 2021 was around 8.5%, which is indeed higher than the rate for whites (around 4.5%). However, the claim that the unemployment rate is ""far more than double white unemployment"" is misleading because it suggests a much higher disparity than the actual figures. Additionally, the claim about wages falling for black workers since 2000 is not supported by data. In fact, wages for black workers have generally increased over time, although the rate of increase has been slower compared to other groups.

Answer: 0"
464,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no evidence or credible source indicating that U.S. Rep.

Answer: 0"
465,"Explanation: The claim is true. In Florida, a proposed revenue smart cap would indeed require a 60 percent vote by citizens to impose a new tax, fee, license, fine, charge, or assessment. This is part of the state's constitutional amendment process, which aims to give citizens more control over tax increases.

Answer: 1"
466,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fourteen million Americans mortgages are greater than the value of their homes"" is false. This statement is misleading because it implies that a significant number of Americans are underwater on their mortgages, which is not accurate. According to various sources, the number of Americans with mortgages greater than the value of their homes is much lower. For instance, as of 2021, the number of underwater mortgages in the U.S. was around 1.5 million, which is significantly less than the 14 million stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
467,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of March 2023, the total number of jobs created in the United States since the start of the Biden administration is approximately 12.5 million. This number is significantly higher than the 850,000 jobs claimed. Therefore, the claim that more than 850,000 jobs have been created, more than all the other states combined, is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
468,"Explanation: The claim that 20 million illegals voting would lead to the repeal of the Second Amendment is a false and misleading statement. The Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms, is a part of the U.S. Constitution and cannot be repealed by a simple majority vote. Additionally, the claim that 20 million illegals would vote is not supported by any credible evidence or data. The actual number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is estimated to be around 10.5 million, and even if they were all to vote, it would not be enough to repeal the Second Amendment.

Answer: 0"
469,"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood has illegally sold baby parts is a misrepresentation of a 2015 controversy. The claim originated from a series of videos released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress, which alleged that Planned Parenthood was selling fetal tissue for profit. However, multiple investigations, including those by the FBI and the Department of Justice, found no evidence of illegal activity. The videos were later found to have been heavily edited and misleading. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
470,"Explanation: While toothaches can be extremely painful and uncomfortable, they are not typically life-threatening. Toothaches are usually caused by dental issues such as cavities, infections, or impacted wisdom teeth. While severe infections can lead to complications like sepsis, which can be life-threatening, this is not a common outcome of a typical toothache. Therefore, the claim that ""anyone can die of a toothache"" is an exaggeration and is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
471,"Explanation: The claim that Jim Frishe wanted to tax us for doing our taxes through an accountant is false. Jim Frishe is a fictional character from the TV show ""The Office."" The show is a mockumentary-style sitcom and does not contain real-life political or tax-related discussions. Therefore, any claims about Jim Frishe's views on taxes are not based on factual information.

473,"Explanation: The claim is false. Jason Carter is a former governor of Georgia, and Nathan Deal was the governor of Georgia from 2011 to 2019. Jason Carter served as governor from 2019 to 2023. Therefore, it is not possible for Jason Carter to have backed Nathan Deal's budgets, as they were not in office at the same time. Additionally, the claim that Jason Carter accuses the governor of underfunding education is not supported by any known statements or actions from Jason Carter.

Answer: 0"
474,"Explanation: The claim is true. Oil drilling off the coast of Florida has been a topic of debate and controversy for many years. The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has been involved in leasing areas for oil and gas exploration and development in the Gulf of Mexico, which includes waters off the coast of Florida. However, it's important to note that the specific areas and the extent of drilling activities can vary and are subject to environmental and regulatory considerations.

Answer: 1"
475,"Explanation: The claim that sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their healthcare bills is not supported by reliable data. While healthcare costs can be a significant burden for small businesses, the specific percentage cited is not accurate. According to various studies and reports, the primary reasons for small business closures include economic conditions, lack of capital, and competition, rather than healthcare costs alone.

Answer: 0"
476,"Explanation: The claim that Jesus was an undocumented immigrant is false.

Ann Kuster, a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, has been a strong advocate for healthcare reform, but her stance does not involve a government takeover of healthcare that would result in Medicare losing $700 billion. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of her actual positions and the impact of healthcare reform on Medicare.

Answer: 0"
479,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has indeed led to a reduction in the number of insurance options in some states. This is primarily due to the consolidation of insurance markets, as some insurers have exited the market or reduced their offerings. However, the claim that it is ""four or five states"" is not accurate. The number of states affected varies, and it's not limited to just four or five. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
480,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted women the right to vote, was ratified in 1920, not 1915. Additionally, the amendment was passed by the U.S. Congress and ratified by the states, not by a referendum in New Jersey.

Therefore, the claim that he supported ending the Medicare guarantee is false.

Answer: 0"
482,"Explanation: The claim is false. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a massive spending bill, was indeed rushed through Congress in a short period, but it was not signed by President Obama until February 17, 2009, after it had been on his desk for three days.

484,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fleeing Syria, a million children are now refugees"" is an exaggeration. While it is true that there are many children who have fled Syria due to the ongoing conflict, the number of children refugees is not exactly one million. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of 2021, there are approximately 2.5 million Syrian refugee children. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
485,"Explanation: The claim is true. In the United States, federal law requires that military personnel be paid on time, regardless of government shutdowns. However, during a shutdown, the military is funded by the previous year's appropriations, and personnel are paid retroactively once the shutdown ends and appropriations are available. This means that while military personnel continue to serve and accrue pay, they will not actually receive their pay until the shutdown is over and the government has appropriated funds.

Answer: 1"
486,"Explanation: The claim that Rand Paul's speech on Gattaca was totally ripped off of Wikipedia is false. While it is possible that some elements of the speech may have been inspired by information found on Wikipedia, it is not accurate to say that the entire speech was copied from Wikipedia. Speeches often draw from a variety of sources, including personal knowledge, research, and other public sources, and are typically not verbatim copies of any single source.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, the median household income in the United States was $68,703. While it's true that a large percentage of families earn less than $250,000, the claim that 98 percent do so is an exaggeration. The actual percentage of families earning less than $250,000 is closer to 90 percent.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of Americans working in 2016 (when Obama was president) was 155.0 million, and in 2020, it was 153.7 million.

Answer: 1"
494,"Explanation: The claim is false. There are many people and organizations in various fields who are against amnesty for illegal immigrants. For example, the Center for Immigration Studies, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, and many conservative politicians and advocacy groups have publicly opposed amnesty.

498,"Explanation: The claim that the entire state of Florida led the nation last year with the most prison inmates committing tax fraud is false. While Florida does have a high number of prison inmates, it is not accurate to say that it led the nation in tax fraud specifically. The claim is misleading and lacks specific data to support it.

Answer: 0"
499,"Explanation: The claim suggests that most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums and it would still be half the national average. This claim is false because it implies a specific comparison between state employees' premiums and the national average, which is not provided in the claim. Without specific data or context, it is impossible to verify the claim's accuracy.

501,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2019, the median household income in Texas was $64,000. While Texas has a high concentration of wealthy individuals, particularly in the oil and gas industry, the majority of Texans do not fall into the millionaire category. The claim that ""most Texans aren't millionaires"" is supported by statistical data.

Answer: 1"
502,"Explanation: The claim is false. The weight of a single $1 bill is approximately 1 gram. The national debt of $14.1 trillion would require 14,100,000,000,000 bills. The weight of these bills would be 14,100,000,000,000 grams, or 14,100,000,000 kilograms. An aircraft carrier typically weighs around 100,000 tons (90,718,474 kilograms). Therefore, the weight of the bills would be approximately 155 aircraft carriers, not 136.

Answer: 0"
503,"Explanation: The claim that the Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country under Scott Walker is not accurate. According to a 2018 report by the Wisconsin Policy Forum, Wisconsin's middle class has been shrinking, but it is not the fastest rate among all states. The report also noted that Wisconsin's middle class has been shrinking at a similar rate to other states in the Midwest. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
504,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the per-student spending in Virginia in 2008 with the current spending. According to the Virginia Department of Education, the state's per-student spending in 2008 was approximately $10,000. In recent years, the per-student spending has been around $12,000 to $13,000. Therefore, the claim that Virginia spends less per student today than in 2008 is false.

Answer: 0"
505,"Explanation: The claim that the economic impact of Atlanta's 2000 Super Bowl was $292 million is false. The actual economic impact of the Super Bowl in Atlanta in 2000 was estimated to be around $300 million, not $292 million. This information is based on reports from the time and subsequent economic impact studies.

Answer: 0"
506,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of people who hunt and fish in Texas with the total attendance of the Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets games. According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold in Texas annually is around 1.5 million. On the other hand, the combined attendance of the four sports teams (Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets) is significantly lower. For example, in the 2021-2022 season, the combined attendance of these teams was approximately 3.5 million. Therefore, the claim that more people hunt and fish in Texas in a given year than attend the games of the four teams combined is false.

Answer: 0"
507,"Explanation: The claim states that there has been only one tax increase since the speaker has been in office, specifically a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area. This claim is true because it accurately reflects the tax increase that occurred during their tenure.

Answer: 1"
508,"Explanation: The claim that the profit from automated traffic enforcement cameras is going to private corporations rather than to the city or state is generally false. The revenue generated from these cameras typically goes to the city or state, which uses it for various purposes such as improving infrastructure, maintaining public services, or reducing traffic congestion. Private corporations may be involved in the installation, maintenance, or operation of these cameras, but the revenue itself is usually managed by the public entity.

Answer: 0"
509,"Explanation: The claim ""We broke. We don't have any more money"" is a subjective statement and does not provide specific details or evidence to support its truthfulness.

He has been criticized for questioning the official account of the event, but he did not deny the deaths of people involved.

Answer: 0"
511,"Explanation: The claim is made by former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. However, there is no credible evidence or record of 10 percent of the state legislature being put in jail during his tenure. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of his accomplishments.

Answer: 0"
512,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker has given back over $370,000 of his salary to the county since being elected in 2002 is false. Scott Walker served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, not since 2002. Additionally, there is no record of him giving back such a significant amount of his salary to the county.

Answer: 0"
513,"Explanation: The claim is false. The religious liberty bill proposed in the Georgia House of Representatives, known as HB 105, does not explicitly exclude corporations from claiming a religious exemption. However, the bill does not provide a blanket exemption for corporations either. It allows individuals and businesses to claim a religious exemption based on their sincerely held beliefs, but it does not specify that corporations can automatically claim this exemption. Therefore, while corporations could potentially claim a religious exemption, it is not explicitly stated in the bill that they can do so.

Answer: 0"
514,"Explanation: David Dewhurst, a former Lieutenant Governor of Texas, has been criticized for his role in budget cuts during his tenure.

Answer: 0"
515,"Explanation: The claim that there are 150 different pension plans for public workers in Rhode Island is false. According to the Rhode Island Retirement Board, there are only two pension plans for public workers: the Rhode Island Employees' Retirement System (RIERS) and the Rhode Island State Employees' Retirement System (RISE). The claim of 150 different pension plans is an exaggeration and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
516,"Explanation: The claim that a defense bill includes language that would require military hospitals to provide abortions on demand is false. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2023, which is a defense bill, does not include such language.

Answer: 0"
517,"Explanation: The claim is true. Wisconsin does not have a state law specifically prohibiting gender discrimination in pay, unlike many other states. This is due to the repeal of a 2009 law by Governor Scott Walker. Wisconsin is one of five states without such a law.

Answer: 1"
518,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the latest data from the New Jersey Department of Corrections, as of 2021, the prison population in New Jersey is approximately 40% African-American, not 61%. The state's overall African-American population is indeed around 13%, but the prison population is disproportionately higher due to various factors such as higher rates of arrest and conviction among African-Americans.

Answer: 0"
519,"Explanation: The claim is not supported by reliable statistical evidence. While it is true that some students may experience a decrease in their SAT scores when retaking the test, the claim that one third of test-takers will get a lower score is an overgeneralization and not based on established data. The College Board, which administers the SAT, does not provide specific statistics on the percentage of students who score lower on a retake. Therefore, the claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
520,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Obama has declared and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions is false. While Sen. Barack Obama did express a willingness to engage in diplomatic talks with Iran during his presidency, he did not do so without preconditions. In fact, he maintained that such talks would require Iran to meet certain conditions, such as addressing its nuclear program and regional behavior. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
521,"Explanation: The claim ""I'm proud to have had a 100 percent pro-life voting record"" is a statement that can be true or false depending on the context and the specific political positions of the individual making the claim. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting record of the individual in question. Without specific information about the individual's voting history, it is impossible to definitively determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0/1"
522,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in their monthly report on U.S. crude oil production and imports. The EIA reported that in March 2021, the U.S. produced more oil than it imported for the first time since 2002. This is a significant milestone, as it indicates a shift in the U.S.'s dependence on oil imports and a rise in domestic production.

Answer: 1"
523,"Explanation: The claim that every eligible Mexican citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram is false.

Answer: 0"
525,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that reducing obesity rates to the levels of the 1980s would significantly decrease healthcare costs, specifically for Medicare. However, this claim oversimplifies the issue. Obesity rates have been increasing due to a combination of factors, including changes in diet, physical activity, and environmental factors. Simply reducing obesity rates to 1980s levels would not necessarily lead to a trillion-dollar savings in Medicare costs. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential costs of implementing and maintaining such a reduction in obesity rates, nor does it consider the potential economic benefits of a healthier population.

Answer: 0"
526,"Explanation: Austin, Texas, does not have nonstop flights to Europe. The city is served by Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS), which offers flights to several international destinations, but none of these are nonstop flights to Europe. The claim is true.

Answer: 1"
527,"Explanation: The claim states that a 12-year council member has never chaired, vice-chaired, or led a single council committee meeting. This claim is false because it is not possible for a council member to have been in office for 12 years without having chaired, vice-chaired, or led at least one committee meeting. Council members typically have roles and responsibilities that include participating in and leading committee meetings.

Answer: 0"
528,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Supreme Court's website, six justices have been confirmed during election years since 1900. These justices include Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in 1988, the final year of the Reagan Administration.

Answer: 1"
529,"Explanation: The claim that Mexico can afford to build a wall because of its trade deficit with the United States is misleading. While it is true that Mexico has a trade deficit with the United States, this does not directly translate to Mexico having the financial resources to build a wall. The trade deficit refers to the difference between the value of imports and exports, which is influenced by various factors including trade policies, economic conditions, and consumer preferences. The cost of building a wall would be a significant investment that would need to be funded through government spending, which is not directly related to the trade deficit.

Answer: 0"
530,"Explanation: The claim that the Chicago White Sox can still get into the playoffs mathematically depends on several factors, including their remaining schedule, the performance of other teams, and the current standings. As of my last update, I don't have real-time data, but typically, teams can still mathematically make the playoffs if they have a reasonable number of games left and are within a certain number of games behind the teams in the playoff spots. However, without specific data on the current standings and remaining games, it's challenging to definitively say whether they can still make the playoffs.

Answer: 0/1"
531,"Explanation: The claim that a candidate has released their past tax returns is a common political statement. However, without specific details or evidence, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of this claim. Typically, candidates release their tax returns to build trust with voters and demonstrate transparency. If the candidate has indeed released their tax returns, this claim would be true. If not, it would be false.

Answer: 1 (assuming the candidate has released their tax returns)"
532,"Explanation: The claim that the media widely overlooked comments made by former President Bill Clinton about Hillary Clinton's concussion is false. The incident in question occurred in 2016 when Hillary Clinton collapsed at a 9/11 memorial service. The media extensively covered the incident, and Bill Clinton himself made comments about it. He stated that Hillary Clinton had a concussion and that it took her six months to recover. This information was widely reported in the media at the time. Therefore, the claim that the media overlooked this information is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
533,"Explanation: The claim that she voted against the Medicare Part D prescription drug program because it was unfunded is false. Medicare Part D was actually funded through a combination of premiums paid by beneficiaries, general revenue, and other sources. The program was not unfunded.

Answer: 0"
534,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual's position on guns and their actions as a governor, as well as receiving an endorsement from the National Rifle Association (NRA). This claim is subjective and cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence. It is a personal statement and does not provide verifiable information.

Answer: 0"
535,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the average cost per vote for a candidate to the cost per vote for another candidate. However, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the figures mentioned (two bucks a pop for the votes they got and 42 bucks for incumbent Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele). Without concrete evidence or data to back up these figures, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"

537,"Explanation: The claim is about the political stance of Mitt Romney regarding a three-state solution in Iraq. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified statement from Mitt Romney specifically stating his position on a three-state solution in Iraq. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on available information.

Answer: 0"
538,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, Missouri does not have a perfect AAA credit rating. The state's credit rating is typically lower, reflecting its fiscal health and debt levels. Texas, on the other hand, has a higher credit rating, but it is not perfect AAA either. Therefore, the claim that Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating is false.

Answer: 0"
539,"Explanation: The 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act was a proposal by President Obama to invest in infrastructure and job creation. The claim that it would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year is not accurate. The act was designed to create jobs and improve infrastructure, but the cost per family was not $1,000 a year. The claim also suggests that the act would have made no significant impact, which is a subjective statement and not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
540,"Explanation: The claim about the number of car crashes on the Columbia River Bridge is not accurate. According to the Washington State Department of Transportation, the number of crashes on the bridge is significantly lower. For instance, in 2020, there were approximately 1,000 crashes on the bridge, not 400. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not based on reliable data.

Answer: 0"
541,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Boston is 60 minutes away from Providence and offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent, while construction costs are similar. This claim is misleading because the distance between Boston and Providence is approximately 45 minutes by car, not 60. Additionally, the claim that Boston offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent is not accurate. Boston does not have a specific subsidy program for developers that allows them to charge higher rent. The claim about the skyline being dominated by cranes is true, as Boston has been experiencing significant construction activity in recent years.

Answer: 0"
542,"Explanation: The claim that notices were sent to Jews in Ukraine indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews is false. There is no credible evidence or official reports supporting this claim. The Ukrainian government has not implemented such a policy, and it would be against international human rights laws and Ukrainian laws protecting religious freedom.

Answer: 0"
543,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that the judicial system is the most underfunded in the state and that judges receive some of the richest pensions among public employees is not supported by reliable sources. The funding and pension information for the judicial system would typically be available through official government reports or budget documents, which would provide specific figures and comparisons. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: 0"
544,"Explanation: George Washington, the first President of the United States, was known for his religious beliefs and often referenced God in his speeches and writings. He frequently invoked divine guidance and providence in his public addresses. Therefore, it is accurate to say that one would likely hear him reference God, the Almighty, in his speeches.

Answer: 1"
545,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if Oregon's legislature authorizes $450 million for the Columbia River Crossing (CRC) project, it will result in Oregon bearing a greater cost responsibility than initially planned. However, the claim does not provide specific details or evidence to support this assertion. Without concrete information on the total cost of the project, the additional costs Oregon might be responsible for, or the funding sources and allocations, it is not possible to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0"
548,"Explanation: The claim that photos prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership is not accurate. Photos alone cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of ridership. To accurately assess ridership, one would need to consider data from the transit authority, such as passenger counts, ridership trends, and other relevant statistics. Photos can provide visual evidence but do not provide quantitative data.

Answer: 0"
549,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 data, Rhode Island does indeed have the highest gambling revenue per capita among all states in the U.S. This is primarily due to the state's legalized gambling industry, which includes casinos, lottery, and other forms of gambling. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
550,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that a pack-a-day smoker spends $1,650 a year on cigarettes. However, the actual cost of cigarettes can vary greatly depending on the location, brand, and tax rates. Therefore, the claim is not universally applicable and cannot be considered true without specific data on the cost of cigarettes in the context of the tax increase.

Answer: 0"
551,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher is the only working farmer currently serving in the House is false. While Rep. Fincher is a farmer, there are other members of Congress who also work in agriculture or have farming backgrounds. For example, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) is a farmer and has served in the House. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
552,"Explanation: The claim about Milwaukee police and firefighters receiving 4 percent raises annually while others receive zero or one percent raises is not accurate. Public sector employees, including police and firefighters, often have collective bargaining agreements that determine their salary increases. These agreements are typically negotiated between the unions representing the employees and the city or county governments. While it is possible for certain groups to receive higher raises, it is not accurate to say that this is a routine occurrence for all police and firefighters. The claim seems to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the actual salary negotiation process.

Answer: 0"
553,"Explanation: The claim that Disney was looking to build Disney World in Miami and was told to ""take a hike"" is false. Disney World was actually built in Orlando, Florida, not Miami. The misconception might arise from the fact that Disney initially considered building in Miami before deciding on Orlando.

Answer: 0"
554,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times is false. While John McCain did support cap and trade legislation, he did not introduce it three times. He was a co-sponsor of the Climate Security Act of 2007, which was introduced by Senator Joseph Lieberman, but he did not introduce it himself. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

Answer: 0"
555,"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Scott Walker's plan to freeze pay for state employees does not include a 5.4 percent raise for himself. This information is not accurate and is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual plan.

There is no evidence or credible source to support the claim that Susan Happ, a district attorney, took $180,000 in a shady land deal from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution. This claim appears to be a fabrication or misinformation.

Answer: 0"
557,"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 voters were turned away by Wisconsin's strict voter ID law in the 2016 presidential election is false. According to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, only about 17,000 voters were unable to cast a ballot due to the voter ID law in the 2016 election. The claim significantly overstates the number of voters affected.

Answer: 0"
558,"Explanation: The claim states that Dan Patrick was the only state senator who voted against the Veteran Entrepreneurship Program. However, without specific information about the voting record of all state senators on this particular bill, it is impossible to verify if Dan Patrick was indeed the only one to vote against it. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
559,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely known or proposed immigration legislation that provides new immigrants with taxpayer-funded cellular phones. Immigration policies typically focus on issues such as visa requirements, border control, and integration programs, but not on providing specific items like cellular phones. Therefore, this claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
560,"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigrants mow the grass around the Texas Capitol is true. There have been instances where illegal immigrants have been employed for various tasks, including landscaping, around the Texas Capitol. This is not uncommon, as many states and cities employ undocumented workers for various jobs, including maintenance and landscaping.

Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
562,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt was reduced every year under Obama is false. While the national debt did decrease in 2013, 2014, and 2015, it increased in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Therefore, the statement that the national debt was reduced every year for the last five years is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
563,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Since 1961 our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs"" is not accurate. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the total number of private-sector jobs in the U.S. has fluctuated over time, but it has not consistently been 66 million since 1961. Additionally, the claim that Republicans have created 24 million jobs and Democrats have created 42 million jobs is not supported by any reliable data source. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of job creation statistics.

Answer: 0"
564,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. tax code does not provide a tax deduction for companies that close down American factories and offices and move those jobs overseas. In fact, the U.S. tax code has provisions that can discourage companies from moving jobs overseas, such as the Foreign Tax Credit and the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, which are designed to prevent U.S. companies from avoiding U.S. taxes by moving operations abroad.

Answer: 0"
565,"Explanation: The claim that ""We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day"" is false. The baby boomer generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is a large cohort, but the number of baby boomers retiring each day is not 10,000. The actual number of baby boomers retiring each day is much lower, typically around 10,000 per day, but this is a general estimate and not an exact figure. The claim exaggerates the number significantly.

Answer: 0"
566,"Explanation: The claim that the Wisconsin Legislature raised taxes by more than $5 billion in 2009 is false. According to the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the total tax increase for the 2009-2011 biennium was approximately $1.5 billion, not $5 billion. This information is available in the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau's biennial budget reports.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 1"
568,"Explanation: The claim is false. The unemployment rate for young people (ages 16-24) in the United States was indeed high in 2009, reaching 19.6% during the Great Recession. However, the unemployment rate for young people has not decreased to 2.6% today. As of the latest data available, the unemployment rate for young people in the U.S. is around 10.3%, which is still significantly higher than the claimed 2.6%.

Answer: 0"
569,"Explanation: The claim about public-employee unions spending $30 million in Wisconsin to flip the state Senate to Democratic control is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim. The Wisconsin Election Commission and other reliable sources do not report such an expenditure.

Answer: 0"
570,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of crime statistics. The U.K. figure of over 2,000 crimes per 100,000 population is a general crime rate, while the U.S. figure of 466 violent crimes per 100,000 is a specific type of crime rate. These two figures are not directly comparable because they measure different things. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
571,"Explanation: According to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey, only 16% of Americans say they often get news from Facebook. This is significantly lower than the percentage of Americans who get news from other sources such as TV (55%), radio (24%), or news websites (29%). Therefore, the claim that ""Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook"" is false.

Answer: 0"
573,"Explanation: The claim suggests that illegal immigration would not be a significant issue if it weren't for the person making the claim. This statement is false because illegal immigration is a complex issue influenced by numerous factors, including economic conditions, political instability, and international policies. The claim implies that the issue is solely due to the actions of the person making the statement, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
574,"Explanation: The claim about a $300 million stimulus allocation to Wisconsin leading to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in every corner of the state is not verifiable with the information provided.

Without specific data or sources to back up the claim, it is not possible to confirm its accuracy.

Nancy Pelosi has been the Speaker of the House of Representatives since 2007, and during her tenure, she has had a consistent voting record.

Answer: 0"
576,"Explanation: The claim that former President Barack Obama ""supports hate-crimes expansion ... potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality"" is false. During his presidency, Obama did not support expanding hate-crime laws to include sexual orientation. In fact, he signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law in 2009, which expanded federal hate-crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. However, this law did not target churches or religious institutions for preaching about homosexuality. The claim is a misinterpretation of the law and its intent.

Answer: 0"
577,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats' budget resolution would raise America's tax bill by ""$500-billion"" is false. The budget resolution proposed by Democrats does not include a $500 billion tax increase.

Answer: 1"
580,"Explanation: The claim that the Greenlight Pinellas transportation plan involves a 300% tax increase is false. The Greenlight Pinellas plan, which is a proposed sales tax increase to fund transportation projects in Pinellas County, Florida, has been widely reported to involve a 1% sales tax increase, not a 300% increase. The 1% increase would be added to the existing 7% sales tax rate in Pinellas County.

Answer: 0"
581,"Explanation: The claim that some men serving in the Afghan armed forces have never driven a vehicle before is plausible. In many countries, including Afghanistan, not all individuals have access to or experience with driving vehicles. This could be due to various reasons such as lack of access to vehicles, lack of driving education, or cultural factors. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that some individuals in the Afghan armed forces may not have driven a vehicle before.

Therefore, the claim that the economy shrank is incorrect.

583,"Explanation: Mercury is indeed present in compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), and if a CFL bulb is broken, it can release mercury vapor. However, the amount of mercury released is very small and not enough to pose a significant health risk. The primary concern with broken CFLs is the glass shards and the potential for electrical shock. The claim that you should throw away your shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them is an exaggeration. It is recommended to clean up the broken bulb carefully, using a damp cloth to avoid inhaling mercury vapor, and to dispose of the bulb according to local regulations.

Answer: 1"
588,"Explanation: The claim that closing the tobacco loophole would save Missouri taxpayers $50,000,000 is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. The term ""tobacco loophole"" is not a widely recognized term in the context of Missouri's tax policy, and there is no specific legislation or policy that is referred to as such. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the claim that closing this hypothetical loophole would save $50,000,000 for Missouri taxpayers.

Answer: 0"
589,"Explanation: The claim that health care premiums have increased by 90 percent in New Hampshire is likely false. While health care costs have been rising in the United States, a 90 percent increase is an unusually high figure and is not supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
590,"Explanation: The claim is true. The House of Representatives has 435 members, and the speaker's statement about freshmen lawmakers and their experience aligns with the typical distribution of experience in the House. Freshmen lawmakers are those who have been elected for the first time, and they indeed account for one-third of the House. Additionally, two-thirds of the chamber having two years or less experience is a common observation in the House, as many members are elected for the first time or have limited prior experience.

Answer: 1"
591,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate was the end of his chances to win is not accurate. While the selection of Ryan did have some political implications, it did not definitively end Romney's chances of winning the election. The 2012 presidential election was highly competitive and influenced by various factors, including the economy, the candidates' performances in debates, and campaign strategies. Therefore, the claim is false.

Right-to-work laws are typically state-level initiatives, and there is no public record of Kaine being involved in such efforts.

Answer: 0"
593,"Explanation: The claim is false. The line-item veto authority allows a president to veto specific spending items in a bill, but it does not allow them to reduce the overall budget size. The claim that the budget is smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by the predecessor is not accurate, as the overall budget size is determined by the total spending approved by Congress, not by the line-item veto authority.

Answer: 0"
594,"Explanation: The claim that someone paid one dollar for a sweater at Kohls is highly unlikely. Kohls is a retail store that sells a variety of products, including clothing, but their prices are typically higher than one dollar. It's possible that the sweater was on sale or there was a mistake in the price, but it's not a common occurrence for a sweater to be priced at one dollar.

Answer: 0"
595,"Explanation: The claim is false. The combined inflation and unemployment rates in October 2011 were not the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter. In October 2011, the unemployment rate was 9.1% and the inflation rate was around 3.5%. During Ronald Reagan's presidency, the unemployment rate peaked at 10.8% in November 1982, and the inflation rate peaked at 13.5% in October 1980. Therefore, the claim that the combined rates in October 2011 were the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
596,"Explanation: The claim that black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in the states with the strictest voter ID laws, is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, black voter turnout in 2012 was 66.2%, while white voter turnout was 64.1%. Additionally, studies have shown that strict voter ID laws can disproportionately affect minority voters, potentially reducing their turnout. Therefore, the claim that black voter turnout exceeded white voter turnout in states with strict voter ID laws is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
597,"Explanation: The claim that Texas schools have had massive increases in class sizes during Rick Perry's governorship is not accurate.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, was passed in 2010. Sen. Brown voted in favor of the bill, but the deciding vote was cast by Sen. Ted Kennedy, who was the last Democrat to vote in favor of the bill, securing its passage.

Answer: 0"
601,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage is false.

Answer: 0"
602,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rudy Giuliani did not omit the September 11, 2001, strikes as a successful terrorist attack. In fact, Giuliani has repeatedly spoken about the 9/11 attacks and their impact on his life and career. He has also been critical of President Obama's handling of the Benghazi incident, which he has compared to the 9/11 attacks. Therefore, the claim that Giuliani omitted the 9/11 attacks as a successful terrorist attack is inaccurate.

The first meal consumed on the moon was by astronauts during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. The astronauts ate a variety of food items, including a meal of roasted beef, chicken, and vegetables.

This information is based on public records and police reports.

Answer: 0"
605,"Explanation: The claim about whether the state should privatize the Ohio Turnpike is a political and economic debate, not a factual statement that can be definitively judged as true or false. The decision to privatize or not privatize the Ohio Turnpike would depend on various factors such as financial needs, public opinion, and potential benefits or drawbacks of privatization. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer of 0 or 1 based on the information given.

Answer: N/A"
606,"Explanation: The claim that it costs more to shut the government down than to keep it open is generally true. Government shutdowns can lead to significant economic costs, including lost productivity, delayed payments, and increased uncertainty. For example, during the 2018-2019 shutdown, the U.S. government estimated that the shutdown cost the economy $11 billion. In contrast, keeping the government open ensures that essential services continue to function, and the economy operates smoothly. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
607,"Explanation: The claim is false. Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor and current U.S. Representative, has not been reported to have ridden on a jet belonging to a serial polluter.

609,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney's health care plan provides a $50 co-pay for abortions is false. Romney's health care plan, as proposed during his 2012 presidential campaign, did not include provisions for abortion coverage. In fact, Romney's plan was criticized for its lack of coverage for abortion services, as it did not include abortion as a covered service. Therefore, the claim that there is a $50 co-pay for abortions under Romney's health care plan is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
610,"Explanation: Trump University, which was founded by Donald Trump, was shut down in 2010 due to allegations of fraud and deceptive practices.

Answer: 0"
611,"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is out of money and is borrowing from the general treasury is not accurate. Social Security is a self-funded program that collects payroll taxes and uses them to pay benefits. It does not borrow from the general treasury. The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, but this does not mean it is out of money or borrowing from the general treasury.

Answer: 0"
612,"Explanation: The claim that under his tax plan, seniors making less than $50,000 per year won't pay any income taxes is a simplification. While it's true that some tax plans propose to reduce or eliminate taxes for low-income individuals, including seniors, the specifics of the plan would need to be examined to determine if it indeed applies to all seniors making less than $50,000 per year. The claim as stated is an oversimplification and may not accurately reflect the full scope of the tax plan.

Answer: 0"
613,"Explanation: The claim that this kind of snowstorm happens every 10 or 15 years is not accurate. Snowstorms, like any weather event, are influenced by a variety of factors including atmospheric conditions, temperature, and pressure systems.

While some areas may experience snowstorms more frequently, it is not accurate to say that they occur every 10 or 15 years.

The Koch Brothers, through their various organizations, did spend a significant amount of money in the 2016 elections, but they did not exceed the spending of the Democratic or Republican parties. The Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee both raised and spent more money than the Koch Brothers in the 2016 election cycle.

Answer: 0"
615,"Explanation: The claim that the Bush tax cuts helped to create a substantial part of the deficit is true. The Bush tax cuts, implemented in 2001 and 2003, reduced tax rates for both individuals and businesses.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has reported that the tax cuts, along with other factors, significantly increased the federal deficit.

Answer: 1"

However, without such context, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false.

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the Girl Scouts' educational goals.

Answer: 0"
618,"Explanation: The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was indeed designed to ensure that wealthy individuals and corporations pay at least a minimum amount of tax, regardless of deductions and credits they might otherwise claim. However, the AMT was not originally intended to target middle-income individuals. It was primarily aimed at high-income individuals and corporations who might use tax loopholes to reduce their tax liability. Over time, due to changes in tax law and inflation, the AMT has affected more middle-income taxpayers than originally intended.

Answer: 0"
619,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2019.

620,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton is wrong to say he mocked a disabled reporter is false. In 2016, Hillary Clinton was criticized for saying that Donald Trump was mocking a disabled reporter. However, it was later revealed that the reporter, John Hinderaker, had not been mocked by Trump.

Answer: 1"
621,"Explanation: The claim that many local governments in Wisconsin already require employees to pay 20 percent, 30 percent, or even 40 percent of their health insurance premiums is not accurate. While it is true that some employers may require employees to contribute a portion of their health insurance premiums, the percentages mentioned (20%, 30%, and 40%) are not typical or standard across Wisconsin. The actual contribution rates can vary widely, and there is no evidence to support that a significant number of local governments in Wisconsin are requiring such high percentages.

Answer: 0"
622,"Explanation: The claim that ""Today, the Social Security system is broke"" is not accurate. While it is true that the Social Security system faces long-term financial challenges, it is not currently ""broke.""

The system is currently running a surplus and is investing those funds in special-issue Treasury securities. Therefore, the claim is false.

626,"Explanation: The claim that Texas has one state inspector for every 4,500 oil and gas wells is not accurate. According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas, there are approximately 200 inspectors for the entire state. Given that there are over 200,000 active oil and gas wells in Texas, the ratio of inspectors to wells is much higher than 1:4,500.

627,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama's policies led to a 29 percent increase in grocery prices is a misattribution. While it is true that grocery prices have increased, this increase is primarily due to factors such as supply chain disruptions, inflation, and increased demand, rather than specific policies of former President Obama. The claim also incorrectly attributes the 29 percent increase in grocery prices to a single event (Barack Obama's policies) rather than acknowledging the complex interplay of multiple factors.

Answer: 0"

There is no credible evidence or historical record to support the notion that former U.S. President Barack Obama was in New York City on the same day as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and chose to go on a TV show instead of meeting with him. Both leaders had busy schedules and numerous engagements, but there is no documented instance of them being in the same city on the same day and Obama choosing to go on a TV show over a meeting with Netanyahu.

631,"Explanation: The claim that public support for abortion is going down a little bit is not accurate based on recent polling data. According to a 2021 Gallup poll, 63% of Americans support abortion in all or most cases, which is a slight increase from 56% in 2018. Additionally, a 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that 61% of Americans support legal abortion in all or most cases. These polls suggest that public support for abortion has been relatively stable or slightly increasing, not decreasing.

Answer: 0"
632,"Explanation: The claim is true. The tradition of not filling Supreme Court vacancies during a presidential election year is indeed a longstanding practice among Senate Republicans. This tradition is often referred to as the ""Biden Rule,"" named after former Vice President Joe Biden, who as a senator in 1992 advocated for not confirming Supreme Court nominees during an election year. This practice is based on the belief that the decision should be made by the incoming president, rather than the outgoing one.

Answer: 0"
635,"Explanation: The claim that we have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas is not accurate. While there have been improvements in fuel efficiency over the years, the increase has not been a doubling. For example, in the United States, the average fuel efficiency of new cars has increased from about 15 miles per gallon (mpg) in the 1970s to around 25 mpg in recent years, which is a significant improvement but not a doubling.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without additional information.)"
638,"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate, was known for his support of abortion rights. He was a co-sponsor of the ""Partial-Birth Abortion Ban"" bill in 2003, but he also supported exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life was in danger. He did not oppose a woman's right to choose in the broader sense, as he believed in the right to choose in certain circumstances. Therefore, the claim that McCain opposes a woman's right to choose is false.

Answer: 1"
642,"Explanation: The claim that unemployment in Ohio is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and that it has always been that way is not accurate. Ohio is a right-to-work state, which means that workers cannot be required to join a union as a condition of employment. The unemployment rate in Ohio can vary over time and is influenced by numerous factors, including economic conditions, industry trends, and labor market dynamics. It is not accurate to attribute higher unemployment rates solely to unionization status. Additionally, the claim that this has always been the case is not supported by historical data, as unemployment rates fluctuate based on various economic factors.

Answer: 0"

Al Sharpton did visit Ferguson following the shooting of Michael Brown, but he did not make the specific claims stated in the question.

Answer: 0"
651,"Explanation: The claim that carbon monoxide is still employed to euthanize dogs and cats in 29 Texas animal shelters is false. Carbon monoxide is not used for euthanasia in most modern animal shelters due to its potential for misuse and the availability of more humane methods such as overdose of barbiturates or other approved euthanasia drugs.

Answer: 0"
652,"Explanation: The claim that Joe Kyrillos voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion, costing New Jersey taxpayers nearly $15 billion to repay, is false. Joe Kyrillos served as a Republican Assemblyman from 1996 to 2002 and was not involved in the pension fund crisis that occurred during his tenure. The pension fund crisis in New Jersey is primarily attributed to the actions of former Governor Chris Christie and the Republican-controlled legislature during his tenure.

To accurately assess whether the number of small businesses in St. Petersburg has decreased since Mr. Foster became mayor, one would need specific data on the number of small businesses before and after his tenure. Without such data, it is impossible to determine the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0"
655,"Explanation: The claim that the person was ""totally against the war in Iraq"" and predicted that it would destabilize the Middle East is false. The person in question, George W. Bush, was the President of the United States during the Iraq War and was a strong proponent of the invasion. He did not publicly express opposition to the war or predict its destabilizing effects.

Answer: 0"
656,"Explanation: Rep. Sanford Bishop and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are both Democrats, but they represent different districts and have different voting records. While they may vote similarly on some issues, it is inaccurate to claim that Rep. Bishop votes ""similar to"" Speaker Pelosi across the board. Their voting records are distinct, and they may have different priorities and stances on various issues.

Answer: 0"
657,"Explanation: The claim is true. Crimea was indeed part of Russia until 1954, when it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as part of the Soviet Union's administrative reorganization.

Answer: 1"
658,"Explanation: The claim that Florida was the only state to go from AA to AAA in its bond rating during a specific eight-year period is not accurate. While Florida's bond rating has improved over time, it is not the only state to have achieved an AAA rating. Other states, such as New York and Massachusetts, have also received AAA ratings. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
659,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a loophole allowing members of Congress and high-powered executive branch appointees to exploit insider knowledge of the financial industry for personal profit. While it is true that insider trading is illegal and can lead to severe penalties, the claim does not provide specific evidence or examples of such a loophole. Furthermore, the U.S. government has strict regulations and oversight mechanisms in place to prevent and detect insider trading. Therefore, the claim is not supported by concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
660,"Explanation: The claim that ""we have automatic citizenship upon birth"" is true, but the statement that ""we are the only country in the world that has it"" is false. Many countries, including the United States, Canada, and several European nations, grant automatic citizenship to individuals born within their borders. However, the specific details and conditions for automatic citizenship can vary significantly from country to country.

Answer: 1"
661,"Explanation: The claim about the number of annual gun purchases in Rhode Island is not accurate. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the number of background checks conducted for firearm purchases in Rhode Island in 2020 was approximately 10,000. This number is often used as a proxy for the number of gun purchases, as each background check typically corresponds to one firearm purchase. Therefore, the claim that there are approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
662,"Explanation: The claim that Tom Cotton got paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests before Congress is not verifiable with the information provided. While it is true that Tom Cotton has worked in the private sector before entering politics, there is no specific information provided about his work for insurance companies or corporate interests, nor is there any evidence to suggest that he was paid handsomely for such work.

Answer: 0"
663,"Explanation: The claim that it will cost $50,000 per enrollee in Obamacare over the next 10 years is false. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is a complex piece of legislation that has been subject to various analyses and cost estimates. The $50,000 figure is not supported by any credible sources or official estimates. The actual costs associated with the Affordable Care Act are much lower and vary depending on the specific provisions and the overall healthcare system.

Answer: 0"
664,"Explanation: The claim is a subjective statement that expresses an opinion rather than a factual statement. The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department does not make such value judgments about neighborhoods. Instead, HUD focuses on policies and programs related to housing and urban development. Therefore, the claim is not based on any official statement from HUD and is more of a personal opinion.

Answer: 0"
665,"Explanation: The claim is about an increase in participation in early childhood programs in Virginia during a specific period when the person was governor. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as official government reports, news articles, or statements from the person in question. Without such verification, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
666,"Explanation: The claim about the next state budget beginning with a surplus of over half a billion dollars ($535 million) is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess the truth of this claim, one would need to refer to official budget reports or statements from the relevant government authority. Without such specific and credible sources, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
667,"Explanation: The claim that Bill Nelson missed 56 percent of his votes in the U.S. House when he was running for governor is false. The term ""missed votes"" typically refers to votes that a member of Congress did not cast, either because they were absent or because they chose not to vote. However, the claim does not specify the context or the type of votes that were ""missed."" Additionally, there is no credible source provided to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
668,"Explanation: The claim about Texas prosecutor Rosemary Lehmberg purchasing 72 bottles of vodka in just one store over a year is false. This claim was debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations, including Snopes and FactCheck.org. The original claim was made by a political opponent of Lehmberg and was later proven to be a fabrication. The actual number of bottles purchased was significantly lower, and the claim was used to discredit Lehmberg during her political campaign.

Answer: 0"
669,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not release a statement on the death of Robin Williams before a statement on Michael Brown. In fact, President Obama released a statement on the death of Michael Brown on August 10, 2014, and a statement on the death of Robin Williams on August 11, 2014. The order of the statements is reversed in the claim.

Answer: 0"
670,"Explanation: Ronald Reagan became a Republican in 1962, after serving as a Democrat and then an Independent. The claim that someone became a Republican sooner in their life than Ronald Reagan did in his is false because it is not possible to have become a Republican before 1962.

Answer: 0"
671,"Explanation: The claim is false. English is indeed the de facto national language of the United States, but it is not the official language. The U.S. Constitution does not designate an official language, and federal law does not require the use of English in any official capacity. In fact, the U.S. Census Bureau allows respondents to answer questions in any language they prefer. Additionally, many states and cities have laws that allow the use of multiple languages on ballots and other official documents. Therefore, the claim that making English official would prevent the use of other languages in places like New York City is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
672,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific Gallup poll result, but it's important to note that Gallup polls are not always representative of the entire population and can vary based on the sample size and methodology. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific details about the poll, such as the exact wording of the question, the sample size, or the time period of the poll. Without these details, it's difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0"
673,"Explanation: The claim that Chicago takes more guns off the streets than New York or Los Angeles is not accurate. According to data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, Chicago has a higher rate of gun-related crimes compared to New York and Los Angeles. In 2020, Chicago had 1,035 gun-related homicides, while New York had 309 and Los Angeles had 299. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
674,"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has indeed proposed the idea of building a mirror system in space to reflect sunlight back to Earth. This concept is part of a broader proposal to address climate change and improve the Earth's habitability. The idea is to place large mirrors in space to redirect sunlight towards the Earth, potentially increasing the planet's temperature and helping to mitigate the effects of global warming. While the feasibility and practicality of this idea are still subjects of scientific debate, the claim that Gingrich has suggested this is true.

Answer: 1"
675,"Explanation: The claim suggests that allowing brewpubs to sell beer in Georgia could lead to a situation where only a couple of manufacturers control the market, similar to Mexico. However, this claim is misleading and not supported by evidence. The brewpub industry is typically small-scale and local, with many independent operators. The market is not likely to consolidate into a few large manufacturers. Additionally, Georgia's alcohol laws and regulations are distinct from Mexico's, and the comparison is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
676,"Explanation: The claim is true. Commercial nuclear power has not resulted in any deaths of the American public. While there have been incidents like the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, these were not commercial nuclear power plants in the United States. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a strong safety record, and no member of the American public has been killed by commercial nuclear power.

Answer: 1"
677,"Explanation: The claim about the people in Massachusetts liking the state health care plan by a 3-1 margin is not supported by any specific data or survey results. While there may be general support for the state's health care initiatives, a 3-1 margin is a specific and quantifiable claim that requires evidence to support it. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be considered true.

Answer: 0"
678,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama is trying to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is false. President Obama did not attempt to pack the court. The term ""packing the court"" refers to the practice of increasing the number of judges on a court to influence its decisions. President Obama did not propose or attempt to increase the number of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Answer: 0"
679,"Explanation: The claim states that less than half of 1 percent of all Texas legislators who ever served draw a benefit from pensions tied to the salaries of state district judges. This claim is difficult to verify without specific data on the number of legislators who have served and the number of those who receive such pensions. However, the claim is phrased in a way that suggests a very small percentage, which is typically difficult to achieve in large groups. Therefore, without concrete evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is likely true, as it is a small fraction of the total number of legislators.

Answer: 1"
680,"Explanation: The claim that Rep. Tammy Duckworth has been a staunch supporter of expanding the spending, size, and reach of the IRS is not accurate. While Rep. Duckworth has advocated for increased funding for the IRS to improve its ability to enforce tax laws and collect revenues, she has not been a strong proponent of expanding the IRS's size or reach beyond its current scope. Her primary focus has been on improving the IRS's efficiency and effectiveness, rather than advocating for a significant increase in its size or scope.

Answer: 0"
681,"Explanation: Mitt Romney did not give away his father's inheritance. In fact, he inherited a significant amount of money from his father, George Romney, and used it to start his political career and business ventures. The claim that he gave away his father's inheritance is false.

Answer: 0"
682,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that federal bureaucrats could take over local building code enforcement due to non-compliance with energy efficiency legislation. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the role of federal regulations in local building codes. Federal energy efficiency legislation typically provides guidelines and incentives, but does not give the federal government the authority to directly enforce local building codes.

Answer: 0"
683,"Explanation: The claim that 97 percent of scientists believe humans are causing climate change has been widely cited and supported by numerous studies. The claim that this number was pulled out of thin air is false. The head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has not debunked this claim. The IPCC's reports consistently state that the consensus among scientists is that humans are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.

Answer: 0"
684,"Explanation: The claim is false. Federal spending is not entirely discretionary. While some spending, such as defense and non-defense discretionary spending, can be adjusted annually through the budget process, mandatory spending, which includes Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, is not discretionary. These programs are funded automatically based on formulas in the law, and Congress does not have the discretion to change the law to alter these spending levels in the same way it does for discretionary spending.

Answer: 0"
685,"Explanation: The claim is false. Bernie Sanders has endorsed several candidates for various positions, including presidential candidates. The claim that the speaker is the only candidate to have endorsed Sanders is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
686,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, during his presidential campaign, Romney stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop"" by political opponents.

Answer: 1"
687,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not specify which judge or case is being referred to. It also does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
688,"Explanation: The claim that judges are using Shariah law in Dearborn, Michigan is false. Dearborn, like all other cities in the United States, operates under the U.S. legal system, which is based on common law and federal and state constitutions. There is no evidence to suggest that Shariah law is being used in Dearborn or any other city in the U.S. This claim is a misinterpretation of the fact that Dearborn has a significant Muslim population and some local businesses may operate under Islamic principles, but this does not extend to the legal system.

Answer: 0"
689,"Explanation: The claim states that John doesn't have a record in the Senate and that he has only passed four bills, all of which are about post offices. This claim is false because it is not possible to have a record in the Senate without passing any bills. Additionally, the claim that John has only passed four bills is not accurate as it is not specified which bills were passed or the context in which they were passed.

Answer: 0"
690,"Explanation: According to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, Georgia ranks 10th among states with the highest number of uninsured people. Therefore, the claim that Georgia has the fifth-highest number of uninsured people is false.

Answer: 0"
691,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed shifted his stance on abortion over time. In the past, he has supported abortion rights, including a statement in 2012 where he said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" However, in recent years, he has become more vocal about his opposition to abortion, aligning himself with the pro-life movement. Therefore, the claim that he is now ""pro-life"" is accurate.

Answer: 1"
692,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""three companies got 90 percent of that"" is misleading. It implies that the three companies (CVS and two others) received 90% of the $35 million, which would be $31.5 million. However, the claim does not specify how much each of the three companies received, nor does it provide evidence that the two companies not located in Rhode Island received a significant portion of the $35 million. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as it stands.

Answer: 0"
693,"Explanation: The claim is false. The largest structural deficit in Wisconsin's history was in the 2011-2012 fiscal year, not two years ago. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the fiscal year 2019-2020, which had a structural deficit of $1.3 billion, but this was not the largest in Wisconsin's history.

Answer: 0"
694,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Scott allowed Republican legislators to cut his teacher pay raise proposal by 60 percent is false. In 2018, Gov. Scott proposed a $1,000 raise for teachers, but the Florida Legislature ultimately approved a $1,000 raise for teachers in the 2019-2020 school year. The proposal was not cut by 60 percent; instead, it was reduced by $500, which is a 33.33% reduction from the original proposal. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
695,"Explanation: The claim is false. The New York Times, like any other news organization, can be sued for defamation if they publish false information that harms someone's reputation. The claim that they cannot be sued for publishing false stories is incorrect. Journalists and news organizations are subject to the same legal standards as any other entity when it comes to defamation and libel.

Answer: 0"
696,"Explanation: As of 2021, the population of Fort Worth is approximately 874,000 people. The Texas Workforce Commission reported that in April 2021, Texas had a total of 1,025,000 new jobs created. Therefore, the claim that more Texans have new jobs today than the entire population of Fort Worth is true.

Answer: 1"
697,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst signed a pledge that protects tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas is false. There is no evidence or record of such a pledge. Ernst has been vocal about her support for businesses and job creation, but there is no specific pledge that aligns with the claim.

Answer: 0"
698,"Explanation: The claim states that the person was the top ROTC officer in the nation. However, without specific evidence or verification from a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the authenticity of this claim. The claim could be true, but it could also be an exaggeration or a fabrication.

Answer: 0"
699,"Explanation: The claim that Florida students take an array of standardized high-stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year is an exaggeration. While standardized testing does take up a significant amount of time in Florida schools, the 45 school days figure is not accurate. According to the Florida Department of Education, the average student in Florida spends about 20-25 days per year on standardized testing, which is a significant portion of the school year but not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
700,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Security Agency (NSA) is authorized to collect certain types of communications data, including phone calls, under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This section allows the NSA to collect ""any tangible thing"" relevant to a foreign intelligence investigation, including phone records. However, the NSA must obtain a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to collect such data. This process is different from the FISA warrant process, which is used for surveillance of individuals suspected of espionage or terrorism. Therefore, the claim that it is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans' phone calls without a specific FISA warrant is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
701,"Explanation: The claim that the United States is ""seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s"" is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other economic studies. According to these sources, income inequality in the U.S. has been increasing since the 1970s, with the top 1% of earners capturing a larger share of the total income. However, the claim that this level of inequality is greater than any time since the 1920s is not accurate. The 1920s was a period of significant income inequality, but the current level of inequality is not as high as it was during that time.

Answer: 0"
702,"Explanation: The claim that amniocentesis results more often than not in abortion in this country is false. Amniocentesis is a procedure used to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus. The results of the test are used to make informed decisions about the pregnancy, but the decision to terminate the pregnancy is not a result of the test itself. The test is performed to provide information, and the decision to terminate the pregnancy is made by the parents based on that information. Therefore, the claim that amniocentesis results more often than not in abortion is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
703,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by former U.S. President Barack Obama. The statement itself is a subjective assessment of Iran's threat level, which can vary based on political, military, and diplomatic perspectives. While Iran is not considered a superpower in the traditional sense, it does pose significant regional and international threats due to its nuclear program, support for militant groups, and geopolitical influence. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
704,"Explanation: The claim about the percentage of minimum wage workers in Rhode Island who serve as sole income earners for their family is based on a specific study or data source. To verify this claim, I would need to check the source of the data and ensure it is accurate and up-to-date. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without a reliable source.)"
705,"Explanation: The claim is false. John Boehner, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has not called for repealing the entire stimulus package, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle-class people. The claim is a misinterpretation of his stance on the stimulus package. Boehner has been critical of certain aspects of the stimulus but has not advocated for its complete repeal.

Answer: 0"
706,"Explanation: The claim that the average age of first marijuana use is 12 is false. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the average age of first marijuana use is around 18. This information is based on data from the Monitoring the Future survey, which is a long-term study of drug use among American youth.

Answer: 0"
707,"Explanation: The claim ""Ive never supported a payroll tax"" is false. The individual in question, Joe Biden, has publicly supported a payroll tax increase as part of his economic plans.

Answer: 0"
708,"Explanation: The claim is incomplete and lacks context. It does not specify who is serving out their gubernatorial term, nor does it provide any details about the term or the individual's identity. Without additional information, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
709,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two unrelated phenomena: the number of people who have seen UFOs and the approval rating of George W. Bush's presidency. These two topics are not directly related, and there is no evidence to suggest that the number of people who have seen UFOs is related to the approval rating of a former president. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
710,"Explanation: Zephyr Teachout, a political candidate, has publicly stated her opposition to Super PACs, which are political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. However, it is possible for candidates to accept donations from individuals or groups that support Super PACs, as long as the candidate does not directly benefit from the Super PAC's activities. The claim suggests that Teachout is against Super PACs but has taken money from Super PAC donors, which is a nuanced issue. Without specific evidence of Teachout directly benefiting from Super PAC funds, the claim is difficult to verify as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
711,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not say she was under attack in Bosnia and then found out it was young girls handing her flowers. This is a misinterpretation of a genuine event. In 1996, Clinton was in Bosnia and was greeted by a group of young girls who handed her flowers. She did not describe this as an attack.

Answer: 0"
712,"Explanation: The claim that drug testing for welfare recipients will save money is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies have shown that the costs of implementing drug testing programs often outweigh the savings. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other organizations have criticized drug testing programs for welfare recipients, arguing that they are ineffective and costly. Furthermore, the potential savings are often overstated, and the programs can lead to increased administrative burdens and legal challenges.

Answer: 0"
713,"Explanation: The claim states that New Hampshire's second congressional district includes two counties where at least 5% of residents are enrolled in the state's expanded Medicaid program. To verify this, I would need to check the specific enrollment data for the counties within New Hampshire's second congressional district. However, based on general information, it is known that New Hampshire has expanded Medicaid, and some counties may have higher enrollment rates. Without specific data, it is difficult to confirm the exact percentage for the two counties mentioned.

Answer: 0/1"
714,"Explanation: The claim is false. Dr. Paul, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, has voted for legislation that is not expressly authorized by the Constitution. For example, he has voted for bills related to healthcare, education, and other areas that are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. The Constitution does not provide a list of topics that Congress can or cannot legislate on, and the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress has the power to legislate on any subject not explicitly prohibited by the Constitution.

Answer: 0"
715,"Explanation: According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the dropout rate in Georgia was 7.9% in 2019, while Alabama's dropout rate was 6.8% in the same year. Therefore, Georgia's dropout rate is higher than Alabama's.

Answer: 1"
716,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama flip-flopped on warrantless wiretapping is false. During his presidential campaign, Obama criticized President George W. Bush's warrantless wiretapping program, stating that it was unconstitutional and violated privacy rights. However, after taking office, Obama continued and expanded the program, arguing that it was necessary for national security. This is a well-documented shift in policy, but it does not constitute a ""flip-flop"" in the sense of changing one's position on a specific issue.

Answer: 0"
717,"Explanation: The claim is based on a national study of 2,500 charter schools, which suggests that 20% of these schools perform better than community public schools, 40% perform worse, and the remaining 40% have no significant difference. This claim is not verifiable as it does not provide specific sources or data to support the percentages. Without concrete evidence or a reference to a specific study, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of these figures.

Answer: 0"
718,"Explanation: Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. During his presidency, he signed numerous bills into law. Some of the notable ones include the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, the claim that Barack Obama hasn't passed any bills is false.

Answer: 0"
719,"Explanation: Bernie Sanders has been a member of the U.S. Senate since 2007, and he has served in the House of Representatives from 1991 to 2007. During his time in Congress, Sanders has been known for his progressive policies and has introduced numerous amendments. However, the claim that he passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member is not accurate. Sanders has introduced many amendments, but the claim that he passed more than any other member in a Republican Congress is not supported by reliable sources or data.

720,"Explanation: The claim ""On switching parties"" is incomplete and lacks context. It does not provide enough information to determine its truthfulness. Without additional details, it is impossible to evaluate whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
721,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the job losses during the Great Recession (2007-2009) to the combined job losses of the last four recessions before it. The Great Recession resulted in a net loss of approximately 8.8 million jobs, while the combined job losses of the previous four recessions (1980-1982, 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009) were around 5.5 million jobs. Therefore, the claim that we lost more jobs in the Great Recession than the last four recessions combined is true.

Answer: 1"
722,"Explanation: The claim that Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest disparity of income in the country is not accurate. While Milwaukee does have a significant income disparity, Mequon, a suburb of Milwaukee, is generally considered to have a more affluent population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Milwaukee has a higher poverty rate and income disparity compared to Mequon. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
723,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement made by budget analysts, which is a common perspective in economic discussions. However, it is not specific enough to be definitively true or false without more context. Budget analysts often use models and projections to predict the economic impact of tax hikes and spending cuts, but their predictions can vary based on assumptions and methodologies. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false without additional specific data or context.

Answer: 0"
724,"Explanation: The claim that ""When Pakistan erupted in crisis, I spoke to Musharraf before Bush did"" is a statement made by former U.S. President George W. Bush. This claim is often used to highlight Bush's direct involvement in the situation and his immediate response to the crisis. However, the claim itself is not verifiable through independent sources and is based on Bush's own account. Without additional evidence or verification from other sources, it is difficult to definitively confirm the claim's truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
725,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, threatened to secede from the United States is false. While Perry has expressed support for Texas independence in the past, he has not made any recent threats to secede. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of Perry's past statements.

Answer: 0"
726,"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold said that with Obamacare, we could keep our doctors and our plans, and that it was rated as the Lie of the Year, is false. Russ Feingold, a former U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, did not make this statement. The claim is a misattribution of a statement made by President Obama during the 2009 healthcare reform debate. The statement was later rated as the ""Lie of the Year"" by PolitiFact, but it was not made by Russ Feingold.

Answer: 0"
727,"Explanation: The claim that Houston is home to more doctors, more nurses, and more researchers than any other place in the world is not accurate. While Houston is a major medical hub with several renowned hospitals and research institutions, it does not have the highest number of doctors, nurses, or researchers globally. For instance, cities like New York, London, and Tokyo have larger populations and more healthcare professionals. Additionally, the claim does not specify the criteria for ""more"" (e.g., per capita, total number, etc.), which makes it difficult to verify without additional context.

Answer: 0"
728,"Explanation: The claim that Bill White did not pay taxes while earning $133,600 as deputy secretary of energy is false. Tax obligations are based on income, and it is highly unlikely that a high-ranking government official would not pay taxes on their salary. Additionally, there is no credible source provided to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
729,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. tax code is 80,000 pages is often cited but is not accurate. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is indeed extensive, but the total length of the tax code, including regulations and other related documents, is estimated to be around 70,000 pages.

730,"Explanation: The claim that Fox News gave Republican senators twice the air time as Democrats during a hearing about the Islamic State is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. Fox News has not publicly reported or acknowledged such a discrepancy in air time.

Answer: 0"
732,"Explanation: The claim that speakers at the Democratic National Convention made zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS is false. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention, several speakers, including Hillary Clinton, addressed the threat of ISIS. For instance, Clinton mentioned ISIS in her acceptance speech, stating, ""We need to be clear-eyed about the threats we face. We face a global terrorist threat from ISIS and other extremist groups."" Therefore, the claim that there were zero mentions of ISIS is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
733,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details that would allow for verification. It does not provide any context, such as the name of the individual, the case details, or the jurisdiction. Without such information, it is impossible to confirm the authenticity of the claim. Additionally, there is no public record or widely recognized source that supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
734,"Explanation: The claim that the amount of interest paid on the federal debt exceeds total tax revenue is false. According to the U.S. Treasury Department's data, in fiscal year 2021, the total interest paid on the federal debt was approximately $370 billion, while total tax revenue was around $3.5 trillion. Therefore, the interest paid on the federal debt is significantly less than total tax revenue.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
736,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Supreme Court did not decide in 1982 that non-citizen children must get free K-12 education. The landmark case that addressed this issue is Plyler v. Doe (1982), where the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot deny undocumented children access to a free public education. However, the ruling did not specify that non-citizen children must get free K-12 education; it only ensured that they could not be excluded from public schools.

Answer: 0"
737,"Explanation: Donald Trump has consistently opposed a Canadian-style universal healthcare system. He has repeatedly stated his opposition to Medicare for All and has advocated for a market-based approach to healthcare.

Answer: 0"
738,"Explanation: The claim states that the Democrats' proposed budget is balanced by using more new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that the Democrats' budget is balanced solely by new tax revenue. Budgets are typically balanced by a combination of revenue and expenditure, and it is not accurate to suggest that new tax revenue is the primary or sole source of balance.

Answer: 0"
739,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton did not vote for the war in Iraq. She voted against the resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 2002. John McCain, on the other hand, voted in favor of the resolution. Therefore, the claim that Hillary Clinton ""agreed with (John McCain) on voting for the war in Iraq"" is false.

Answer: 0"
740,"Explanation: The claim that ""Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant"" is false. According to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there are 61 nuclear power plants in the United States, and the majority of these plants are located in states with large populations, such as California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. However, the population density around these plants varies, and it is not accurate to say that most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.

Answer: 0"
741,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has doubled its exports under President Barack Obama is not accurate. While exports did increase during his presidency, they did not double. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. exports increased from $1.5 trillion in 2009 to $2.3 trillion in 2016, which is an increase of about 53% over the eight years of his presidency, not a doubling.

Answer: 0"
742,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, also known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission, which was chaired by former Senator Alan Simpson and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, did not recommend converting Medicare to a voucher system. The commission's report, released in 2010, proposed a variety of reforms to Medicare, including raising the eligibility age and reducing benefits, but it did not propose a voucher system.

Answer: 0"
743,"Explanation: The claim that the last time there was a sustained surge of confidence in governments' competence was under Ronald Reagan is not accurate. While Ronald Reagan's presidency did see a period of increased confidence in the U.S. government, particularly in economic matters, this was not the last time such a surge occurred. For instance, the post-World War II era saw a significant surge in confidence in governments' competence, and more recently, the post-2008 financial crisis period has also seen a resurgence of confidence in governments' ability to manage economic recovery and stability. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
744,"Explanation: The claim that Senator Obama has never had a serious Republican challenger is false. Barack Obama, who later became the 44th President of the United States, was a Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. During his time in the Senate, he faced several Republican challengers in his 2008 Senate re-election campaign. The most notable challenger was Alan Keyes, who ran against Obama in the 2004 Senate election and again in 2008. Therefore, the claim that he has never had a serious Republican challenger is incorrect.

Hillary Clinton was not involved in the birther movement and did not start it.

Answer: 0"
746,"Explanation: The claim is difficult to verify without specific data or sources. It's important to note that budget allocations can vary greatly depending on the specific programs and initiatives funded, as well as the overall economic conditions of the state. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it's challenging to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
747,"Explanation: The claim that the InterLink at T.F. Green Airport is the closest air-rail link in the country is not accurate. While the InterLink is a notable air-rail link, there are other airports in the United States that have closer air-rail connections. For example, the Washington Dulles International Airport has a Metrorail station that is closer to the airport than the InterLink at T.F. Green Airport.

Answer: 0"
748,"Explanation: The claim that the United States alone loses more than 3,000 people a day to cancer is an exaggeration. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2020, an estimated 599,600 people in the United States died from cancer. This means that, on average, about 1,650 people die from cancer each day in the United States. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
749,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific study or data set that is not provided in the question. To verify the claim, one would need to check the latest educational rankings and collective bargaining laws for the states mentioned. However, without specific data or a reliable source, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
750,"Explanation: The claim that the Colorado caucus system for selecting Republican delegates is rigged is a complex issue that has been debated among political observers and participants. The Colorado caucus system involves local precinct meetings where voters select delegates to represent them at the county and state conventions. While there have been allegations of irregularities and concerns about the fairness of the process, there is no widely accepted evidence or consensus that the system is ""rigged"" in a way that systematically disadvantages one group or candidate. The system's rules and procedures are publicly available, and any irregularities are typically investigated by the relevant authorities.

Answer: 0"
751,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every 28 hours an unarmed black person is shot by a cop"" is a misinterpretation of a study conducted by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and the NAACP. The study found that a black person is killed by police every 28 hours, but it does not specify that the person is unarmed. The claim is often used to highlight the disproportionate impact of police violence on the black community, but it is not accurate to say that every 28 hours an unarmed black person is shot by a cop.

Answer: 0"
752,"Explanation: The claim is false. The volume of water flowing into and out of Lake Erie is not constant and does not remain at 137 billion gallons per day for inflow and 86.3 billion gallons per day for outflow. The claim also suggests a net surplus of 50 billion gallons per day, which is not accurate. The actual flow rates of water into and out of Lake Erie vary significantly based on factors such as weather patterns, seasonal changes, and human activities.

Answer: 0"
753,"Explanation: The claim states that San Antonio has seen a 67% growth in water customers in the last 25 years, but there is 0% more water used. This is contradictory because if the number of customers has increased by 67%, it would imply that more water is being used, not the same amount. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
754,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to multiple news reports and official statements, the crowd size at Trump's rally in Phoenix on June 18, 2020, was estimated to be around 15,000 to 20,000 people. This is supported by various sources, including local news outlets and independent fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
755,"Explanation: The claim that abortion services are well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is misleading. According to Planned Parenthood's own data, abortion services account for about 32% of their total services. The remaining services include contraception, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings, and other reproductive health services. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
756,"Explanation: The claim that the climate has been cooling for the last decade is false. Global temperature records show that the last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, with 2016, 2019, and 2020 being the three warmest years ever recorded. This trend is consistent with the long-term warming trend observed over the past century, primarily driven by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.

Answer: 0"
757,"Explanation: The claim about a 50% reduction in accidents and a 60% reduction in injury accidents at the rebuilt Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee is not verifiable with the information provided.

Answer: 0"
759,"Explanation: The Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian Islamist organization, has been accused of various extremist activities, including support for violence against Israel. However, it is important to note that the Brotherhood has denied these accusations and has stated that it is committed to peaceful means.

The claim is based on misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the Brotherhood's statements and actions.

Answer: 0"
760,"Explanation: The claim about the Medicaid fraud rate in Virginia being 0.47 percent is not accurate. The actual fraud rate for Medicaid in Virginia is much higher. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the fraud rate for Virginia's Medicaid program was 1.4 percent in 2019. This discrepancy suggests that the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
761,"Explanation: The claim that the presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution is false. Evolution is a well-established scientific theory that explains how species change over time. Gorillas are a species of great apes that have evolved from a common ancestor with humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos. The existence of gorillas does not contradict the theory of evolution; rather, it is a result of the evolutionary process. The claim seems to misunderstand the relationship between evolution and the diversity of species.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
766,"Explanation: The claim is false. George Allen, a former U.S. Senator from Virginia, did not vote to add $3 trillion to the federal debt. He voted to raise the debt ceiling four times, but this is a routine vote that occurs when the debt limit is reached and needs to be increased to allow the government to continue borrowing money. Additionally, he voted for the No Child Left Behind Act, which is a true statement. However, the claim that he voted to add $3 trillion to the federal debt is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
767,"Explanation: The claim that the Senate immigration bill is filled with things like rewards for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors, and Vegas casinos is false. The Senate immigration bill, known as the ""Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013,"" did not include such provisions. The bill focused on border security, legalization of undocumented immigrants, and other immigration-related reforms.

Answer: 0"
768,"Explanation: The claim that it makes no difference whether children are raised by heterosexual or homosexual parents is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex nature of family dynamics and child development. While numerous studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents in terms of emotional well-being, academic achievement, and overall development, it is not accurate to say that it makes no difference. The claim ignores the unique experiences and challenges that children in same-sex parent households may face, such as potential stigma, lack of societal acceptance, and the need for additional support. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
769,"Explanation: Wisconsin law does not prevent a candidate from removing their name from the ballot for re-election to Congress. Wisconsin Statutes § 12.01(1) allows candidates to withdraw from a primary or general election by filing a written withdrawal with the appropriate election official. Therefore, the claim that he cannot remove his name from the ballot for re-election to Congress is false.

Answer: 0"
770,"Explanation: The claim suggests that under Governor Mitt Romney's definition, Donald Trump is a small business. However, this claim is misleading because it implies a direct comparison or equivalence between Romney's definition and Trump's business status. Romney's definition of a small business typically refers to businesses with a certain number of employees or annual revenue, which does not directly apply to Trump's business empire. Trump's businesses are large corporations, not small businesses as defined by Romney's criteria.

Answer: 0"
771,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misunderstanding of the Iran nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The agreement does not limit Iran to the number of centrifuges needed for a weapon but rather limits the number of centrifuges Iran can use for its nuclear program. The agreement allows Iran to have a certain number of centrifuges for peaceful purposes, but it also includes strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
772,"Explanation: The claim is false. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama did not attack John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare.

Answer: 0"
773,"Explanation: The claim that Sarah Palin proposed a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf is false. There is no evidence or record of such a proposal by Sarah Palin.

Answer: 0"
774,"Explanation: The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) is indeed a significant contributor to water pollution in the Milwaukee area. The district's combined sewer overflows (CSOs) have been a major source of pollution in Lake Michigan, particularly during heavy rainfall events. The MMSD has been working on projects to reduce these overflows and improve water quality, but it remains a significant issue.

Answer: 1"
775,"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is solid through about 2040 without any changes whatsoever is false. The Social Security Administration has reported that the program's trust funds will be depleted by 2034, and the program will only be able to pay 75% of its benefits after that point. This is due to the increasing number of retirees and the decreasing number of workers paying into the system. The Social Security Administration has also stated that changes will be needed to ensure the program's long-term solvency.

Answer: 0"
776,"Explanation: The claim that if you are from Guatemala and are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed, is not accurate. While it is true that Mexico has strict immigration policies and illegal entry can result in detention, the claim that this automatically leads to jail time is an oversimplification. Detention centers are often used for processing and deportation, but not all individuals are jailed indefinitely. The process involves legal proceedings and the possibility of release on bail or other conditions.

Answer: 0"
777,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no significant oil drilling activity off the coast of Virginia. The U.S. has been focusing on reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy sources.

Answer: 0"
778,"Explanation: According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Texas is approximately $1.7 trillion, which makes it the second-largest economy in the United States. However, when comparing Texas to other countries, it ranks 10th in the world based on GDP. Therefore, the claim that Texas has the 15th largest economy in the world is false.

Answer: 0"
779,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about which institutions are being referred to and what their exact control over the capital is. Without specific names of institutions and clear evidence of their control over two-thirds of the capital, it is impossible to verify the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
780,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama wants to raise the lowest income tax rate from 10 to 15 percent is false. During his presidency, President Obama proposed a tax plan that included raising the top income tax rate for the wealthiest Americans, but he did not propose raising the lowest income tax rate. In fact, his administration focused on reducing the tax burden for low- and middle-income Americans.

Answer: 0"
781,"Explanation: The claim that all travelers, including babies, arriving in the U.S. by air must have a passport is false. While it is true that U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) must have a passport or other acceptable identification to enter the U.S., there are exceptions for minors. Children under 16 can enter the U.S. with a valid passport or a certified copy of their birth certificate. However, children under 16 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian who has a valid passport or other acceptable identification.

Answer: 0"
782,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual's fundraising performance and cash on hand compared to other political figures. To verify this claim, we would need access to reliable and up-to-date political fundraising data. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
785,"Explanation: The claim that tailpipe emissions rules, if fully implemented, will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit by 2050 is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. Tailpipe emissions regulations are part of broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, but their impact on temperature rise is not as precise as the claim suggests. The reduction in temperature rise would be more significant in terms of preventing further warming rather than a specific reduction of nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit by 2050.

Answer: 0"
786,"Explanation: Michael Thurmond is a former Georgia State Senator and has indeed authored legislation that has provided tax relief to Georgia's senior citizens and working families. The specific legislation he authored, known as the ""Georgia Taxpayer Relief Act,"" has resulted in significant tax reductions for these groups. The claim that this legislation has provided more than $250 million in tax relief is accurate based on the information available.

He was a member of the Kenya African National Union (KANU), a political party that was not aligned with communism. The claim is a misinformation that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
788,"Explanation: The claim states that none of the $400 million proposed by the City of Austin for road projects will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways. This claim is false because the city's proposal includes plans to add new lanes to certain congested roadways. The proposal is designed to address traffic congestion and improve mobility, which inherently involves adding new lanes to some roadways.

Answer: 0"
789,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain accused Barack Obama of ""letting infants die"" is false. During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, John McCain did criticize Barack Obama's stance on abortion, but he did not accuse him of letting infants die. The claim is a misrepresentation of McCain's actual statements.

Answer: 0"
790,"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown voted six times to raise his own pay is false. Sherrod Brown is a U.S. Senator from Ohio, and senators' salaries are set by law and are not determined by individual votes. The salary for a U.S. Senator is currently $174,000 per year, and this amount is set by Congress as a whole, not by individual senators voting on their own pay.

Answer: 0"
791,"Explanation: The claim is false. The latest unemployment numbers do not indicate that nearly 315,000 Americans have given up hope when it comes to finding a job. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports the unemployment rate, which is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The number of people who are unemployed is a subset of the labor force, and it does not include those who have given up looking for work. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the unemployment data.

Answer: 0"
792,"Explanation: The claim that the changes to Georgia's tax and fee structure are an overall tax cut is not accurate. While there may be specific tax cuts or reductions in certain areas, the overall impact on the tax burden can vary depending on individual circumstances and the specific changes made. Therefore, it is not accurate to label the entire tax and fee structure change as an overall tax cut.

Answer: 0"
793,"Explanation: The claim that gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years is based on a study conducted by the Pew Research Center. The study found that the number of gun homicides in the U.S. decreased from 18,255 in 2006 to 9,663 in 2018, a decrease of 47%. This is a significant reduction, but the claim states a 49% decrease, which is slightly inaccurate. Therefore, the claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate.

Answer: 1"
794,"Explanation: The claim that ""there's no money in Social Security"" is false. Social Security is a federal program in the United States that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible individuals. The program is funded through payroll taxes and is managed by the Social Security Administration. According to the Social Security Administration's website, the program has a significant amount of money in its trust funds, which are used to pay benefits to current beneficiaries.

Answer: 0"
795,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney and his staff purchased computer hard drives for $100,000 is false. The actual cost of the hard drives was $1,000, not $100,000. This misinformation likely stems from a misunderstanding or deliberate exaggeration of the actual cost.

Answer: 0"
796,"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 0/1"
797,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican-led softening of firearms training rules does not mean that untrained individuals would be allowed to carry guns with a state permit. The claim misrepresents the actual changes in the rules. The changes typically involve reducing the number of hours required for training or allowing for online training, but they still require some form of training before an individual can obtain a permit to carry a gun.

Answer: 0"
798,"Explanation: The claim that the study stating more than 70 percent of the traffic on the Sellwood Bridge is to/from Clackamas County has been thoroughly debunked by The Oregonian is false.

Answer: 0"
799,"Explanation: The claim that if all of the Bush-era tax cuts expire on schedule, the budget will be close to being balanced in four years, is based on a simplified economic model. However, it does not account for several factors that could affect the budget balance, such as changes in economic growth, inflation, and potential adjustments to other tax policies or spending programs. Additionally, the expiration of tax cuts would likely have a significant impact on individual and corporate tax liabilities, which could lead to economic adjustments that might not result in a balanced budget within four years. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and cannot be considered entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
800,"Explanation: The claim that children do best with a mom and a dad is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex nature of family structures and their impact on child development. Research in social sciences has shown that various family structures, including single-parent households, same-sex parent households, and blended families, can also provide a nurturing and supportive environment for children. The well-being of children is more closely tied to factors such as parental involvement, economic stability, and emotional support, rather than the specific gender composition of their parents.

Answer: 0"
801,"Explanation: The claim states that from May 5 to May 9, 1,100 soldiers committed suicide, with one suicide every 36 hours. This claim is false because it is not possible for 1,100 soldiers to commit suicide in just 5 days. The average number of soldiers committing suicide per day would be 220, which is an unrealistic and unsustainable figure. Additionally, the claim does not provide any credible source or evidence to support the statement.

Answer: 0"
802,"Explanation: The claim that you sponsored the new Buy American law is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that you have sponsored or been involved in the creation of the Buy American law.

803,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was funded through a combination of revenue sources, including a tax on high-income individuals, a tax on medical device manufacturers, and cuts to Medicare provider payments. The claim that funding the ACA without a tax hike would require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget is not supported by facts. The ACA's funding mechanisms were designed to be revenue-neutral, meaning the costs were offset by the new revenue sources.

Answer: 0"
804,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Assembly did not vote to take funding away from public schools to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools. The voucher program is funded separately from the state's general education funding, and the Assembly's budget decisions do not directly impact the funding for public schools or private voucher schools.

Answer: 0"
805,"Explanation: The claim is false. Joe Straus, who served as the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives from 2009 to 2019, was not acknowledged or thanked by Planned Parenthood for his efforts. In fact, Straus was known for his opposition to abortion rights and supported various anti-abortion measures during his tenure.

Answer: 0"
806,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been consistently lower than the national average during Walker's tenure as governor. In fact, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been below the national average since 2010, and it has not been in the top 2 for job losses.

Answer: 0"
807,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio today has the fewest number of state employees since the Reagan administration is difficult to verify without specific data.

Without concrete data or a reliable source, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0"
808,"Explanation: The claim that this is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression is based on the comparison of the current economic recovery to the period following the Great Depression. While the current recovery has been slow and uneven, it is not accurate to say it is the worst since the Great Depression. The Great Depression was characterized by a much more severe and prolonged economic downturn, with unemployment rates reaching over 25% in the United States. In contrast, the current recovery has seen unemployment rates peak at around 14.8% in April 2020 and has since been declining. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
809,"Explanation: The claim is asking whether the governor of Massachusetts should be able to appoint an interim U.S. senator. In the United States, the appointment of a U.S. senator is typically made by the state's governor, but this appointment is usually for a temporary period until a special election can be held. The claim does not specify the context or the reason for the appointment, so it is not possible to definitively say whether the governor should be able to make this appointment. However, the general practice is that governors can appoint interim senators, so the claim is not necessarily false.

Answer: 1"
810,"Explanation: The claim is false. Voting instructions provided to voters in elections typically include information about the limitations of the master lever, also known as the ""straight ticket"" option. This option allows voters to cast their vote for all candidates of a particular party with a single mark. The instructions usually specify that this option does not include all candidates or that it may not be available for all races. Therefore, the claim that there is nothing in the voting instructions about the limitations of the master lever is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
811,"Explanation: The claim ""On raising taxes"" is incomplete and lacks specific context. Without additional information about the source, the topic, or the specific tax being raised, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: N/A"
812,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) does not have a ""slush fund"" for spaying and neutering pets. The Affordable Care Act is a healthcare reform law that primarily focuses on expanding access to health insurance and improving the quality of healthcare services. There is no provision in the law that allows for the use of funds for pet spaying and neutering, nor is there any evidence to suggest that such a program has been implemented or funded through the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
813,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but misleading. During George W. Bush's administration, the U.S. experienced a significant economic downturn, including the Great Recession, which led to a loss of millions of jobs per month. However, the claim does not specify the exact time frame, which could be misleading. Under Barack Obama's administration, the U.S. did experience a period of job growth, with hundreds of thousands of jobs added per month during the recovery period. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of job growth under Obama, it is misleading in its comparison to the Bush administration without specifying the time frame.

Answer: 0"
814,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statistic about the education level of adults in Georgia. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or other reputable educational statistics databases. Without direct access to these sources, I cannot confirm the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0/1"
815,"Explanation: The claim ""On mandating health care coverage"" is incomplete and lacks specific context. It could refer to various situations, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States, which mandates health insurance coverage for most Americans, or other similar policies in different countries. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
816,"Explanation: The claim that Ron Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas is false. Ron Johnson, a former CEO of J.C. Penney and a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has been known to support various economic policies, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he voted five times for tax breaks specifically designed to help companies move jobs overseas. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his voting record.

Answer: 0"
817,"Explanation: The claim that the individual led the effort to build a new engineering campus for the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in Wauwatosa is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific mention of the individual's role in the project, and without additional context or verification, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
818,"Explanation: The claim that taxpayers pay $18,000 a month for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco is false. The U.S. House of Representatives does not provide monthly figures for individual members' district offices. The cost of maintaining a district office is typically funded through campaign funds and not directly from taxpayers. Additionally, the claim does not provide a source or citation to support the $18,000 figure.

Answer: 0"
819,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that reducing obesity rates to 1980 levels would directly translate to a trillion dollars saved in Medicare costs. However, this is a simplification that overlooks several factors. Obesity is just one of many factors contributing to healthcare costs, and reducing obesity rates would not necessarily lead to a direct trillion-dollar savings. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential costs of implementing and maintaining a program to reduce obesity rates to 1980 levels. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
820,"Explanation: The claim is about the additional cost of a surcharge on student loans. However, the claim does not specify which surcharge is being referred to, nor does it provide any context or source for the figures. Without this information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
821,"Explanation: The claim that a federal plan to expand Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over 10 years is based on a study conducted by the Florida Policy Institute. The study estimated that the expansion of Medicaid in Florida would cost the state $26 billion over a decade. However, this cost is not borne solely by Florida taxpayers; it is a shared responsibility between the federal government and the state. The federal government would cover a significant portion of the costs, with the state contributing a smaller amount. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of the total cost, it is misleading to attribute the entire $26 billion to Florida taxpayers.

Answer: 0"
822,"Explanation: The claim that African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do is supported by numerous studies and reports. For instance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics has shown that African-Americans are arrested at a higher rate than whites for similar offenses. Additionally, studies have found that African-Americans are more likely to receive harsher sentences, even for similar crimes. This disparity is often attributed to systemic biases in the criminal justice system.

Answer: 1"
823,"Explanation: Wisconsin does allow voters to change their early ballot if they realize they've made a mistake. This process is known as ""curing"" the ballot. The voter can contact their local clerk's office to request a replacement ballot. The original ballot is then voided, and the voter can cast a new one. This process is designed to ensure that voters' intentions are accurately reflected in the election results.

Answer: 1"
824,"Explanation: The claim that Kurt Schrader cast the deciding vote that failed to extend tax cuts for Oregon's middle-class families and small businesses is false. Kurt Schrader, a Democratic representative from Oregon, voted against the tax cut extension, but he did not cast the deciding vote. The deciding vote was cast by another representative, and the bill ultimately failed due to a lack of support from Democrats.

Answer: 0"
825,"Explanation: The claim about Governor Scott Walker openly backing a move to abolish the state retirement system and convert it to a 401(k)-style plan, which would reduce pensions by at least a third for current and retired public employees, is false. While Governor Walker has proposed changes to the state's retirement system, including a shift towards a 401(k)-style plan, he has not openly backed a move that would reduce pensions by at least a third. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresentation of his actual proposals.

Answer: 0"
826,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) does indeed limit the enrichment of uranium to the five recognized nuclear weapon states (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States). The treaty allows these states to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, but it also requires them to limit the spread of nuclear weapons technology to other countries. Non-nuclear weapon states are required to accept safeguards on their nuclear activities to ensure they are not developing nuclear weapons.

Answer: 1"
827,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Jeff Merkley voted six times for more debt is not accurate. As of my last update, there is no specific record of Sen. Merkley voting six times for more debt. It's important to verify such claims with reliable sources such as the official records of the U.S. Congress or reputable news outlets.

Answer: 0"
828,"Explanation: The claim that Congress has cut funding for veterans benefits over the last years is not accurate. In fact, the U.S. government has been increasing funding for veterans benefits. For instance, the VA budget has been increasing in recent years, with the 2021 budget being the largest in history. Additionally, the VA has been receiving additional funding through various legislative measures, such as the VA Mission Act and the VA Maintain Act, which aim to improve veterans' healthcare and benefits.

Answer: 0"
829,"Explanation: The claim about Siemens being unable to fill approximately 200 skilled trade positions in metro Atlanta is not verifiable with the information provided. Siemens has not publicly stated this issue, and there is no independent source confirming this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truth of this statement based on available information.

Answer: 0"
830,"Explanation: The claim that ""fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges these days can't find jobs"" is not supported by reliable data. While it is true that liberal arts graduates may face challenges in the job market, the specific percentage of 53% is not widely reported or verified by credible sources. According to various studies and reports, the unemployment rate for liberal arts graduates is generally lower than the claim suggests, and the majority of graduates do find employment, often in fields related to their interests and skills.

Answer: 0"
831,"Explanation: Delaware County is located in the central part of Ohio and does not have any waterfront property. The claim that Delaware County has more waterfront property than any other county in the state of Ohio is false.

Answer: 0"
832,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has led the nation in student fatalities caused by motorists illegally passing stopped school buses is not accurate. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Georgia does not consistently rank as the state with the highest number of student fatalities due to motorists illegally passing stopped school buses. The NHTSA's data shows that other states, such as California and Texas, have higher rates of such incidents. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
833,"Explanation: The claim is based on an estimate from Governing magazine, which is a reputable source for public policy and management news. The magazine has indeed reported that in states that have not expanded Medicaid, a significant number of rural hospitals are at risk of closing. The specific figure of 40 percent is not explicitly stated in the claim, but the general sentiment is supported by the magazine's reporting.

Answer: 1"
834,"Explanation: The claim that Florida Democrats put your Social Security number and your wife's Employment Identification Number in a mail piece is highly unlikely. There is no legitimate reason for a political party to use personal identification numbers in a mail piece, and it would be illegal and unethical to do so. Additionally, political parties typically do not have access to individuals' personal identification numbers without explicit consent.

Answer: 0"
835,"Explanation: The claim that Oregon ranks 30th in the nation with regard to its incarceration rate can be evaluated by checking the latest data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics or the Prison Policy Initiative. As of the latest available data, Oregon's incarceration rate is indeed relatively low compared to other states, but the exact ranking can vary slightly depending on the specific year and methodology used. However, the claim that Oregon ranks 30th specifically is not supported by the most recent data.

Answer: 0"
836,"Explanation: The claim that Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails is false. Jeb Bush has not released any of his emails from his time as governor of Florida. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the information available about his email releases.

Answer: 0"
837,"Explanation: The claim that ""creeping defense commitments in (the Middle East) and globally now consume over half the U.S. discretionary budget annually"" is misleading. While it is true that the U.S. spends a significant portion of its discretionary budget on defense, the claim that it consumes over half is an exaggeration. According to the latest data from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the defense budget is around 15-20% of the discretionary budget, not over half. The claim also does not specify the time period or the source of the data, making it difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
838,"Explanation: The claim is false. Politicians and corporate lobbyists do not have the power to take away an individual's right to spend their paycheck as they wish. The government can impose taxes and regulations, but these are not the same as taking away the right to spend money. The claim is a misinterpretation of the role of government and corporate influence.

Answer: 0"
839,"Explanation: The claim that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act is not accurate. While polls have shown that a majority of Latinos support the DREAM Act, the exact percentage varies. For instance, a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Latinos supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which includes the DREAM Act. However, the claim that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act is an exaggeration. Additionally, Marco Rubio has expressed support for the DREAM Act in the past, but he has also opposed certain aspects of it, such as the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Therefore, the claim that Marco Rubio opposes the DREAM Act is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
840,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005. In a speech, he said, ""If the Islamic Republic of Iran decides to use its nuclear power, it will be for the benefit of the entire world."" He did not explicitly threaten to use a nuclear weapon against Israel or the United States. The claim misrepresents his statement and exaggerates his intentions.

Answer: 0"
841,"Explanation: Bill McCollum is a former U.S. Representative from Florida, not Arizona. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2011. The claim about Bill McCollum in relation to Arizona immigration law is false because he has no direct connection to Arizona or its immigration laws.

Answer: 0"
842,"Explanation: The claim that there are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea is false.

Answer: 0"
843,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island's graduated driving license has saved hundreds of lives is not verifiable with specific data or studies. While graduated licensing programs are known to reduce crashes and fatalities among young drivers, the exact number of lives saved by Rhode Island's specific program is not provided in the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim as true based on the information given.

Answer: 0"
844,"Explanation: The claim states that the Wisconsin unemployment rate was higher than the U.S. rate during only three months when Mary Burke was state commerce secretary. To verify this claim, we would need to compare the unemployment rates for Wisconsin and the U.S. during the period when Mary Burke held the position. However, without specific data or a reliable source to cross-reference, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional data.)"
845,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia lawmakers ""fuel up for the session by feasting on wild hogs"" is a humorous and exaggerated statement. While it is possible that lawmakers might consume wild hog meat as part of their diet, the claim is not a factual representation of a common practice or official policy. It is more likely to be a humorous or satirical reference rather than a true statement about their dietary habits.

Answer: 0"
846,"Explanation: The claim states that Will Rasmussen falsely claimed he had lived in the West Linn district for about a year. Without specific evidence or context, it's difficult to definitively verify the truth of this claim. However, if the claim is made by a reliable source and is supported by evidence, it could be considered true. If the claim is made without evidence or by an unreliable source, it could be considered false.

849,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the resources of a Democratic campaign for Florida governor in the current election cycle to previous cycles. Without specific data or historical context, it's impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false. However, it's important to note that political campaigns can vary greatly in terms of resources, and it's not uncommon for campaigns to have significant resources early in the election cycle.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific data.)"
850,"Explanation: The claim about the error rates for the Fulton County elections department being well below the average is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess this claim, one would need specific data on the error rates for Fulton County and a comparison with the average error rates for other counties or the national average. Without such data, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
851,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a significant portion of prisoners are incarcerated for less than a year, and that some are locked up for not paying child support. While it is true that some people are incarcerated for short periods, the claim that ""a little less than half"" of prisoners are in for less than a year is not supported by reliable data. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2019, about 40% of state prisoners were sentenced to less than a year. However, the claim that ""we are locking them up in the state pen"" for not paying child support is misleading, as child support violations typically result in fines or other penalties, not jail time.

Answer: 0"
852,"Explanation: The Tennessee Constitution does not explicitly prohibit a state income tax. While it does not mention a state income tax, it also does not prohibit it. The Tennessee Constitution does not have a provision that directly states there should not be a state income tax.

Answer: 0"
854,"Explanation: The claim that this is the slowest job recovery since Hoover is comparing the current job recovery to the period following the Great Depression under President Herbert Hoover. The Great Depression was a severe economic crisis that lasted from 1929 to 1939, and the job recovery during that time was indeed very slow. However, the current job recovery, following the COVID-19 pandemic, has been slower than the recovery after the Great Recession of 2008, but not necessarily slower than the recovery after the Great Depression. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as it stands.

Answer: 0"
855,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, during his presidential campaign, Romney stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop"" by political opponents.

857,"Explanation: The claim that a transportation plan would make Virginia the first state in the nation to eliminate the state tax on gasoline is false. As of my last update in October 2023, no state in the United States has completely eliminated its state tax on gasoline. While some states have reduced or eliminated certain taxes, Virginia has not done so. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
858,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin women are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job is a misinterpretation of the gender wage gap. The gender wage gap refers to the difference in earnings between men and women, and it is often expressed as a percentage. In Wisconsin, the gender wage gap is approximately 81 cents on the dollar, meaning that women earn about 81% of what men earn for the same job. This is a common statistic used to illustrate the gender wage gap, but it does not mean that women are paid 81 cents for every dollar a man earns.

Answer: 0"
859,"Explanation: Steve Santarsiero is a former member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He served in the House from 2015 to 2019.

Therefore, the claim that Steve Santarsiero wrote PAs Gun Safety Law is true.

Answer: 1"
860,"Explanation: Common Core State Standards (CCSS) are not a federal mandate. They were developed by the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers, and they were adopted voluntarily by individual states. The federal government did not impose these standards on states. The misconception likely arises from the fact that the federal government provided funding and incentives for states to adopt these standards through programs like Race to the Top.

Answer: 0"
861,"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee's police chief can fire officers for ""basically no cause"" is false. In the United States, police officers, like other public employees, are typically protected by civil service laws that provide due process rights. This means that an officer cannot be fired without cause, and the process for termination must include a hearing and the opportunity for the officer to present their case. The specific laws and procedures can vary by jurisdiction, but the general principle of due process applies.

Answer: 0"
862,"Explanation: The claim that you cannot build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia is false. While it is true that Saudi Arabia is an Islamic state and the practice of Christianity is restricted, there are no outright prohibitions against building churches. However, the construction of churches is subject to strict regulations and requires special permission from the government. Additionally, there are no public Christian churches in Saudi Arabia, but private worship services can be held in homes or other private spaces with the appropriate permits.

Answer: 0"
863,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does not estimate that the average cost to every family of four from cap and trade will be $6,800 per year. The CBO has estimated the cost of a cap-and-trade program on households, but the figures are not as high as claimed. For example, in a 2019 report, the CBO estimated that a cap-and-trade program could increase the cost of living for a family of four by $1,000 to $2,000 per year, depending on the specific design of the program.

Answer: 0"
864,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal government does not spend $46,000 a year per family. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the federal government's spending on various programs. The claim also suggests that reducing spending to $30,000 per family would balance the budget, which is not accurate as the budget deficit is influenced by many factors, not just per-family spending.

Answer: 0"
865,"Explanation: The claim that the Pentagon made up the heroics of POW Jessica Lynch is false. Jessica Lynch was indeed captured and held by Iraqi forces in 2003.

The initial reports of her heroics were later corrected due to new information, but the basic facts of her capture and rescue were accurate.

Answer: 0"
866,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent is false. The U.S. has a significant military presence in Africa, with operations and bases in various countries. For instance, the U.S. has military operations in Somalia, Djibouti, Kenya, and other nations, often in support of counter-terrorism efforts and regional stability. Additionally, the U.S. has military advisors and trainers in several African countries. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
867,"Explanation: The claim is based on a projection that mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt will consume the entire budget in a few decades. While it is true that these programs are significant and their costs are projected to increase, it is not accurate to say that they will ""eclipse"" the entire budget. The U.S. budget includes many other categories, such as defense, education, and infrastructure, which are not mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame or the exact percentage of the budget that these programs will consume, making it difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
868,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the Tax Policy Center, which analyzed the impact of Donald Trump's tax plan. The study found that the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would indeed receive more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent combined. This is because the tax plan proposed by Trump included significant reductions in the top marginal tax rate and the elimination of the estate tax, which primarily benefited high-income individuals.

Answer: 1"
869,"Explanation: The claim is false. PolitiFact does not rank governors based on the number of lies they have told. Instead, they rate the accuracy of individual statements made by politicians, including governors. The claim that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin was listed as the governor who told the most lies is incorrect, as PolitiFact does not provide such a ranking. Additionally, the claim that Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of ""Lie-en Governors"" is also false, as Politifact does not use such a ranking system.

Answer: 0"
870,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's speeches to school children spread socialist ideology is false. President Obama's speeches to school children were primarily focused on encouraging students to stay in school, work hard, and pursue their dreams.

Answer: 0"
871,"Explanation: The claim that the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton's presidency was a hundred times what it was under President Ronald Reagan is false. While Bill Clinton's presidency saw significant economic growth and job creation, the claim of a hundred times the job creation and poverty reduction under Ronald Reagan is an exaggeration. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy created about 22.5 million jobs during Clinton's presidency, while under Reagan, the economy created about 16.5 million jobs. Additionally, the poverty rate decreased from 15.2% in 1993 to 12.7% in 2000 during Clinton's presidency, while under Reagan, the poverty rate decreased from 15.2% in 1980 to 12.8% in 1989. The claim of a hundred times the job creation and poverty reduction is not supported by the data.

873,"Explanation: The claim is false. John McCain, a Republican Senator and former presidential candidate, was known for his criticism of President George W. Bush on certain issues, particularly regarding the Iraq War. McCain was a strong advocate for the surge in Iraq and supported the war, but he also criticized the administration's handling of the war and its aftermath. Therefore, the claim that McCain was in total agreement and support of President Bush on the most important issues of their day is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
874,"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama did not make this specific promise during his 2008 presidential campaign.

The claim misrepresents his actual statements and the timeline of his deficit reduction plan.

Answer: 0"
875,"Explanation: The claim suggests that improving third-graders' reading skills can have a significant impact on various aspects of their lives, including graduation rates and incarceration rates. This claim is supported by numerous studies and educational research. For instance, research has shown that students who read at grade level by the end of third grade are more likely to graduate from high school and less likely to be involved in the criminal justice system. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
876,"Explanation: The claim is true. There are indeed several elected state officials who have opened their homes to children in need of loving families. This is often part of initiatives to promote adoption and foster care. For example, in some states, elected officials have participated in programs like ""Adopt a Child"" or similar initiatives to encourage more families to consider adoption.

Answer: 1"
877,"Explanation: Rhode Island is indeed one of the states that uses E-Verify, a system that allows employers to check the immigration status of their employees.

878,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of people becoming eligible for entitlement programs each day is not 10,000. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the fact that the baby boomer generation is large and many of them are reaching the age of eligibility for programs like Social Security and Medicare.

Answer: 0"
879,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has been challenged in court multiple times, but the Supreme Court has ruled on it twice. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the individual mandate was constitutional. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in California v. Texas that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but the rest of the ACA remained intact. Therefore, the claim that ""three courts have found the new health care law constitutional and two have found it unconstitutional"" is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
880,"Explanation: The claim that the proposed mine in northern Wisconsin would be built without any government oversight is false. In the United States, mining operations are subject to various regulations and oversight by federal and state agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and state departments of natural resources. Additionally, the claim that the mine would be nine miles long is not supported by any credible sources or official documents.

881,"Explanation: The claim that car insurance rates have decreased in New Jersey due to market-based solutions attracting more auto insurers is not supported by reliable data or sources. While it is true that the number of auto insurers in New Jersey has increased over the past decade, this does not necessarily correlate with a decrease in insurance rates. Insurance rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including the cost of claims, the risk profile of drivers, and regulatory environments. Without specific data or studies to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
882,"Explanation: The claim that energy companies spend 0.25 percent on research and development (RD) is not accurate. The actual percentage of revenue spent on RD by energy companies varies widely and is typically much higher than 0.25 percent.

Answer: 0"
891,"Explanation: The claim about Wisconsin's finances being on track for a budget surplus this year is based on the state's fiscal year 2021-2022 budget, which was approved in June 2021. The budget projected a surplus of $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ending in June 2022. However, this projection was made before the COVID-19 pandemic's full impact on the state's economy was known. The actual fiscal year 2021-2022 ended with a surplus of $1.1 billion, which was less than the projected surplus. Therefore, while Wisconsin did have a surplus, the claim that it is ""on track"" for a budget surplus this year is not accurate as it was based on a projection that did not fully account for the economic impact of the pandemic.

Answer: 0"
892,"Explanation: The claim that every statewide candidate drawing over 43 percent of the vote in a Republican Texas primary won the resulting runoff is not entirely accurate. While it is true that candidates who received over 43 percent of the vote in the primary often had a significant advantage in the runoff, it is not a guarantee that they would win. There have been instances where candidates with over 43 percent of the vote in the primary did not win the runoff. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

894,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. military's active-duty personnel has increased by approximately 30,000 since the current president took office in 2017. The claim of adding close to 68,000 troops is an exaggeration. The increase in the military's size is a result of the National Defense Strategy and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018, which authorized an increase in the size of the military.

Answer: 0"
895,"Explanation: President Barack Obama did raise taxes during his presidency. He signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law in 2010, which included a 3.8% tax on net investment income for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. Additionally, he implemented a 0.9% Medicare tax on wages and salaries for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. Therefore, the claim that President Obama has not raised taxes is false.

Answer: 0"
896,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump called pregnant employees an inconvenience is false. There is no credible evidence or verified statement from Donald Trump that supports this claim.

Answer: 0/1"
898,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world is not accurate. While the U.S. does have a high concentration of scientists and engineers, particularly in certain regions like Silicon Valley and the Boston area, it does not have the highest concentration globally. Countries like Israel and Singapore have higher densities of scientists and engineers per capita and per square mile. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
899,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for low- to moderate-income working individuals and families. To be eligible, individuals must meet certain criteria, including having earned income and meeting income limits. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for the EITC because they do not have a valid Social Security number, which is required to claim the credit. Additionally, the claim that they can receive up to $36,000 to $38,000 without paying a dime is misleading, as the EITC is a refundable credit, meaning it can reduce the amount of tax owed or result in a refund, but it does not provide a guaranteed amount of money without any tax liability.

Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and his support for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, are well-documented. There is no historical evidence to support the claim that Lincoln had plans to deport freed slaves to Central America. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of Lincoln's views on Reconstruction and the future of the former slaves.

Answer: 0"
905,"Explanation: The claim that subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies and that cutting these subsidies would save the U.S. government $45 billion every year is misleading. While it is true that oil and gas companies receive significant subsidies, the percentage of total federal subsidies they receive is not 88%. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), oil and gas subsidies in the U.S. are around 10% of total federal subsidies. Additionally, the claim that cutting these subsidies would save $45 billion annually is an oversimplification and not accurate. The actual savings would depend on various factors, including the specific subsidies being cut and their impact on the economy.

907,"Explanation: The claim states that $15 million dollars went to ""build a bigger, better airport"" for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska, with a population of 165. However, there is no credible source provided to verify this claim.

Therefore, without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is reasonable to conclude that this claim is false.

Answer: 0"
908,"Explanation: President Obama did not explicitly pledge to be transparent throughout the health care reform negotiations.

Answer: 0"
909,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama administration did not provide Pennsylvania with $160 million to pay for health insurance plans that cover any legal abortion. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require states to cover abortion services with federal funds. Pennsylvania, like other states, has the option to include abortion coverage in its Medicaid program, but this is a state decision and not funded by the federal government.

Answer: 0"

911,"Explanation: The claim that the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was, but needs only one-tenth of the workers, is misleading. While it is true that the steel industry has become more efficient and automated over time, leading to a decrease in the number of workers needed, the production levels have not remained constant. The steel industry has faced significant fluctuations in production due to economic cycles, trade policies, and other factors. Therefore, the claim that production levels are the same as they ever were is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
912,"Explanation: The claim that Austin is the largest city in the U.S. or Texas with no geographic representation on its city council is false.

In contrast, Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves were estimated to be around 266 billion barrels.

Answer: 0"
915,"Explanation: The claim that over half of the people who would be taxed under a millionaire surtax are small businesspeople is not accurate.

Answer: 1"
923,"Explanation: The 2005 Energy Policy Act, also known as the Energy Bill of 2005, was a significant piece of legislation that aimed to address various aspects of energy policy in the United States. While it included provisions for renewable energy, such as tax credits for wind and solar power, it also expanded the use of nuclear power and promoted the development of liquefied natural gas. Critics argue that the bill was not a significant step forward for clean, renewable energy due to its emphasis on nuclear and natural gas. Therefore, the claim that the 2005 energy bill was a big step backwards on the path to clean, renewable energy is a matter of perspective and interpretation.

Answer: 0"

929,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt is misleading. While the Affordable Care Act did increase the federal deficit in the short term, it also reduced the deficit in the long term. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the ACA would reduce the deficit by $145 billion over the 2016-2025 period. Additionally, the ACA has not significantly contributed to the national debt. The national debt is primarily driven by factors such as tax cuts, spending on defense and social programs, and economic downturns.

While the gun industry does have certain protections, such as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which limits lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers, this is not true for all businesses in America. Many industries have some form of liability protection, and the gun industry is not uniquely protected in this regard.

Such claims are often made in the context of broader investigations or reports from regulatory bodies, and they should be backed by credible sources.

937,"Explanation: The claim is a misinterpretation of a quote from President Obama. The full quote is: ""If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."" The ""somebody else"" refers to the infrastructure, laws, and institutions that enable businesses to operate, not to the hard work of the business owners themselves. The quote is often used to criticize Obama's views on business success, but it is not accurate to say that he believes success is solely the result of government and not hard work.

Answer: 0"
938,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Fox News network, like any other news organization, is subject to the same legal and ethical standards as other media outlets. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it does not give any entity the right to deliberately distort news reports.

940,"Explanation: The claim is false. The pay structure for law enforcement officers typically increases with experience and seniority, not with the duration of time spent on the force.

The pay scale is usually based on rank, experience, and other factors, not the exact duration of time spent on the force.

Answer: 0"
941,"Explanation: The claim that ""Only about a third of Texans who enroll in college graduate"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While it is true that graduation rates can vary widely, the claim does not provide specific data or context. According to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the six-year graduation rate for public universities in Texas is around 50%, and for community colleges, it is around 30%. However, these rates can vary significantly depending on the institution and the specific program of study. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate as it does not reflect the full range of graduation rates.

Answer: 0"

The total amount allocated to TARP was indeed $700 billion. However, the claim that $325 billion has been spent without purchasing any toxic assets is misleading. The $325 billion figure refers to the amount of money that was not used to purchase toxic assets, not the total amount spent. The program has been used to purchase assets, provide loans, and make investments to stabilize the financial system. Therefore, the claim is false.

According to the Institute for College Access & Success, the average student loan debt for the class of 2019 was $30,000. This is significantly lower than the hundreds of thousands of dollars suggested in the claim.

Answer: 0"
961,"Explanation: The claim that fully inflating tires can reduce oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent is not supported by expert consensus. While it is true that properly inflated tires can improve fuel efficiency, the exact percentage of reduction in oil consumption is not universally agreed upon and varies based on factors such as vehicle type, driving conditions, and tire quality. Therefore, the claim that ""every expert says"" this reduction is 3 to 4 percent is an overstatement.

Answer: 0"
962,"Explanation: The claim is false. The $1.8 billion deficit does not directly translate to a $300 cost per individual or $1,200 for families of four. The cost of a deficit is typically spread across the entire population and is not a direct per-person charge. The claim seems to be an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the financial impact of the deficit.

Answer: 0"
963,"Explanation: The claim states that new figures released by the speaker for Wisconsin job gains in 2011 are the final job numbers. However, without specific context or verification from a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm whether these figures are indeed the final job numbers for 2011. Job numbers are typically updated periodically, and there could be subsequent revisions or updates. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
964,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, in 2020, there were 93,331 drug overdose deaths in the United States, which is indeed a significant number. However, the claim that ""about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day"" is not accurate. To find the average daily deaths, you would divide the total number of deaths by the number of days in a year. In 2020, there were 365 days, so the calculation would be 93,331 / 365 ≈ 256.2 deaths per day, not 120. Additionally, the claim that ""drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms"" is also not accurate. According to the CDC, in 2020, there were 19,580 deaths from firearms, which is less than the 93,331 deaths from drug overdoses.

Answer: 0"
965,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that every Republican Senate candidate has announced their stance on the Supreme Court vacancy except for Congressman Heck. The claim is too specific and lacks verifiable sources to confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
966,"Explanation: The claim that the health care plan for members of Congress is ""no better than the janitor who cleans their offices"" is a false statement. Members of Congress, like all federal employees, are eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a comprehensive health insurance plan. This plan is considered one of the best in the country and is not comparable to the health insurance plans available to janitors or other non-federal employees. The claim is a misrepresentation of the actual benefits and quality of the health care plan available to members of Congress.

Answer: 0"
967,"Explanation: The claim is false. While Virginia has a rich history and was one of the first colonies in the United States, it is not accurate to say that it was first in ""most things except witch trials."" Virginia was the first colony to be established in the United States, but it was not the first in many other areas such as witch trials. Witch trials were more prevalent in other colonies like Salem, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.

Answer: 0"
968,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law in 2010, but it did not immediately affect small businesses or individuals in the way described. The ACA aimed to expand health insurance coverage, not reduce it. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the ACA's impact.

Answer: 0"
969,"Explanation: The claim that ""a majority of our students are trapped in underperforming schools"" is a broad statement that requires specific data and context to evaluate accurately. Without specific data or context, it is difficult to determine if this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
971,"Explanation: The claim that every family health insurance policy has a ""$900 hidden tax"" to subsidize health care costs of the uninsured is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not impose a $900 tax on all health insurance policies. Instead, it includes a tax on high-cost health plans, known as the ""Cadillac tax,"" which is not a hidden tax and only applies to certain high-cost plans. Additionally, the ACA does not use a flat tax of $900 to subsidize the uninsured; instead, it uses a combination of subsidies and other mechanisms to help reduce the cost of health insurance for low- and middle-income individuals.

Answer: 0"
972,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds during her campaign for president is false. While it is true that Clinton received significant contributions from various sources, including some from Wall Street and hedge funds, the total amount of $100 million is an exaggeration. According to Federal Election Commission records, Clinton's campaign received approximately $600 million in total contributions during her 2016 presidential campaign.

Answer: 0"
973,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama flip-flopped on withdrawing troops from Iraq is false. President Obama's policy on Iraq was consistent throughout his presidency. He announced a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2009, and the last U.S. troops left Iraq in December 2011. This policy was not changed or reversed during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
974,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush, not Tommy Thompson, prohibits the government from negotiating for better prices on prescription drugs for senior citizens. This law is part of the Medicare program and is not subject to negotiation by the government.

Answer: 0"
975,"Explanation: The claim is true. The statement is specific and verifiable. It mentions a lawsuit, an agreement, and a measurable outcome (more voters registered in the first full month after the lawsuit than in the entire previous two-year reporting period). This claim can be independently verified by checking the records of voter registrations in Rhode Island.

Answer: 1"
976,"Explanation: The claim that non-defense discretionary spending has increased by over 80 percent in the last two years is false. According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's historical tables, non-defense discretionary spending has increased by approximately 10 percent from 2019 to 2021. This increase is significantly lower than the 80 percent claimed.

Answer: 0"
977,"Explanation: The claim that two million new jobs have been created in California since 2011 is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total number of nonfarm jobs in California in 2011 was approximately 11.5 million. By 2021, the number had increased to about 13.5 million. This means that the total number of jobs created in California from 2011 to 2021 is around 2 million, but this is not a new creation since 2011 but rather a cumulative increase over the decade.

Answer: 0"
978,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific action (replacing 100,000 old toilets) and a resulting water savings (2.4 million gallons per day). However, the claim does not provide any context or source for the information, making it difficult to verify its accuracy. Without additional information or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this claim.

979,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia Republicans have mismanaged unemployment benefits is a broad statement that requires specific evidence to support. Without specific details or sources, it is difficult to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific evidence.)"
980,"Explanation: The claim that the fertilizer plant in West, Texas, had not been inspected by the state of Texas since 2006 is false. The plant was inspected by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) in 2013, just before the explosion. The TCEQ had previously inspected the plant in 2006, but the claim that no inspections had been conducted since then is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
981,"Explanation: The claim that federal regulations required changes to Georgia's driver's license renewal process is false. Federal regulations do not typically dictate the specifics of state driver's license renewal processes. Each state has its own regulations and processes for driver's license renewals, which are usually governed by state laws and not federal regulations.

Answer: 0"
982,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton invented ISIS or is responsible for ISIS is false. ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), emerged in 2014 as a result of complex political, social, and religious factors in the Middle East. The group's origins can be traced back to the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which led to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the rise of various extremist groups. Hillary Clinton, as a former Secretary of State, was involved in U.S. foreign policy during this period, but there is no credible evidence to suggest that she played a direct role in the creation or growth of ISIS. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked by fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
983,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fifty-three percent of teens in Central Falls are getting pregnant"" is likely false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the teen pregnancy rate in the United States is around 18.8 per 1,000 females aged 15-19. This rate is significantly lower than 53%. Additionally, there is no specific data available that supports a 53% pregnancy rate for teens in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

Answer: 0"
984,"Explanation: Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, has not publicly called the Arizona law a model for the nation. In fact, Romney has been critical of the Arizona law, which is often referred to as SB 1070, due to its controversial provisions related to immigration enforcement. He has expressed concerns about the law's potential to lead to racial profiling and other issues.

Answer: 0"
986,"Explanation: The claim that Snitker has been virtually ignored by the major media is subjective and depends on the definition of ""major media"" and ""ignored."" If ""major media"" refers to mainstream news outlets and ""ignored"" means receiving little to no coverage, this claim would be difficult to verify without specific examples or data. However, if ""major media"" is interpreted broadly to include various types of media coverage and ""ignored"" is interpreted as receiving minimal attention, the claim could be true or false depending on the context.

Answer: 0/1"
987,"Explanation: Miami Dade College (MDC) is a large institution with a diverse student body. According to the college's official website and various reports, MDC serves students from over 170 countries, speaking more than 100 languages. The claim that there are 86 languages spoken at Miami Dade College is an underestimation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
988,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. Capitol was built by slaves is false. While it is true that slaves were involved in the construction of the Capitol, they were not the primary workforce. The majority of the labor was done by free workers, including immigrants and skilled craftsmen. The misconception likely arises from the fact that slaves were used for some of the more menial tasks, but they did not build the Capitol.

Answer: 0"
989,"Explanation: Prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases refers to the authority of immigration officials to decide whether to initiate or pursue legal action against an individual. This discretion is used to prioritize cases based on factors such as the severity of the offense, the individual's criminal history, and the public interest. The claim is true as it accurately describes a legal concept in immigration law.

Answer: 1"
990,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate was at its lowest point during Barack Obama's presidency, reaching 3.6% in 2019. This was the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s and was significantly lower than the rates during Jimmy Carter's presidency. Therefore, the number of adults working was higher during Obama's presidency compared to Carter's.

Answer: 0"
991,"Explanation: The claim is made by a political figure, and it is a common practice for political campaigns to highlight the number of small donations they receive. However, without specific evidence or data to support the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. The claim could be true, but it is also possible that it is an exaggeration or a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0/1"
992,"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown failed to pay his own taxes three separate times is false. There is no credible evidence or sources supporting this claim.

Answer: 0"
993,"Explanation: The claim that Miami-Dade has the nation's highest-rated tap water is not accurate. While Miami-Dade County does have high-quality tap water, it is not the highest-rated in the nation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other organizations regularly publish reports on water quality, and Miami-Dade's water quality is generally considered good, but it does not consistently rank as the highest in the nation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
994,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is the only president to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare is false. While it is true that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, included provisions that reduced Medicare spending, the total reduction was not $500 billion. The ACA reduced Medicare spending by about $716 billion over 10 years, but this was achieved through a combination of cuts to Medicare providers and other measures, not a single $500 billion cut. Additionally, other presidents have also implemented policies that reduced Medicare spending, such as the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 under President Bill Clinton.

Answer: 0"
995,"Explanation: The United States is often considered one of the oldest democracies in the world, but it is not the oldest. The title of the oldest democracy is typically given to the United Kingdom, which has a history of democratic institutions dating back to the Magna Carta in 1215. The United States, while having a long history of democratic principles, was founded in 1776, which is later than the UK's democratic roots.

Answer: 0"
996,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Senate version of the health reform bill, also known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), does not include a provision that requires every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) enrolled plan to pay a minimum of $1 per month towards reproductive rights, including abortion. The AHCA does not mandate such a payment and does not expand coverage for reproductive health services in this manner.

Answer: 0"
997,"Explanation: The claim that the average person will pay $6,000 more a year under Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal is based on a specific analysis of the proposal. The $6,000 figure is derived from a study conducted by the Urban Institute, which estimated that the average person would pay $6,000 more in out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan Medicare plan. This study was widely cited in news reports and political discussions.

Answer: 1"
998,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that there are some missing service members from previous and current conflicts, the number is not in the tens of thousands. The Department of Defense's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has been working to find and repatriate missing service members, but the number of missing service members is significantly lower than the claim suggests. As of 2021, the DPAA has accounted for 81% of the 83,000 service members listed as missing from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War. The remaining 19% are still missing, which is approximately 15,600 service members.

999,"Explanation: The claim that Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in the town square and that he is a distant cousin of the speaker is not verifiable. While it is true that Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in Abilene, Kansas, there is no historical evidence to support the claim that he is a distant cousin of the speaker. Family legends can be interesting, but they are not always accurate or verifiable.

Answer: 0"
1000,"Explanation: The claim that Mike Morell testified to Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS oil fields is due to concerns about global warming is false. Mike Morell, a former CIA deputy director, did testify before Congress in 2015, but he did not make this specific claim. The testimony focused on the broader strategy against ISIS and the challenges of the conflict, but there was no mention of global warming as a reason for not bombing ISIS oil fields.

Answer: 0"
1001,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 data, Ohio ranks 10th in the nation for total exports of goods and services. This means that Ohio exports more than 41 other states, but not more than the top 9 states. Therefore, the claim is true.

The claim is a misrepresentation of the events.

Answer: 0"
1004,"Explanation: The claim that Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit is false. Nixon did not release his tax returns during his presidency, and he was not under audit at the time.

Without additional context or details, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
1007,"Explanation: The claim that gun ownership information could be recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not include provisions for the collection of gun ownership information. The ACA primarily focuses on expanding access to health insurance and improving the quality of healthcare services. There are no provisions in the ACA that authorize the collection of gun ownership data by the federal government or insurance companies.

Answer: 0"
1008,"Explanation: Exit polls are surveys conducted at polling stations to gather information about voters' choices and opinions. While exit polls can provide valuable insights into voting patterns, they are not always accurate and can be influenced by various factors such as sampling bias, non-response bias, and the wording of questions. Therefore, it is not uncommon for exit poll results to vary significantly from actual election outcomes. Additionally, the claim that Democrats receive over 70 percent of LGBT votes in federal elections is a generalization that may not hold true for all elections or regions. Specific exit poll data would be needed to verify this claim.

Answer: 0"
1009,"Explanation: The claim that Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country and includes an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons is not accurate. While Connecticut does have strict gun control laws, including an assault weapons ban, it is not accurate to say it has the fifth toughest laws in the country. Additionally, the specific number of weapons banned under the assault weapons ban is not 35.

Answer: 0"
1010,"Explanation: The claim that the Romney/Ryan budget would allow interest rates on federal student loans to double is false. The Romney/Ryan budget proposal in 2012 did not include a provision to double the interest rates on federal student loans. Instead, it proposed to cap the interest rates at 8.5% for undergraduate loans and 10.5% for graduate loans, which were lower than the rates at the time. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the budget proposal.

Answer: 0"
1011,"Explanation: The claim that the state had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, state spending in the U.S. has been increasing over the past few years, with a total of $1.1 trillion in 2019 and $1.2 trillion in 2020. There is no evidence to support the claim that $13 billion was cut from state spending over two years.

Answer: 0"
1012,"Explanation: The claim that 17 million American children had a pre-existing condition and were uninsurable when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed is false. The ACA was signed into law in 2010, and it included provisions to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions. The claim likely confuses the number of uninsured individuals with the number of people who had pre-existing conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of uninsured children in the U.S. was around 10% in 2010, which translates to approximately 7.5 million children. However, the ACA did not directly address the issue of pre-existing conditions for children specifically, as it primarily focused on adults.

Answer: 0"
1013,"Explanation: The claim that local Texas chambers of commerce were granted exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarters is false.

There is no specific exemption granted to chambers of commerce for property tax purposes.

Answer: 0"
1014,"Explanation: Preventive care, such as regular check-ups, screenings, and immunizations, can indeed save money in the long run. By catching health issues early, preventive care can prevent more costly treatments and hospitalizations. This is true for individuals, families, businesses (through health insurance and employee wellness programs), and governments (through reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity). Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
1015,"Explanation: The claim suggests that in Florida, it is not illegal for an immediate family member of state officials to benefit from legislation supported by a spouse. This claim is false because Florida, like many other states, has laws against conflicts of interest and improper influence. These laws prohibit public officials from using their position to benefit themselves or their family members. For example, Florida Statutes § 112.314 prohibits public officials from using their official position to secure a special privilege for themselves or others. Therefore, the claim that it is not illegal for an immediate family member to prosper from legislation supported by a spouse is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
1016,"Explanation: The claim that scientists are in dispute over whether being gay is a choice is false. The overwhelming consensus among scientists and medical professionals is that sexual orientation is not a choice. The American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, and other major health organizations have stated that sexual orientation is not a choice and is not a mental disorder. The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973.

Without access to these sources, I cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
1018,"Explanation: The claim that the Koch brothers want to protect tax cuts for companies that ship jobs overseas is a simplification and misrepresentation of their actual stance. The Koch brothers, through their political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, have indeed advocated for lower corporate taxes and less regulation, but their primary focus is on reducing the overall tax burden on businesses, not specifically on companies that ship jobs overseas. They have also been criticized for their role in promoting policies that can lead to job outsourcing, but it's not accurate to say they are solely focused on protecting tax cuts for such companies.

Answer: 0"
1019,"Explanation: The claim that raising income tax rates will likely reduce federal revenues is a complex economic issue that depends on various factors. While it is true that higher tax rates can discourage work and investment, leading to lower tax revenues, this is not always the case. The Laffer Curve, a theoretical representation of the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue, suggests that there is an optimal tax rate that maximizes revenue. However, the actual impact of tax rate changes on federal revenues can vary based on economic conditions, the specific tax rates being considered, and other factors such as tax avoidance strategies and economic growth.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
1020,"Explanation: The claim that there are 3 million jobs that go vacant each month in this country is not accurate.

This figure is based on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data.

Answer: 0"
1021,"Explanation: The claim that Kasich's budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder, is a simplification and exaggeration of the actual tax changes implemented during his tenure as governor of Ohio. While there were some tax increases, they were not as significant as the claim suggests. The tax increases were primarily targeted at businesses, but the impact on the middle class was not as severe as the claim implies. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
1022,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney used to favor gun control and said he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush is partially true. Romney did support certain gun control measures during his 2012 presidential campaign, such as background checks and a ban on assault weapons. However, he also supported the Second Amendment and has since shifted his stance on gun control. The claim that he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush is a simplification of his political views and does not accurately reflect his current stance.

Answer: 0"
1023,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""you don't mention it's also the biggest tax cut in history"" is a misinterpretation of the context. The Morning Joe show on MSNBC often discusses various political and economic topics, including tax policies. The claim that the biggest tax increase in history is also the biggest tax cut in history is a contradiction because a tax increase and a tax cut are opposite actions. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
1024,"Explanation: The claim that Sarah Palin had ""executive experience"" in the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) is false. While Sarah Palin was involved in the PTA as a member and later served as the president of the Wasilla High School PTA, her role was not an executive position in the broader sense. She did not hold an executive position in the PTA at the national or state level, nor did she have executive experience in the context of a corporate or political executive role.

1025,"Explanation: The claim about President Barack Obama's activities over the last six months is not verifiable and appears to be a fabrication. There is no credible source or evidence to support the claim that he has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers, while his jobs council has never met. This information is not consistent with known facts about his activities and is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
1026,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the newly created Immigration Enforcement Review Board can prosecute and jail violators with the help of the attorney general. However, the role of the Immigration Enforcement Review Board and the attorney general's involvement in immigration enforcement are not typically aligned in this manner. The board is usually responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on immigration cases, while the attorney general's role is more focused on legal policy and guidance. Prosecution and jail time for immigration violations are typically handled by immigration enforcement agencies like ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and the Department of Homeland Security, not the review board or the attorney general.

Answer: 0"
1027,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific dataset from the U.S. Congress, where men hold 80% of the seats in the 117th Congress (2021-2023). This data is accurate and can be verified through official sources such as the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The claim is specific to the 117th Congress and does not generalize to all legislatures or time periods.

Answer: 1"
1028,"Explanation: The claim that the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding is false. Automobiles contribute to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental issues, but their elimination would not be offset by a single volcanic eruption. Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of ash, gases, and heat, which can have significant environmental impacts, but they do not directly offset the specific environmental issues caused by automobiles.

Answer: 0"
1029,"Explanation: The claim that Virginia public schools have cut 5,000 positions since 2008 is false. According to the Virginia Department of Education, the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions in Virginia public schools has actually increased over the past decade. In 2008, there were approximately 100,000 FTE positions, and by 2020, this number had increased to around 110,000 FTE positions. Therefore, the claim that 5,000 positions have been cut is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
1030,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific budget proposal by a president, which is a political statement and not a verified fact. The actual impact of the budget on the deficit would depend on various factors, including the implementation of the proposed policies and the economic conditions over the next decade. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim without further context or official data.

Answer: 0"
1031,"Explanation: The claim that the 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks has been debunked is false.

1034,"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown is an ""Obama rubber stamp"" for supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan is a political statement that can be interpreted differently based on one's perspective. Sherrod Brown, a Democratic Senator from Ohio, has indeed supported various environmental policies, including cap and trade, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, labeling him as a ""rubber stamp"" for Obama and suggesting that these policies are ""job-killing"" is a simplification and a political attack. The effectiveness of cap and trade on job creation is a subject of debate among economists and policymakers, with some arguing that it can create jobs in renewable energy sectors while others argue it can lead to job losses in certain industries.

Answer: 0"
1035,"Explanation: The claim that driving on average in America this summer will save you about $70 according to Department of Energy figures is misleading. The Department of Energy's Energy Saver 101 guide does not provide specific figures for summer driving savings.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, was a federal law that expanded health insurance coverage for Americans. The claim that this is ""HillaryCare"" is a political term used to criticize the ACA, but it is not accurate to say that the ACA was a mandate for Massachusetts alone. Additionally, the claim that he doesn't want to do for America what he did for Massachusetts is a false equivalence, as the ACA was a federal law, not a state-specific mandate.

1046,"Explanation: The claim states that it has been 14 years since a president, vice president, or a member of their family has attended an Olympic event. This claim is false because there have been instances of presidents and vice presidents attending Olympic events within the past 14 years. For example, President Barack Obama attended the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and Vice President Joe Biden attended the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
1047,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not released any analysis that states the current healthcare plan would create a $6 billion surplus over 10 years.

1048,"Explanation: The claim that the health care reform bill is the largest tax increase in U.S. history is false. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) did introduce new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes were not the largest tax increase in U.S. history. The largest tax increase in U.S. history was the Revenue Act of 1942, which was implemented during World War II and significantly increased taxes to fund the war effort.

Answer: 0"
1049,"Explanation: The claim that ""more than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid"" is not accurate.

1052,"Explanation: The claim is comparing civilian casualties in Cambodia with those from American drone attacks. However, the comparison is not directly relevant because the two events are not comparable in nature. The Cambodian conflict involved a complex mix of political, military, and humanitarian factors, while American drone attacks are a specific military tactic used in various conflicts. Without specific data on the number of civilian casualties in Cambodia and the number of civilian casualties from American drone attacks, it is impossible to accurately compare the two. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
1058,"Explanation: The claim states that the opponent has ""zero times a judge, zero rulings, zero experience on the bench."" This implies that the opponent has no experience as a judge, has not made any rulings, and has never served on the bench. Without specific information about the opponent's background, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Crist has generally supported the Second Amendment, he has also expressed some nuanced views on gun control and has supported certain measures to address gun violence. For instance, he has supported background checks and other measures aimed at reducing gun-related violence. Therefore, the claim that he has never wavered in his support is an oversimplification.

Answer: 0"
1065,"Explanation: The claim is true. Oregonians for Food and Shelter is a non-profit organization that has indeed featured board members from Monsanto and Syngenta.

Answer: 1"
1066,"Explanation: The claim that health care reform will not affect veterans' benefits is generally true. Veterans' benefits are typically managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are not directly tied to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or other health care reforms. While there may be some indirect effects, such as changes in the VA's budget or the way it provides care, the core benefits like disability compensation, health care, and burial services are not directly impacted by health care reform.

Answer: 1"
1067,"Explanation: Patrick Murphy, a former U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, has been known for his positions on various issues, including Social Security and Medicare. However, there is no widely reported or verified claim that he specifically advocated for cuts to these programs.

Answer: 0"
1068,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of government spending: interest payments and national security. Interest payments are the cost of borrowing money, while national security spending includes defense, intelligence, and other related expenses. These two categories are fundamentally different and cannot be directly compared in terms of their impact on the economy or the government's budget. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 1"
1074,"Explanation: Social Security and Medicare are not a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading. In contrast, Social Security and Medicare are government-run programs funded through payroll taxes and general revenues, with benefits paid to eligible individuals based on their contributions and the program's rules. The funds are managed by the government and are not used to pay off earlier investors.

Answer: 0"
1075,"Explanation: The claim that ""the majority actually want single-payer health care"" is not universally true. Opinions on healthcare systems, including single-payer systems, vary widely among different populations and regions. While some polls and surveys suggest that a significant portion of people in certain countries or regions support single-payer healthcare, it is not accurate to say that the majority of people worldwide or in any specific country universally want it. Opinions are influenced by various factors such as political leanings, personal experiences, and cultural attitudes towards healthcare.

1076,"Explanation: The claim is about the financial reserves of Tennessee's lottery scholarship program.

Thurbert Baker, a former Georgia Attorney General, was involved in a case where a 17-year-old boy, who was not charged with a felony, was held in jail for 10 days. However, the boy was held for a misdemeanor charge, not because he didn't commit a felony. The claim misrepresents the nature of the charge and the duration of the detention.

1080,"Explanation: The claim that Fox viewers are the most consistently misinformed media viewers is a generalization and lacks specific evidence or data to support it.

The claim is also subjective and could be influenced by political bias.

Answer: 0"
1088,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require 100% of Americans to depend on federal payments or government benefits. The ACA aims to provide access to affordable health insurance for all Americans, but it does not eliminate private insurance or require everyone to rely on government benefits. Some people may still choose to purchase private insurance, and others may qualify for government assistance to help with their premiums or out-of-pocket costs. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresents the purpose and effects of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
1089,"Explanation: The claim that the sequester has already lost 1.6 million jobs is false. The sequester, which is a series of automatic spending cuts implemented in 2013, has been shown to have had a minimal impact on job growth.

The claim of 1.6 million jobs lost is not supported by credible economic data.

In the United States, projects like this typically require approval from multiple federal agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and others. The review process can indeed take several months or even years, depending on the complexity of the project and the number of agencies involved.

Answer: 1"
1093,"Explanation: The claim that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad is not irrefutable in the context of social science. While some studies suggest that children raised by two parents may have certain advantages, such as better academic performance or emotional well-being, these findings are not universally applicable and are often influenced by various factors such as socioeconomic status, family dynamics, and individual differences. Moreover, the notion that children need both parents to thrive is not supported by all research, as many children raised by single parents or in other family structures also thrive and achieve success. Therefore, the claim is not irrefutable.

Answer: 0"
1094,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a quote often attributed to George Washington, but there is no evidence that he actually said these exact words. The quote is more commonly attributed to Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in a letter to William S. Smith in 1787: ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason for the people to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, for self-preservation against tyranny in government.""

The 2008 recession had a significant impact on various sectors, and the recovery has been uneven.

The claim seems to be a generalization without specific sources or evidence.

1099,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010 and has significantly altered the healthcare landscape in the United States. It introduced several changes, including the expansion of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance marketplaces, and the requirement for most Americans to have health insurance. While the ACA has had a complex impact on the healthcare system, it has not fundamentally altered the doctor-patient relationship. The core of the relationship remains centered on the patient and their healthcare provider. The ACA has introduced new regulations and requirements, but it has not fundamentally changed the nature of the relationship between doctors and their patients.

Answer: 0"
1100,"Explanation: Austin is indeed known for its thriving startup scene, with a significant number of venture capital investments and patent filings. According to various reports and rankings, Austin is often considered one of the top cities in Texas for startups and venture capital. However, it's important to note that the claim does not specify a particular metric or time frame, so it's difficult to definitively say that Austin is ""number one"" in Texas across all categories (startups, venture capital, and patents) at any given moment. Therefore, while the claim is largely true, it's not entirely accurate to say that Austin is ""number one"" in Texas in all these categories simultaneously.

Answer: 0.5 (The claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate.)"
1101,"Explanation: The claim that stimulus money went to studying ants in Africa is false.

Additionally, the total number of people laid off in Wisconsin in 2015 was 6,685, which is indeed more than the 5,985 in 2014. However, the claim that Wisconsin's economy has ""tanked"" under Gov. Scott Walker is not supported by the data, as the unemployment rate and the number of layoffs were both lower in 2015 compared to 2014.

Answer: 0"

The federal government does offer income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs, but these are not the same as refinancing.

The federal government does not refinance student loans in the traditional sense.

The initial cost estimate for the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) was around $900 billion over 10 years, not $1.8 trillion. The $1.8 trillion figure is often cited in the context of the total cost of the healthcare system in the United States, not just the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
1109,"Explanation: The claim is false. While there are laws in various states that require independent investigations into deaths in police custody, there is no single governor who has signed such a law for the entire United States. Each state has its own laws and regulations regarding this matter, and there is no federal law that applies uniformly across all states.

Answer: 0"
1110,"Explanation: The claim that Ron Johnson opposes entirely a federal minimum wage, except perhaps for guest workers, is a simplification and misrepresentation of his actual stance. Ron Johnson, a Republican Senator from Wisconsin, has expressed opposition to a federal minimum wage increase, arguing that it should be left to the states to decide. However, he has not explicitly stated that he opposes a federal minimum wage entirely, nor has he indicated that he supports it only for guest workers. The claim is false as it distorts his position.

Answer: 0"
1111,"Explanation: The claim is a political statement that suggests increasing domestic production of fuel to ensure affordability for Americans. While it is true that increasing domestic production can potentially lower fuel prices, it is not a guaranteed solution. The claim does not provide specific details or evidence to support its assertion, making it difficult to verify its truthfulness without additional context or data.

Answer: 0"
1112,"Explanation: The claim ""For the past year, I was censored and muzzled"" is subjective and cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence. Censorship and muzzling are often used to describe situations where someone's speech or expression is restricted or suppressed, but these terms are not typically used in a general or universal context. Without specific details or evidence, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
1113,"Explanation: The claim is false. The $6,000 figure is not based on any official or reliable source. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which provided tax cuts for the wealthy, did not result in a $6,000 annual cost for middle-class families. The actual impact of the tax cuts on middle-class families varies and is not as straightforward as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
1114,"Explanation: The claim that the Texas leg of the Keystone pipeline has created 4,800 jobs in just the year it has been up and running is not accurate. The Keystone XL pipeline, which includes the Texas leg, was completed in November 2022, and it is not accurate to attribute 4,800 jobs to just the year it has been operational. The pipeline's construction phase created many jobs, but the operational phase does not typically create as many jobs. Additionally, the claim does not specify the source of the information, which is a red flag for credibility.

Answer: 0"
1115,"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was a strong advocate for border security and supported the construction of a border fence. He was a co-sponsor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. Therefore, the claim that McCain opposed the border fence is false.

Answer: 0"
1116,"Explanation: The claim that NATO has changed its policy to focus on terrorism threats is not accurate. NATO has indeed been involved in counter-terrorism efforts, but it has not created a new division specifically focused on terrorism threats. NATO's primary mission remains collective defense against external threats, and its counter-terrorism efforts are part of its broader mission. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of NATO's activities.

Answer: 0"
1117,"Explanation: The claim that ""over 90 percent of Travis County's eligible residents have registered to vote"" is not accurate. According to the latest data from the Travis County Clerk's Office, as of the 2020 election, the voter registration rate in Travis County was around 70%. This figure is significantly lower than the 90% claimed in the statement.

Answer: 0"
1118,"Explanation: The claim that 68 percent of kids born in the African-American community today are born out of wedlock is not accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the percentage of births to unmarried mothers in the African-American community has been fluctuating but is not consistently at 68%. The most recent data from the CDC shows that the percentage of births to unmarried mothers in the African-American community is around 70%, but this figure is not static and varies over time. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"

While there is broad support for background checks, the exact percentage varies depending on the specific poll and the wording of the question. According to a 2021 Gallup poll, 63% of Americans support background checks for all gun purchases, which is a significant majority but not more than 80%.

Answer: 0"
1121,"Explanation: The claim about changing the rules for filibusters on presidential nominees is true.

This change was made to streamline the confirmation process for presidential nominees.

Answer: 1"
1122,"Explanation: The claim that more children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry is not accurate. While agricultural work can be dangerous and children are often involved in these activities, especially in developing countries, the number of child deaths in agriculture is not higher than in other industries. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), child labor in agriculture is prevalent, but the number of child deaths in agriculture is not disproportionately higher compared to other sectors. The claim is misleading and not supported by reliable data.

Answer: 0"
1123,"Explanation: The claim that rabid animals from other states carry different strains of rabies that Florida vaccines and serums don't affect is false. Rabies is caused by a virus that affects the nervous system and is transmitted through the bite of an infected animal. The virus does not mutate into different strains that are resistant to vaccines and serums. The rabies vaccine and serums used in Florida are effective against the rabies virus regardless of the state of origin of the infected animal. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirm that the rabies vaccine is effective against all strains of the virus.

Answer: 0"
1124,"Explanation: The claim is false. The cost of the bridge in Alaska to the island with 50 people is actually $223 million, not $223-million. The hyphen is not necessary and is likely a typo. The correct figure is $223 million.

Answer: 0"
1126,"Explanation: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is the largest tax increase in the history of the United States is not accurate. While the ACA did introduce several new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes are not the largest in U.S. history. For example, the Revenue Act of 1913, which established the modern income tax system, and the Revenue Act of 1940, which introduced the payroll tax, were larger tax increases. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
1127,"Explanation: The claim that a study ranked Florida No. 1 in government corruption under Gov. Rick Scott is false. There is no widely recognized study that ranks Florida as the most corrupt state under Rick Scott's governorship.

Answer: 0"
1128,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, Nevada is not expected to achieve energy independence in the immediate future. While Nevada has significant renewable energy resources, such as solar and geothermal, it still relies on imports for a significant portion of its energy needs. The state's energy independence would require substantial investment in infrastructure and technology to fully transition to renewable energy sources and reduce its dependence on external energy supplies.

Answer: 0"
1129,"Explanation: The claim is about the number of inflammatory sentences in a person's newsletters. Without specific context or evidence, it's difficult to verify the exact number of inflammatory sentences.

Answer: 1/0 (1 if this claim is true or 0 if this claim is false)"
1130,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain offered a bill ten years ago to ban a candidate from paying registered lobbyists is false. John McCain did not propose such a bill.

Answer: 1"
1132,"Explanation: The claim that tenure still exists but has been overhauled for teachers in New Jersey is true. In 2016, New Jersey passed a law that modified the tenure system for teachers. The law, known as the ""Teacher Tenure Reform Act,"" made it easier to remove teachers from their positions for poor performance. However, it did not eliminate tenure entirely. Instead, it introduced a new system that allows for more flexibility in evaluating and removing teachers who are not performing well.

Answer: 1"
1133,"Explanation: The claim about the coal industry is too vague to be evaluated as true or false. It does not specify a particular statement or claim about the coal industry that can be verified. Therefore, without additional context or specific information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
1134,"Explanation: The claim that Florida ranks 45th in the nation for tuition is false. According to the College Board's 2021-2022 data, Florida ranks 30th in the nation for in-state tuition and fees for public four-year colleges and universities. This information is available on the College Board's website and is widely reported in educational news outlets.

Answer: 0"
1135,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the topic of debt is frequently discussed in town meetings but never mentioned in debates. This claim is subjective and depends on the specific context and frequency of discussions in town meetings and debates. Without concrete evidence or specific examples, it's difficult to verify the claim's accuracy. Therefore, it's not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
1136,"Explanation: The claim that an annual income of $500,000 in Manhattan is considered middle class is false. In Manhattan, the median household income is around $100,000, and the average household income is around $150,000. Therefore, an income of $500,000 would be considered high income or upper class, not middle class.

Answer: 0"
1137,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific political achievement during a speaker's tenure. To verify this, I would need to check the official records of the speaker's term and the government's financial reports. However, without specific details or access to these records, I cannot definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
1138,"Explanation: The claim that then-Sen. Barack Obama refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership is false. In reality, Sen. Obama voted to raise the debt ceiling multiple times during his time in the Senate, including in 2004 and 2005. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation of Sen. Obama's stance on the debt ceiling and his criticism of President Bush's economic policies.

Answer: 0"
1139,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) did not find that the stimulus bill would lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2019. The CBO's analysis of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus bill) estimated that the legislation would increase GDP by 1.4 percent in 2009 and 2.6 percent in 2010, not reduce it.

Answer: 0"
1140,"Explanation: The claim is false. In Florida, while it is true that voters who have previously requested an absentee ballot can request a new one for future elections, they do not automatically receive a ballot without requesting it.

Answer: 0"
1141,"Explanation: The claim about the re-incarceration rate of adults released from state prisons in Rhode Island is based on a study conducted by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The study found that 28 percent of adults released from state prisons in Rhode Island were re-incarcerated within a year. This information is accurate and has been verified by multiple sources.

Answer: 1"
1142,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support the idea that President George W. Bush requested an increase in troops for more than eight months, including for the vice president's office. Additionally, the claim that President Obama filled a resource request in March is not accurate as it does not specify the context or the nature of the request.

Answer: 0"
1143,"Explanation: The claim that Democratic U.S. House candidate Julie Lassa pushed for a Canadian-style government takeover of health care is false. Julie Lassa has not advocated for a Canadian-style single-payer healthcare system.

1145,"Explanation: The claim is true. Hunters and hunting organizations often contribute financially to wildlife management and conservation efforts. These funds are used to protect habitats, manage wildlife populations, and combat poaching. Without these financial resources, many conservation projects would struggle to maintain their infrastructure and effectiveness.

Answer: 1"
1146,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Hosni Mubarak were all authoritarian leaders who suppressed independent unions, the claim that they ""didn't want unions"" is an oversimplification. Hitler, for instance, initially supported the German Labor Front (DAF) as a means to control the German workforce, but later suppressed it. Stalin also initially supported unions but later suppressed them as part of his broader campaign to control all aspects of society. Mubarak, similarly, initially allowed some unions but later suppressed them as part of his authoritarian rule. Therefore, the claim that they ""didn't want unions"" is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
1147,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not establish a new board of federal bureaucrats to dictate health plans. The ACA does create a Health Insurance Marketplace and provides subsidies for individuals to purchase health insurance, but it does not give a federal board the authority to dictate specific health plans for all individuals. The claim is a misrepresentation of the ACA's provisions.

Answer: 0"
1148,"Explanation: The claim that the problem with invasive species in the Great Lakes is not ballast water is false. Ballast water is indeed a significant source of invasive species in the Great Lakes. Invasive species, such as zebra and quagga mussels, have been introduced through ballast water from ships, leading to significant ecological and economic impacts. Therefore, the claim that ballast water is not a problem is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
1149,"Explanation: Dan Branch is a former Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas. He has not been known to have lobbied for the AFL-CIO, which is a federation of labor unions in the United States. The AFL-CIO is typically associated with Democratic Party politics, and Branch is a Republican. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would have lobbied for the AFL-CIO.

Answer: 0"
1150,"Explanation: The claim is false. Kansas has elected Democrats to the U.S. Senate in recent history. For example, Pat Roberts, a Republican, was elected in 1996 and served until 2015. However, the claim suggests that no Democrat has been elected since before ""The Wizard of Oz"" hit the movie theaters in 1939, which is not accurate. The last Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from Kansas was Jerry Moran, who was elected in 2010.

Answer: 0"
1151,"Explanation: The claim is false. Justice Sonia Sotomayor did not throw out the New Haven firefighters' lawsuit in an unsigned opinion. The case, Ricci v. DeStefano, was decided by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote, with Sotomayor dissenting. The majority opinion was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Sotomayor's dissent was signed and publicly available. The claim that the opinion was unsigned and that it was a ""sneaky"" move is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
1152,"Explanation: The claim states that for the first time in 35 years, more businesses are dying than starting. This claim is based on a specific time frame and a specific comparison between business deaths and births. To verify this claim, one would need to look at data from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Small Business Administration, or other reputable economic research institutions. Without specific data to support this claim, it is difficult to determine its veracity.

Answer: 0"
1153,"Explanation: Systems development charges (SDCs) are fees levied by local governments to fund the costs of new infrastructure and services required to support new development. While it is true that SDCs are primarily intended for capital investments, such as roads, water and sewer lines, and other public infrastructure, the specific use of these funds can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the local government's policies. Some jurisdictions may allow for a portion of SDCs to be used for operational expenses or other purposes, but this is typically subject to specific regulations and oversight.

Answer: 0"
1154,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney and Bain Capital are to blame for a woman's premature death due to the closure of the plant where her husband worked is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that Bain Capital, under Romney's leadership, closed several plants, including the one where the woman's husband worked, it is not accurate to attribute the woman's death directly to this closure. The claim lacks specific evidence linking the plant closure to the woman's death and does not consider other potential contributing factors to her health condition. Therefore, the claim is not supported by sufficient evidence.

Answer: 0"
1155,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Texas Railroad Commission is a regulatory agency that oversees the oil and gas industry in Texas. In 2021, the commission's chair, Christi Craddick, resigned from her position. This information is publicly available and verified by multiple credible sources.

Answer: 1"
1156,"Explanation: The 2013 immigration bill, also known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did not specifically address Syrian refugees or their resettlement. The bill focused on border security, legalization of undocumented immigrants, and other immigration-related issues. The resettlement of Syrian refugees was a separate issue that began to gain attention after the Syrian civil war escalated in 2011. The U.S. government's ability to bring Syrian refugees to the country was governed by the Refugee Act of 1980, which established the process for admitting refugees, including background checks. Therefore, the claim that the 2013 immigration bill expanded President Obama's ability to bring Syrian refugees without mandating meaningful background checks is false.

Answer: 0"
1157,"Explanation: The claim that Suzanne Bonamici was the only no vote on a 2009 bill cracking down on drunk drivers is false.

Answer: 0"
1158,"Explanation: The claim is false. The $2 billion spent on alternative energy as part of the stimulus package did not exclusively go to purchase wind turbines built in China. The claim misrepresents the allocation of funds and the source of the wind turbines. The stimulus package was designed to promote domestic renewable energy projects, and while some components may have been sourced from abroad, the majority of the funds were intended to support American jobs and industries.

Answer: 0"
1159,"Explanation: The claim that federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts is not accurate. While federal employees often have higher salaries than private sector employees, the difference is not typically twice as much.

Answer: 0"
1160,"Explanation: As of the latest data available, Latinos do not make up the majority population in Texas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2020, the largest ethnic group in Texas is White (42.4%), followed by Hispanic or Latino (39.8%), and then Black or African American (12.8%). Therefore, the claim that Latinos now make up the majority population in Texas is false.

Answer: 0"
1161,"Explanation: The claim is false. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker did propose a law that would provide a two-year tax exemption for businesses that move into the state, but this law was not passed. The proposed law was part of a broader economic development package, but it did not become law. Therefore, businesses moving into Wisconsin would not be exempt from paying taxes on their income for two years.

Answer: 0"
1162,"Explanation: The claim that ""(I) helped to invent a system that saved over a billion dollars on welfare"" is not verifiable with the information provided.

Answer: 0"
1163,"Explanation: The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is a complex set of laws and regulations that govern the tax system in the United States. It is estimated to be around 70,000 pages long. The Bible, on the other hand, is a religious text that is approximately 780,000 words long. Therefore, the claim that there are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible is false.

Answer: 0"
1164,"Explanation: The claim that ""Most voters prefer zombies to the current U.S. Congress"" is not based on any credible polling data or scientific research. It is a hyperbolic and humorous statement that does not reflect the actual preferences of voters. The statement is likely intended to be a joke or a commentary on the public's dissatisfaction with the current political climate, rather than a factual claim.

Answer: 0"
1165,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the wealthiest counties in the United States are not concentrated in and around the Washington, D.C. area. The top 10 wealthiest counties by median income are spread across various states, including California, New York, and Texas. For example, the wealthiest county in the U.S. is Loudoun County, Virginia, which is near Washington, D.C., but the other top counties are not in the same area.

Answer: 0"
1166,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not promise to cut the deficit by half by the end of his first term. Instead, he promised to reduce the deficit by half over the next decade. The actual reduction in the deficit during his presidency was significant, but it did not meet the specific goal of cutting it by half by the end of his first term.

Answer: 0"
1167,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama carried Congressional District 13 by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012 is false. The 2008 election results for Congressional District 13 show that Obama won by a margin of 10.5 points, not 8.2. In 2012, he won by a margin of 11.3 points, not 5.6. These figures can be verified through official election results from the Federal Election Commission or other reputable sources.

Answer: 0"
1168,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""We are not producing jobs"" contradicts the claim that ""We created 80,000 jobs last month."" If the government or company in question created 80,000 jobs, then they are indeed producing jobs. The claim also implies that the net job creation is negative, which is not supported by the statement that 80,000 jobs were created.

Answer: 0"
1169,"Explanation: The claim that ""we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend"" is a misinterpretation of the national debt. The national debt refers to the total amount of money that the U.S. government owes to its creditors. When the government spends more money than it collects in taxes, it borrows money to cover the difference. However, this does not mean that every dollar spent is borrowed. The claim is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
1170,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the promise Delta Air Lines made to the person or the people of Memphis. Without concrete information, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, it cannot be determined if Delta Air Lines has indeed broken a promise.

Answer: 0"
1171,"Explanation: The claim is false. The wealthiest counties in the United States are typically measured by median household income, not by the number of counties in a specific area. The Washington, D.C., area is indeed home to some of the wealthiest counties in the country, but it is not accurate to say that seven of the top ten wealthiest counties are in this area. The top ten wealthiest counties in the U.S. are often found in states like California, New York, and Texas, and the specific counties can vary depending on the source and the year of the data.

Answer: 0"
1172,"Explanation: Refugees undergo a more rigorous screening process than the average tourist in the U.S. This is due to the fact that refugees are subject to a more extensive vetting process, including interviews, background checks, and security screenings, to ensure they do not pose a threat to national security. In contrast, tourists typically only need to provide basic information and may not undergo the same level of scrutiny.

Answer: 1"
1173,"Explanation: While water transportation is indeed one of the most fuel-efficient and least polluting means of moving cargo, it is not necessarily the safest or least expensive. Safety can vary depending on the type of waterway and the specific conditions of the voyage. Additionally, water transportation can be expensive due to factors such as port fees, vessel maintenance, and the need for specialized equipment. Therefore, the claim that water transportation is the ""safest"" and ""least expensive"" is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
1174,"Explanation: The claim that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is false. According to the Oregon Secretary of State's website, the voter turnout for the 2008 general election in Oregon was approximately 75.5%. Therefore, the claim that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
1175,"Explanation: The claim states that ""about 7 in 10 of Oregon's inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses."" To verify this, I would need to check the latest statistics from a reliable source such as the Oregon Department of Corrections or the Bureau of Justice Statistics. However, based on general trends and available data, it is known that a significant portion of inmates in the United States are incarcerated for violent crimes and serious sex offenses. Without specific data for Oregon, it is difficult to confirm the exact percentage, but it is plausible that a substantial number of inmates in Oregon fall into these categories.

Answer: 1"
1176,"Explanation: The claim is false. Harry Reid, who served as the Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2015, was known to have a contentious relationship with John McCain, but he did not publicly express his dislike for McCain in the way described in the claim. The quote attributed to Reid is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
1177,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has plans to push legislation that would allow the state to declare financial martial law and take over municipal governments is false. There is no evidence or credible source supporting this claim. Walker's administration has not proposed or implemented any such legislation. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or fabrication of his policies.

Answer: 0"
1178,"Explanation: The claim that the Fair Tax will be like waving a magic wand releasing us from pain and unfairness is hyperbolic and misleading. The Fair Tax, also known as the FairTax Act, is a proposed tax reform that would replace the current income tax system with a national sales tax. While proponents argue that it could simplify the tax code and reduce the tax burden on lower-income individuals, it also has significant drawbacks, such as potentially increasing the tax burden on lower-income individuals due to the regressive nature of a sales tax, and it does not address all forms of economic inequality or unfairness. Therefore, the claim that it will release us from all pain and unfairness is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
1179,"Explanation: The claim states that Governor Carcieri has not been campaigning with the speaker. Without specific context or evidence, it is difficult to verify the truth of this claim. However, if the speaker is a political figure and the claim is made in a public or official setting, it could be considered true if there is no evidence to the contrary.

Answer: 1"
1180,"Explanation: The claim states that U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago. This claim is false because it is not typical for a legislator to oppose a vote on their own legislation. If a legislator introduces a bill, they typically support it and advocate for its passage. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the legislative process.

Answer: 0"
1181,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Crist sent his 'top policy staffer to the House Committee to testify in support of the proposal,' then vetoed the bill"" implies that Crist initially supported the proposal but later changed his mind. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Crist's top policy staffer testified in support of the proposal, nor is there any indication that he later vetoed the bill. Therefore, the claim is not supported by facts.

Answer: 0"
1182,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, the average annual expenditure on health care for a family was approximately $4,000. This figure is significantly lower than the $13,000 claimed in the statement.

Answer: 0"
1183,"Explanation: The claim ""I supported the surge when you didn't"" is vague and lacks specific context. It could refer to a political, military, or social event, but without additional information, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

1185,"Explanation: The claim that ""Forty-three million Americans are on food stamps"" is false. According to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as of 2021, approximately 41.5 million Americans were receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which is the program commonly referred to as food stamps. The claim is exaggerated by 1.5 million.

Answer: 0"
1186,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual, Buono, and their voting record on tax-related issues. To verify this claim, I would need to check the voting records of the individual in question. However, without specific details or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
1187,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific time period and percentage increases/decreases in the number of EPA employees and total federal personnel. To verify this claim, one would need to check the historical data for the EPA and total federal personnel from 1972 to 2011. However, without access to this specific data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
1188,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Senate Finance Committee bill, which is a legislative document, does not have a ""report"" by the health insurance industry. The bill is a legislative proposal, and any analysis or critique of it would come from various sources, including news outlets, think tanks, or advocacy groups, but not from the health insurance industry itself.

Answer: 0"
1189,"Explanation: Wayne Powell, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, has indeed stated that he has no objection to removing the phrase ""In God We Trust"" from U.S. currency. This statement was made during his time in office and has been reported in various news outlets.

Answer: 1"
1190,"Explanation: In the United States, the practice of checking the immigration status of individuals during routine traffic stops or other arrests is a contentious issue. While some states have laws that allow police officers to check immigration status, others have laws that prohibit such checks. The specific rights of police officers in this regard can vary significantly depending on the state and the context of the arrest. Therefore, the claim that ""Police officers in this state have that right, to check the immigration status of people they arrest"" is not universally true and depends on the specific state and its laws.

Answer: 0"
1191,"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold voted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants is false. Russ Feingold, a former U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has never voted to provide Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or a deliberate falsehood.

Answer: 0"
1192,"Explanation: The claim that 25% of kids in foster care are there because their parents are involved in drugs is not accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the most common reasons for children entering foster care are neglect (50.9%), parental substance abuse (28.5%), and physical abuse (10.7%). The claim overstates the percentage of children in foster care due to parental drug involvement.

Answer: 0"
1193,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible source or data to support the statement that over 81 percent of babies born at LBJ Hospital in Houston are born to women who are not here legally. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of data regarding the immigration status of patients at the hospital.

Answer: 0"
1194,"Explanation: The claim is false. Donna Shalala, who served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton, did not leave anyone with 12 million doses of smallpox vaccine. Additionally, the claim that the person created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man, woman, and child in America is not supported by any credible sources. The U.S. government has been working on smallpox vaccine distribution and production, but there is no evidence to support the claim that an individual created enough vaccine to vaccinate the entire population.

Answer: 0"
1195,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama shut down NASA space flights and turned the agency into a Muslim outreach department is false. During his presidency, NASA continued its space missions, including the International Space Station and the Mars rovers. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the claim that NASA was turned into a Muslim outreach department. This claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
1196,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the compromise tax agreement. The agreement does not mean that 99.7% of American families will not pay any estate tax. Instead, it means that the estate tax exemption is increased, so only the wealthiest estates will be subject to the tax. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
1197,"Explanation: The claim that millennials are more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans is not accurate. According to various polls and surveys, millennials tend to be more liberal on social issues, including abortion. A 2019 Gallup poll found that 58% of millennials (born 1981-1996) support legal abortion, compared to 51% of baby boomers (born 1946-1964) and 53% of Generation X (born 1965-1980). Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
1198,"Explanation: David Cicilline, a former U.S. Representative from Rhode Island, has indeed been a strong advocate for tougher laws against child abusers, domestic abusers, and abusers of the elderly. He has sponsored and supported various bills and legislation aimed at protecting vulnerable populations. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
1199,"Explanation: The claim is false. The survival rates for prostate cancer are not significantly different between the United States and England. The 5-year relative survival rate for prostate cancer in the United States is approximately 98%, while in England, it is around 91%. These rates are not significantly different, and the claim that the survival rate in England is only 44% is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
1200,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or policy from former President Barack Obama that specifically targets individuals who have investments for their child's education, own mutual funds, or have stocks in a retirement plan. Tax policies are typically broader and do not target specific investment types or individuals based on their personal financial circumstances.

Answer: 0"
1201,"Explanation: The claim is generally true. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls were relatively flat from 2007 to 2021, with some fluctuations but no significant upward trend. On the other hand, corporate profits have been increasing, and CEO pay has also been rising. This discrepancy is often highlighted in discussions about income inequality.

Answer: 1"
1202,"Explanation: The claim that personal income is growing faster in Tennessee on average than any other state in the country is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal income growth rates vary by state, and Tennessee's growth rate is not consistently the highest among all states. While Tennessee may have experienced significant growth in certain periods, it is not accurate to say that it is growing faster than every other state on average.

Answer: 0"
1203,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama played nearly 100 rounds of golf as president is false. While it is true that Obama enjoyed golf, the number of rounds he played is often exaggerated. According to various sources, Obama played around 300 rounds of golf during his presidency, not nearly 100.

Answer: 0"
1204,"Explanation: The claim that the Army is spending $7 million to sponsor a NASCAR team is false. The U.S. Army has not been involved in any sponsorship of a NASCAR team, and there is no official record or announcement from the Army or NASCAR confirming such a sponsorship. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication.

Answer: 0"
1205,"Explanation: The claim that Obama voted to support President Bush between 40 and 50 percent of the time over the past two years is false. Barack Obama served as the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017, and George W. Bush was the President from 2001 to 2009. Therefore, there was no overlap in their presidencies, and Obama did not vote to support Bush during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
1206,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Democratic proposal for a government-controlled health care plan, often referred to as Medicare for All, does not aim to deprive Americans of their current health care coverage. Instead, it seeks to expand access to health care by providing a public option that would compete with private insurance plans. The proposal does not target or aim to eliminate existing private health insurance plans. The claim of depriving 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage is a misrepresentation of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
1207,"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is responsible for the roughly $7,800 in property taxes per year is false. Property taxes are levied by local governments, including cities, counties, and school districts, to fund public services. The mayor of a city has some influence over the budget and tax rates, but they are not directly responsible for the amount of property taxes an individual pays. The tax rate and the amount of property taxes paid are determined by the city council and other local governing bodies, not the mayor.

Answer: 0"
1208,"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is not identified as Houston's mayor. Without specific information about who made the claim and their role in Houston's job growth, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
1209,"Explanation: The claim that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters knew that they were planning to take over the country and attack it is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. The FBI investigation into the San Bernardino shooting did not find any evidence that the shooters had plans to take over the country or attack it. The neighbors of the shooters did not report any such plans to the authorities.

Answer: 0"
1210,"Explanation: According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the leading cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin is suicide, followed by unintentional injuries (which include drug overdoses). While opioid-related deaths are a significant public health issue, they are not the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin.

Answer: 0"
1211,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Texas Supreme Court's website, the majority of justices have prior judicial experience. As of 2021, out of the 150 justices who have served on the Texas Supreme Court, only a small fraction had no prior judicial experience. The claim exaggerates the number of justices with no prior experience.

Answer: 0"
1212,"Explanation: The claim that the incidents of threats against President Barack Obama are greater than for any other president in modern times is not accurate. While President Obama did face several threats and assassination attempts during his presidency, the number of threats he faced is not unprecedented compared to other modern presidents. For instance, President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt, and President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Therefore, the claim that Obama faced more threats than any other modern president is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
1213,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific proposal by President Obama in 2011, which was a spending freeze for non-defense discretionary spending. This freeze was intended to reduce the growth of the federal budget, but it did not affect the overall spending levels for the period from 2011 to 2020. The claim that the spending freeze would only reduce the $42 trillion in government spending by little more than one-half of 1 percent is accurate because the spending freeze was a temporary measure that did not significantly impact the overall spending trend over the decade.

Answer: 1"
1214,"Explanation: The claim that there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day is highly unlikely. The process of creating and implementing new laws typically involves a lengthy process that includes legislative proposals, committee reviews, debates, and approvals. It is not feasible for 40,000 new laws to be enacted in a single day. This claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinformation.

Answer: 0"
1215,"Explanation: At the beginning of World War II, the United Kingdom had a significantly larger army than Portugal. The UK had a standing army of around 200,000 troops, while Portugal had a much smaller army, with estimates ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 troops. Therefore, the claim that the UK had a relatively small army, smaller than Portugal's, is false.

Answer: 0"
1216,"Explanation: The claim states that ""Were within 600 miles of 60 percent of America."" This is a geographical claim that can be evaluated by looking at the population distribution and the distances involved. The United States has a population of approximately 331 million people. If we consider 60 percent of the population, that would be around 200 million people. If we assume a uniform distribution, 600 miles would cover a significant portion of the country, but it's not accurate to say that 60 percent of the population is within 600 miles of a specific location. The claim is vague and does not provide specific data or context to support the claim.

Answer: 0"
1217,"Explanation: The claim about state budget cuts resulting in nearly 4,000 educator layoffs is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess the truth of this claim, I would need specific data or sources that confirm the number of educator layoffs and the direct correlation to state budget cuts. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified.

Answer: 0"
1218,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific gun bill before the Senate that is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners. The most recent significant gun legislation, such as the Bipartisan Gun Violence Prevention Act of 2023, has focused on measures like background checks, red flag laws, and other provisions aimed at reducing gun violence, but not universal registration of firearms.

Answer: 0"
1219,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the U.S. added 431,000 jobs in February 2021, making it the top job creator for that month. However, the claim that the U.S. is now the No. 4 job creator in the last year is incorrect. The U.S. has been the top job creator in the last year, with a total of 10.6 million jobs added from March 2020 to February 2021.

Answer: 0"
1220,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has recovered more than $60 million that was lost to Medicaid fraud is true. According to a report from the Georgia Department of Community Health, the state has recovered over $60 million in Medicaid fraud since 2010. This includes funds recovered through investigations, audits, and prosecutions.

Answer: 1"
1221,"Explanation: The claim ""This is a test of the fact-checking widget"" is a statement about the purpose of the current interaction, which is to test the functionality of a fact-checking widget. Since the purpose of the statement is to inform about the test, it is not a claim about a factual event or statement that can be verified as true or false. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a true or false claim.

Answer: 0"
1222,"Explanation: The claim that the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets and resulted in a decrease in murder and violent crime rates for eight consecutive years is misleading. The bill in question is the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, not Joe Biden. The act did not add 100,000 cops but rather provided funding for local law enforcement agencies. Additionally, while there was a decrease in violent crime rates in the 1990s, it is not accurate to attribute this solely to the Biden Crime Bill. Multiple factors, including changes in policing strategies, demographic shifts, and economic conditions, contributed to the decline in crime rates.

Answer: 0"
1223,"Explanation: The claim is false. While Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA) did make some changes to Medicare, it did not cut Medicare benefits for seniors. The ACA actually expanded Medicare benefits for seniors by providing preventive care services without cost-sharing and closing the Medicare Part D ""doughnut hole."" The claim that only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors is incorrect because other presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, have made changes to Medicare that could be seen as cuts or reductions in benefits.

Answer: 0"
1224,"Explanation: The claim that having a baby is a leading cause of poverty in the United States is not accurate. While it is true that having children can increase the financial burden on a family, it is not the leading cause of poverty. Poverty in the United States is primarily driven by factors such as lack of education, unemployment, underemployment, and systemic issues like racial and gender-based wage gaps, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate social safety nets. Having a baby can exacerbate existing financial struggles, but it is not the primary cause of poverty.

Answer: 0"
1225,"Explanation: The claim that you have to get a license to fish on our beaches is generally false. In many places, including the United States, you do not need a license to fish from the shore. However, there are some exceptions and regulations that may apply, such as size limits, daily bag limits, and specific gear restrictions. It's always a good idea to check local regulations or contact a local fishing authority for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Answer: 0"
1226,"Explanation: The claim is true. Minnesota has had Republicans in control of at least one part of the government for most of the time since 2007, with the exception of 2007-2008 and 2011-2012. Wisconsin, on the other hand, had Democrats controlling both legislative chambers and the governorship from 2011 to 2017.

Answer: 1"
1227,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island voters are moving away from the Democratic party to non-affiliation is based on a trend observed in recent elections. According to the latest data from the Rhode Island Secretary of State's office, there has been a significant increase in the number of unaffiliated voters in the state. This trend suggests that a portion of voters who previously identified as Democrats are now choosing to register as unaffiliated. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that all Democrats are leaving the party; rather, it indicates a shift in voter registration patterns.

Answer: 1"
1228,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of elections and the number of incumbents defeated can vary greatly depending on the specific states and years in question. The claim does not provide specific details about the states or years involved, making it impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim that only three incumbents have been defeated in 420 elections is highly unlikely and suggests a lack of understanding of the typical outcomes of state legislative elections.

Answer: 0"
1229,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama doubled the deficit is misleading. While it is true that the U.S. federal deficit increased significantly during Obama's presidency, it is not accurate to say that he doubled it. The deficit increased from $1.08 trillion in 2008 to $1.4 trillion in 2012, which is an increase of about 30%, not a doubling. Additionally, the deficit was largely driven by the economic crisis and the subsequent stimulus packages, not solely by Obama's policies.

Answer: 0"
1230,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan is false. John McCain, a Republican, was a strong advocate for a surge of troops in Afghanistan during his time as a senator and was critical of President Obama's withdrawal strategy. There is no evidence to suggest that McCain has changed his position on this issue.

Answer: 0"
1231,"Explanation: The claim that most serial killers and people who commit domestic violence start off by abusing animals is not supported by empirical evidence. While there are some cases where individuals who abuse animals also go on to commit other forms of violence, this is not a universal pattern. The correlation between animal abuse and other forms of violence is not strong enough to make the claim that ""most"" of these individuals start off by abusing animals.

Answer: 0"
1232,"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland supported giving $150 billion to the Iranian regime is false. Ted Strickland, a former governor of Ohio, has not been involved in any policy decisions regarding the Iranian regime or any financial support for it. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his political stance.

Answer: 0"
1233,"Explanation: The claim is false. The DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) is a proposed law that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The claim that the DREAM Act would grant lower tuition to undocumented immigrants is a misinterpretation of the act. The DREAM Act does not specifically address tuition rates, and it does not provide lower tuition rates to undocumented immigrants. The claim is a distortion of the facts surrounding the DREAM Act.

Answer: 0"
1234,"Explanation: The claim about possibly raising the Social Security retirement age is true. The Social Security Administration has been discussing and considering changes to the retirement age due to the increasing life expectancy and the need to ensure the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. This is a topic of ongoing debate and discussion in the United States.

Answer: 1"
1235,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican-authored state budget in question does not include a provision forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance. The claim is a misinterpretation of the budget's provisions, which primarily focus on expanding access to health insurance through the marketplace and potentially increasing the number of people eligible for subsidies.

Answer: 0"
1236,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the bipartisan task force or its existence. Without concrete information or a reliable source, it is impossible to verify the claim's authenticity.

Answer: 0"
1237,"Explanation: The claim is false. While there has been significant construction of new oil and gas pipelines in recent years, the claim that the total length of these pipelines is enough to circle the Earth and then some is an exaggeration. The Earth's circumference is approximately 40,075 kilometers (24,901 miles). The total length of new pipelines constructed in the past three years is not enough to exceed this distance.

Answer: 0"
1238,"Explanation: The claim is about the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and its benchmarks. The GAO is a federal agency that provides independent, objective analysis to Congress and the public. The claim states that three out of 18 benchmarks have been fulfilled, which implies a failure. However, the claim does not provide specific details about which benchmarks were fulfilled or what the criteria for success are. Without specific details, it is difficult to verify the claim's accuracy. Additionally, the claim mentions ""Republican math,"" which suggests a political bias, but this does not affect the factuality of the claim.

Answer: 0"
1239,"Explanation: The claim is true. President Barack Obama did indeed make statements about ISIS (or ISIL) being contained, specifically in the context of its geographic expansion in Iraq and Syria. For instance, in a 2015 press conference, he stated, ""We have contained ISIL's expansion in Iraq and Syria."" This statement was made in response to the situation on the ground at that time, indicating that the containment was a specific response to the geographic spread of ISIS in those regions.

Answer: 1"
1240,"Explanation: The claim states that ""earmarks have come down significantly, 75 percent."" However, without specific context or data to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Earmarks are typically government funds allocated for specific projects or programs, and their reduction could be due to various reasons such as budget cuts, policy changes, or shifts in government priorities. To accurately evaluate this claim, one would need to refer to official government reports, budget documents, or other reliable sources that provide specific data on the reduction of earmarks.

Answer: 0"
1241,"Explanation: The claim that 2010 was the worst year ever for America's doctors reimbursed by Medicare is not accurate. While 2010 did see a significant reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates, it was not the worst year ever. In fact, the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, which was used to determine reimbursement rates, led to a 21.4% reduction in 2010. However, this was not the largest reduction in history. The largest reduction occurred in 2003, when the SGR formula led to a 4.4% reduction. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
1242,"Explanation: The claim that ""regulations have quadrupled"" under a specific president is not accurate. According to the Mercatus Center's study, the number of new regulations issued by the federal government has not quadrupled. The study found that the number of new regulations issued by the federal government has increased by about 10% under this president, which is not a quadrupling.

Answer: 0"
1243,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are advisers within Obama's campaign who are anti-Israel. While it is true that some individuals associated with Obama's campaign have expressed views critical of Israeli policies, it is not accurate to label them as ""anti-Israel"" in a blanket statement. The claim is an oversimplification and lacks nuance. It is important to note that political views are complex and cannot be reduced to a single label.

Answer: 0"
1244,"Explanation: The claim is true. During the Great Recession of 2008, corporate profits indeed declined significantly. However, by 2010, two years after the recession, corporate profits began to recover and eventually surpassed pre-recession levels. This recovery was driven by various factors, including increased productivity, cost-cutting measures, and a recovering economy.

Answer: 1"
1245,"Explanation: The claim is false. The president did not propose eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers. In fact, the proposed tax reform in 2017, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, did not eliminate charitable deductions but rather increased the standard deduction, which could reduce the number of people who itemize their deductions, including charitable donations.

Answer: 0"
1246,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has been the subject of numerous claims about his financial dealings, including allegations of having millions in the Cayman Islands. However, these claims have been widely debunked. Romney has publicly disclosed his tax returns, which show that he has not hidden millions in offshore accounts. The claim that he had millions in the Cayman Islands is a misrepresentation of his financial situation.

Answer: 0"
1247,"Explanation: The claim ""There is already a mosque four blocks away"" cannot be verified without specific context or additional information. The truthfulness of this claim depends on the location and the definition of ""four blocks"" in the context of the statement. It could be true or false depending on the exact location and the distance measurement used.

Answer: 0/1"
1248,"Explanation: The claim ""He reformed welfare before others tried"" is vague and lacks specific context. It does not provide enough information to determine who ""he"" is, what ""welfare"" refers to, or what ""others"" are. Without this context, it is impossible to verify the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0"
1249,"Explanation: The claim that 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay is not accurate. While eBay is a significant platform for many people to sell items and make money, the number of people who make their primary living off eBay is much lower. According to various studies and reports, the number of people who rely on eBay for their primary income is in the tens of thousands, not millions.

Answer: 0"
1250,"Explanation: The claim that Northern Virginia is the most heavily trafficked place in the country is not accurate. While Northern Virginia, particularly the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, does experience heavy traffic due to its proximity to the nation's capital and major highways, it is not the most heavily trafficked place in the country. That distinction typically goes to areas with high population densities and major transportation hubs, such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
1251,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan's proposal, known as the ""Ryan Budget,"" did not limit Medicare spending to $15,000 per person. Instead, it proposed converting Medicare into a premium support system, where beneficiaries would receive a fixed amount of money to purchase private health insurance plans. The $15,000 figure is a misinterpretation of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
1252,"Explanation: The claim about 25 million to 30 million people being allowed to access a national health insurance exchange is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been in effect since 2014 and has provided health insurance to millions of Americans through the Health Insurance Marketplace. However, the claim of a specific number of people being allowed to access the exchange is not accurate and does not reflect the reality of the ACA's implementation.

Answer: 0"
1253,"Explanation: The claim states that Oregon has had unemployment higher than the national average for 17 years. To verify this, I would need to check historical unemployment data for Oregon and the United States. However, without specific data points, it's challenging to confirm the claim. Typically, unemployment rates fluctuate over time, and it's possible for a state to have higher unemployment than the national average for extended periods. Therefore, without concrete data, it's difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
1254,"Explanation: John McCain has not proposed to keep the estate tax at 0 percent. In fact, he has previously supported the repeal of the estate tax, but his stance on this issue has evolved over time. As of my last update, there is no specific proposal from John McCain to keep the estate tax at 0 percent.

Answer: 0"
1255,"Explanation: The claim is false. Anthony Gemma, a former Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010, has consistently identified as pro-life. There is no evidence to suggest that he has changed his stance to pro-choice.

Answer: 0"
1256,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Scott has teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist is a complex one. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified evidence to support this specific claim. The claim is not substantiated by credible news sources or official records. Therefore, it is likely to be a false or unfounded claim.

Answer: 0"
1257,"Explanation: The claim that ""there is not one Democrat who endorses the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan"" is false. While it is true that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan, which proposed to replace Medicare with a voucher system, was not widely endorsed by Democrats, there were some Democrats who expressed support for certain aspects of the plan or were open to negotiations. For instance, some Democrats, such as Senator Joe Lieberman, were open to discussing a voucher system as part of a broader healthcare reform package. Therefore, the claim that ""there is not one Democrat who endorses the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan"" is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
1258,"Explanation: The claim that the United States death rate is two-and-a-half times higher for those who do not have a high school education is based on a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study found that individuals without a high school diploma had a mortality rate that was approximately 2.5 times higher than those with a high school diploma or higher. This indicates that the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
1259,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about a specific area (McAllen) and its constituents. To verify this claim, one would need to refer to reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Census Bureau, or local health department reports. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
1260,"Explanation: The claim that Switzerland and the Netherlands cover all their citizens using private insurers and do so for much less cost is misleading. Both countries have universal healthcare systems, but they differ in their approach to funding and delivery. In Switzerland, the healthcare system is primarily funded through a mix of public and private insurance, with the government setting minimum coverage requirements. The Netherlands also has a universal healthcare system, but it is funded through a combination of public and private insurance, with the government regulating the market to ensure affordability and accessibility. While these systems may have lower costs compared to some other countries, they are not entirely private insurers covering all citizens.

1261,"Explanation: The claim that ExxonMobil made $19 billion in profit last year and paid zero in taxes, receiving a $156 million refund from the IRS, is false. While it is true that ExxonMobil has reported significant profits, the claim about paying zero taxes and receiving a refund is misleading. Corporations can receive tax refunds if they overpay their taxes, but this does not mean they paid zero in taxes. The claim is likely an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the company's tax situation.

Answer: 0"
1262,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is acting without consultation or input from the company to stop the sale of Buckyballs. However, the CPSC typically follows a process that includes consultation with manufacturers and other stakeholders before taking regulatory actions. The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that the CPSC is acting without consultation. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

1264,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the United States has one of the highest vaccination rates among developed countries. However, some African countries have also achieved high vaccination rates, particularly in the context of COVID-19. For example, countries like Rwanda and Seychelles have had high vaccination rates due to their effective public health strategies and international support. Therefore, while it is true that some African countries have higher vaccination rates than others, it is not accurate to say that all African countries have higher rates than the United States.

Answer: 0"
1266,"Explanation: The claim that ""For decades, the states gas tax has been among the highest in the nation"" is not accurate. While some states do have high gas taxes, it is not accurate to say that this has been the case for decades. Gas tax rates vary by state and can change over time. For example, in 2021, California had the highest gas tax rate in the nation, but other states have had higher rates in the past. Therefore, the claim is not true.

1268,"Explanation: The claim that small businesses are going out of business in record numbers is not accurate. While it is true that many small businesses have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall trend is not as severe as the claim suggests. According to various reports and studies, while there has been an increase in business closures, the rate is not unprecedented and is not at record levels. The Small Business Administration (SBA) and other sources have reported that while many businesses have closed, the overall number of closures is not at an all-time high.

Answer: 0"
1271,"Explanation: The claim is false. The weight of turkeys has indeed increased over time due to selective breeding and improved feeding practices. However, the specific weights provided in the claim are not accurate. According to the National Turkey Federation, the average weight of a turkey in the United States in 2020 was around 16 pounds, which is significantly higher than the 13.2 pounds claimed for the 1930s. The 29.8 pounds claimed for today's turkeys is also not accurate, as the average weight of a turkey in 2020 was around 16 pounds.

1273,"Explanation: The claim is false. The $60 billion approved by Congress in response to Hurricane Sandy was not solely for disaster relief. The funds were allocated to various purposes, including infrastructure repair, housing assistance, and economic recovery. The 10 percent figure is misleading as it suggests that only 10 percent of the funds were used for disaster relief, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
1274,"Explanation: The claim is false. The President has indeed taken executive actions on immigration, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for certain countries. However, these actions have been challenged in court, and the President has not claimed that he did not have the constitutional power to take them. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the President's statements and actions.

Answer: 0"
1276,"Explanation: The claim is generally true. The U.S. tax system is progressive, meaning that higher-income individuals typically pay a higher effective tax rate than lower-income individuals. The top 1% of earners in the U.S. often pay an effective tax rate of around 20-30%, while the middle class, which typically falls into the 15% and 25% income tax brackets, also faces payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes) that can add up to around 7.65% of their income. Therefore, the claim that the mega-rich pay about 15 percent in taxes while the middle class is hit with heavy payroll taxes is accurate.

Answer: 1"
1277,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's estimate of a $3.6 billion state budget deficit is manufactured and a bogus figure is false. The Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, an independent state agency, has confirmed that the state faces a budget deficit of $3.6 billion for the 2021-2023 biennium. This figure is based on the state's revenue projections and spending plans, and it is not a manufactured or bogus figure.

Answer: 0"
1279,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are both regulatory agencies in the United States, but they have different jurisdictions. The USDA primarily regulates meat, poultry, and egg products, while the FDA regulates most other foods, including sandwiches. The number of slices of bread in a sandwich does not change the regulatory agency responsible for it. Both a sandwich on one slice of bread and a sandwich on two slices of bread would fall under the FDA's jurisdiction.

Answer: 0"
1280,"Explanation: The claim that ""Among Syrian refugees, there aren't that many women, there aren't that many children"" is false. According to various reports and studies, the Syrian refugee population is composed of a significant number of women and children.

1281,"Explanation: The Buffett Rule, proposed by Warren Buffett, is a tax policy that would impose a minimum tax rate on individuals with very high incomes. The claim that the Buffett Rule would bring in less than $5 billion per year is false. The Buffett Rule is designed to ensure that high-income individuals pay a minimum tax rate, and estimates suggest that it could generate significant revenue. For example, a 2012 analysis by the Congressional Research Service estimated that the Buffett Rule could generate around $50 billion in revenue annually. Therefore, the claim that it would bring in less than $5 billion per year is inaccurate.

1283,"Explanation: The claim that one-third of the healthcare dollar goes to insurance companies is a misinterpretation of the actual distribution of healthcare costs. The claim is often used to argue against the high cost of healthcare insurance, but it is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in 2019, about 34% of healthcare spending was for private health insurance, not one-third. The remaining 66% was for Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs, as well as out-of-pocket spending by patients. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
1288,"Explanation: The claim is false. The largest six financial institutions in the United States do not have assets that are equivalent to 60 percent of the GDP of the United States. According to the Federal Reserve, the total assets of the six largest U.S. banks (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) were approximately $12.5 trillion in 2021. The GDP of the United States in 2021 was around $22.9 trillion. Therefore, the assets of these six banks are approximately 55% of the GDP, not 60%.

Answer: 0"
1289,"Explanation: The claim suggests that bus riders are subsidizing the Leander-to-Austin train, implying that the train's costs are being covered by bus riders. However, this is not accurate. The Leander-to-Austin train is a separate service with its own funding sources, typically including fares, government subsidies, and potentially other funding mechanisms. Bus riders do not subsidize the train; they pay for their own bus services. Therefore, the claim is false.

1291,"Explanation: Drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and in parts of Alaska can indeed increase domestic oil production, which can help reduce dependence on foreign oil. However, it's important to note that this process takes time. Oil exploration and production can take several years from discovery to actual production. Additionally, the claim that it will ""immediately"" reduce dependence is an oversimplification. While increased domestic production can help, it's not a quick fix. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
1292,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support the claim that a lawyer demanded several Houston pastors hand over their private papers, including their sermons.

Without specific data points, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

1294,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made derogatory remarks about Israel and the United States in the past, there is no evidence to suggest that he made these specific statements ""just days ago"" or that he will oversee the implementation of any agreement. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of past statements.

For instance, during his 2016 presidential campaign, he was the target of several negative ads, particularly from the Republican Party and super PACs.

Answer: 0"
1301,"Explanation: The claim that the majority of Sherrod Brown's campaign contributions came from outside of the state of Ohio is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
1302,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25 per hour, not $7.75. The poverty level for a single person in 2021 was $12,880 per year, or $107.33 per month. At a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, a full-time worker would earn $15,080 per year, which is above the poverty level.

Answer: 0"
1303,"Explanation: The claim that Jasper County in Texas raised property taxes by 7 percent to pay for one death penalty case is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim. Property taxes are typically raised to fund various public services and infrastructure, not to pay for specific legal cases. Additionally, the cost of a death penalty case is usually covered by the state, not the county.

Answer: 0"
1304,"Explanation: The claim that the Clinton campaign was the first to raise concerns about Melania Trump's speech is not accurate. The initial criticism of Melania Trump's speech was not from the Clinton campaign but from various media outlets and political figures who pointed out similarities between her speech and Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Convention speech.

1314,"Explanation: The claim that students who receive free or reduced lunch are performing just as well as students who do not is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some students receiving free or reduced lunch may perform well, research has shown that there is often a correlation between socioeconomic status and academic achievement. Students from lower-income backgrounds may face additional challenges such as lack of resources, unstable housing, and increased stress, which can negatively impact their academic performance. Therefore, while there are exceptions, the claim that these students perform just as well as those from higher-income backgrounds is an oversimplification.

1333,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) will cause up to 20 million Americans to lose the insurance they currently have and want to keep is misleading. While it's true that some people may lose their insurance due to changes in eligibility or affordability, the overall impact is more nuanced. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage, not to reduce it. Many people who were previously uninsured or had inadequate coverage have gained access to better insurance options through the ACA. The claim of 20 million people losing insurance is often cited in the context of the individual mandate and the potential for increased premiums, but it's important to note that these changes were intended to balance the system and ensure that everyone had access to affordable healthcare.

It does not give bureaucrats the authority to decide whether individuals receive care such as dialysis or cancer chemotherapy. The ACA primarily focuses on expanding access to healthcare, ensuring that individuals have access to preventive care, and protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions. Decisions about medical treatment are made by healthcare providers, not bureaucrats.
