She appeared before the House Select Committee on Benghazi in 2015 and 2016, and also testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2016. Therefore, the claim that she refuses to testify is false.

Answer: 0"
1,"Explanation: The claim that Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson appears to endorse world government is a misinterpretation of his statements. In a 2010 interview, Bryson discussed the need for international cooperation and the potential benefits of a global economy, but he did not explicitly endorse a world government. His comments were more about the importance of international trade and cooperation rather than advocating for a single global government.

Answer: 0"
2,"Explanation: The claim that Rob Portman voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns is false. In 2015, Portman voted against a bill that would have allowed individuals on the terrorism watch list to purchase firearms. He has consistently supported measures to prevent individuals on the watch list from obtaining guns.

Answer: 0"
3,"Explanation: The claim that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was released by Obama in 2009 is false. Al-Baghdadi was captured by U.S. forces in Iraq in 2004 and was held in Camp Bucca prison. He was released in 2009, but this was due to a lack of evidence to keep him in custody, not because of any action by President Obama. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
4,"Explanation: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has historically opposed expanded background checks for gun purchases. The NRA has argued that such checks would infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens and would not prevent gun violence. Therefore, the claim that the NRA used to support expanded background checks is false.

Answer: 0"
5,"Explanation: The claim that you have gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party is false. The claim is made by Donald Trump, who has indeed won the Republican primaries in 2016 and 2020. However, the claim that he has gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party is not accurate. The most votes in a Republican primary were received by Mitt Romney in 2012, who won the Republican nomination but lost the general election to Barack Obama.

Answer: 0"
6,"Explanation: The claim that when the New Hampshire Legislature raised the gasoline tax, gas prices in the state were skyrocketing is not accurate. While it is true that the gasoline tax was raised, the claim that gas prices skyrocketed is an exaggeration. Gas prices in New Hampshire did increase, but the increase was not disproportionately higher than the increase in other states or the national average. The claim is misleading and does not accurately reflect the relationship between the tax increase and gas prices.

Answer: 0"
7,"Explanation: The claim that there has been bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives for the repeal of Obamacare, getting rid of cap and trade, and building the Keystone Pipeline is misleading. While there have been attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) with bipartisan support, the repeal efforts have not been successful. Additionally, there has been bipartisan support for the Keystone Pipeline, but the claim that there has been bipartisan support for getting rid of cap and trade is false. Cap and trade is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and it has bipartisan support in some forms, but the claim that there has been bipartisan support for getting rid of it is an oversimplification.

Answer: 0"
8,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government has not announced a plan to spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year. The U.S. has been reducing its military presence and aid in Afghanistan, not increasing it. Additionally, the claim that the U.S. is cutting the same things in its own country is not supported by any official statements or plans.

Answer: 0"
9,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the wrong precinct rules exacerbate provisional ballot problems and that HB 194 does nothing to solve this issue. However, without specific information about the content of HB 194 and the exact nature of the wrong precinct rules, it is difficult to definitively judge the claim. If HB 194 is intended to address the wrong precinct problem but fails to do so, then the claim would be true. If HB 194 does address the issue, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0/1"
10,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower has been widely debunked. Multiple investigations and reports have found no evidence to support this claim. The Trump Organization has stated that all workers were legally employed and had proper documentation. Furthermore, the Trump Tower was built in the 1980s, and the immigration laws and practices were different at that time compared to today's standards.

Answer: 0"
11,"Explanation: Sharron Angle, a former U.S. Senator from Nevada, did propose to eliminate the Department of Education during her 2010 Senate campaign. She argued that education should be handled at the state and local levels, and that the federal government should have less involvement. However, this was a campaign promise and not a policy that was implemented during her time in office.

Answer: 1"
12,"Explanation: The claim that BP's $20 billion fund to compensate oil spill victims is a ""slush fund"" is false. A slush fund is typically used to describe a fund that is used for discretionary or non-transparent purposes. However, BP's $20 billion fund was established as part of a legal settlement to compensate victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The fund was set up to provide compensation to individuals and businesses affected by the spill, and it was overseen by a court-appointed administrator. Therefore, the fund was not intended for discretionary use and was not a slush fund.

Answer: 0"
13,"Explanation: The claim that ""on in-state tuition for illegal immigrants"" is generally false. In-state tuition is typically reserved for residents of a particular state, and many states have laws that prevent illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition rates. However, some states have policies that allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates, but this is not universal and varies by state. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
14,"Explanation: The claim states that ""the five economic indicators that the federal government tracks - for the first time since August 2006 - were positive this October."" This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that all five economic indicators were positive for the first time since August 2006. Economic indicators such as GDP, employment, and inflation have shown positive trends in recent months, but it is not accurate to say that all five indicators were positive for the first time since August 2006.

Answer: 0"
15,"Explanation: The claim is comparing annual deficits under Republican administrations with monthly deficits under Democratic administrations. This is a misleading comparison because annual deficits are typically reported on an annual basis, while monthly deficits are reported on a monthly basis. The claim suggests that the annual deficits under Republicans have somehow become monthly deficits under Democrats, which is not a valid comparison. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
16,"Explanation: The claim states that a poll shows Democrats are just one point behind Gov. John Kasich without a name attached. However, the claim does not provide any specific details about the poll, such as the source, date, or methodology. Without this information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
17,"Explanation: The claim that we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country is not accurate. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but it is not twice as much as other countries. For example, in 2019, the U.S. spent $10,966 per capita, while countries like Germany and Japan spent around $5,000 per capita. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
18,"Explanation: The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, established the direct election of U.S. senators by popular vote. It replaced the previous system where senators were elected by state legislatures. Therefore, the claim that ""On repealing the 17th Amendment"" is false because the 17th Amendment has already been ratified and is part of the U.S. Constitution.

Answer: 0"
19,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the property taxes decreased due to a reduction in the technical college portion of the taxes, which was attributed to state funding. However, without specific details or evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Property tax rates can be influenced by various factors, including local budgets, state funding, and other political decisions. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
20,"Explanation: The claim that minors find it easier to get marijuana than alcohol is not universally supported by studies. While some studies may suggest that minors can more easily access marijuana, others indicate that access to alcohol is also a significant issue. The ease of access to these substances can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, local laws, and enforcement. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that minors find it ""very easy"" to get marijuana compared to alcohol.

Answer: 0"
21,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump is false. The Keystone XL pipeline was not a significant factor in determining gasoline prices. Gasoline prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global oil supply and demand, refinery capacity, and geopolitical events. The Keystone XL pipeline was one of many proposed projects, and its cancellation did not directly impact gasoline prices at the pump.

Answer: 0"
22,"Explanation: The claim that she is the subject of 60 books is not verifiable with the information provided. Without specific details about the books, authors, or context, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
23,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Perry pointed out that Social Security has been a failure is a misrepresentation of his actual stance. In reality, Gov. Perry has been a critic of Social Security's long-term sustainability and has proposed reforms to address its financial challenges. However, he has not outright stated that Social Security has been a failure. The claim is an exaggeration and a distortion of his actual views.

Answer: 0"
24,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has indeed reduced the number of uninsured Americans, but the reduction is not 3 percent for $2 trillion. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the uninsured rate in the U.S. decreased from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2019. The cost of the ACA is estimated to be around $1.2 trillion over 10 years, not $2 trillion.

Answer: 0"
25,"Explanation: The claim that we import more oil today than ever before is not accurate. While global oil consumption has been increasing, the peak of oil imports occurred in the 1970s due to the oil crisis. Since then, oil production and imports have fluctuated, but the overall trend has been a decrease in oil imports as a percentage of total oil consumption. This is due to increased domestic production and the development of alternative energy sources.

Answer: 0"
26,"Explanation: The claim that Will Hurd tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record is false. Will Hurd, a former Republican Congressman from Texas, was known for his moderate views and was often critical of his party's leadership. He voted with his party on most issues but was not as consistently conservative as the claim suggests. His voting record was more nuanced and varied, not strictly 96 percent Republican.

Answer: 0"
27,"Explanation: The claim that Greece is about the size of metropolitan Miami is incorrect. As of 2021, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Greece was approximately $243 billion, while the GDP of Miami-Dade County, which is the metropolitan area of Miami, was around $347 billion. Therefore, Greece is not comparable in size to Miami in terms of economic output.

Answer: 0"
28,"Explanation: The claim that ""forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children"" is a misinterpretation of the national debt. The national debt is the total amount of money the federal government has borrowed to finance its spending. It is not accurate to say that this debt is being borrowed from ""my children"" as it is a collective responsibility of the entire population. The debt is a result of the government's spending and is not directly borrowed from individuals.

Answer: 0"
29,"Explanation: Cigarette butts are indeed a significant source of litter and can pose a risk to children and pets if ingested. However, the claim that they specifically poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them is misleading. While nicotine is a harmful substance, the primary danger from cigarette butts is the ingestion of the toxic chemicals and tar present in the butts, not the nicotine itself. Additionally, the amount of nicotine in a single cigarette butt is not sufficient to cause poisoning in a child.

Answer: 0"
30,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, in a press release. The press release provides data from the Georgia Department of Labor, which shows that since Governor Kemp took office in January 2018, there have been 319,000 new private sector jobs created in Georgia, with nearly 93,000 of those coming in the past 12 months. The data is sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is considered reliable.

Answer: 1"
31,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama was proposing ""pinprick strikes"" for military intervention in Syria is false. The term ""pinprick strikes"" is not a recognized military strategy and was not used by President Obama or his administration. The U.S. military intervention in Syria, which began in 2014, involved airstrikes and other forms of military action, but not ""pinprick strikes.""

Answer: 0"
32,"Explanation: The claim that there are no political prisoners in Cuba is false. According to various human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, Cuba has a history of detaining and imprisoning individuals for their political beliefs and activities. These prisoners are often held without fair trials and subjected to harsh conditions.

Answer: 0"
33,"Explanation: The claim is about a change in a political figure's stance on a specific policy. Without specific context or a source, it's difficult to verify the exact nature of the change. However, if the claim is about a public figure's policy shift, it is generally true that politicians can change their positions over time. Therefore, the claim could be true depending on the specific context and the source of the information.

Answer: 1"
34,"Explanation: The claim is false. John Edwards, a former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate, was indeed a strong advocate for universal healthcare during his 2004 presidential campaign. He proposed a plan called ""Healthcare for All Americans,"" which aimed to provide universal healthcare coverage. Therefore, the statement that he wasn't for universal healthcare in 2004 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
35,"Explanation: The claim states that Multnomah County libraries are open 44 hours per week, which is the lowest of any library in the four-county region. To verify this claim, I would need to check the actual operating hours of Multnomah County libraries and compare them with the operating hours of libraries in the other three counties in the region. Without specific data, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
36,"Explanation: Mike Huckabee has indeed appeared in infomercials promoting products and treatments for diabetes. However, it is important to note that these products and treatments are not endorsed by any major health agency. The claim is true because it accurately states that Huckabee has appeared in infomercials promoting diabetes treatments that are not supported by health agencies.

Answer: 1"
37,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not released any specific data or reports indicating that its regulation of greenhouse gases will endanger 575 Texas dairy facilities, 58 swine operations, 1,300 corn farms, and 28,000 beef cattle operations. The EPA's regulations on greenhouse gases are aimed at reducing emissions from various sources, including power plants, vehicles, and industrial facilities, but the specific numbers provided in the claim are not supported by any official EPA data or reports.

Answer: 0"
38,"Explanation: The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) is a proposed law that would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment. It does not target or discriminate against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, or the rights of religious freedom. In fact, ENDA is designed to protect individuals from discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, which are protected classes under the law. The claim that ENDA discriminates against religious groups is a misinterpretation of the law's purpose and intent.

Answer: 0"
39,"Explanation: The claim is false. John McCain, a Republican Senator, did not vote against the Bush tax cuts. In fact, he voted for the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. He later supported making them permanent, but he did not vote against them originally.

Answer: 0"
40,"Explanation: South Florida, particularly the Miami-Dade County area, is known for having a higher mosquito population compared to many other regions in the United States. This is due to the warm climate, abundant water sources, and the presence of invasive species like the Asian tiger mosquito. The Florida Department of Health and other local authorities often report higher mosquito activity in this region, which supports the claim.

Answer: 1"
41,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that the City of Philadelphia and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, there is no evidence to support the claim that crime went down by 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual impact of the investment.

Answer: 0"
42,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island has one of the 10 strictest gun laws among all the states is not accurate. According to the Gun Violence Archive and other sources, Rhode Island has relatively moderate gun laws compared to other states. While it does have some strict regulations, such as a requirement for a permit to purchase a firearm and a ban on certain types of assault weapons, it does not rank among the top 10 states with the strictest gun laws.

Answer: 0"
43,"Explanation: The claim that 2011 was the worst drought year ever recorded in the region is not accurate. While 2011 was a severe drought year, it is not accurate to say it was the worst ever recorded. Droughts are often measured by their severity, duration, and impact, and there have been other years with more severe droughts in the region. For example, the drought of 1934, known as the Dust Bowl, was one of the most severe droughts in U.S. history and had a significant impact on the region.

Answer: 0"
44,"Explanation: The claim that ""In the 1980s, the lowest income people had the biggest gains"" is false. During the 1980s, there was a significant increase in income inequality in the United States. While the overall economy grew, the gains were not evenly distributed. The top income earners saw substantial increases in their incomes, while the lowest income earners saw little to no increase. This period is often referred to as the ""Great Divergence"" due to the widening gap between the rich and the poor.

Answer: 0"
45,"Explanation: The claim that for every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps is a misinterpretation of data. The claim is based on a study by the Heritage Foundation, which suggested that for every job created by the stimulus package, 75 people were added to the food stamp rolls. However, this study was criticized for its methodology and the way it interpreted the data. The claim does not accurately reflect the relationship between job creation and food stamp usage during the Obama administration.

Answer: 0"
46,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that solar energy can be efficiently collected and transmitted over long distances. While it is true that the Southwestern desert has high solar radiation, the claim does not account for several factors:
1. **Efficiency of Solar Panels**: Solar panels are not 100% efficient. They typically convert around 15-20% of the sunlight they receive into electricity.
2. **Transmission Losses**: Transmitting electricity over long distances results in significant losses. The claim does not consider the infrastructure needed to transmit this energy efficiently.
3. **Storage and Distribution**: Solar energy is intermittent, requiring storage solutions like batteries. The claim does not address the need for storage and distribution infrastructure.
4. **Geographical Distribution**: The claim assumes that all the energy can be collected and used in one area, ignoring the need for a nationwide grid and distribution system.

Answer: 0"
47,"Explanation: Bernie Sanders has been a consistent advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, including same-sex marriage, for many years. In 2000, he voted against a bill that would have allowed same-sex couples to marry in Vermont, but he has since changed his stance and has been a strong supporter of same-sex marriage. Therefore, the claim that he was there when it came to same-sex marriage 20 years ago is true.

Answer: 1"
48,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as ObamaCare, does not require all persons enrolled in insurance plans to pay an abortion premium. The ACA prohibits federal funds from being used to pay for abortions, but it does not mandate that all insurance plans cover abortions. Additionally, the ACA allows states to opt out of covering abortions in their Medicaid programs. Therefore, the claim that the administration has issued rules for $1 abortions and requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay an abortion premium is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
49,"Explanation: Rick Perry served as the Governor of Texas from 2007 to 2015. Before his political career, he worked as a businessman and ran a family business. Therefore, the claim that he has never held a private-sector job is false.

Answer: 0"
50,"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs state taxpayers over $3 billion every year is often cited in political debates but is not supported by comprehensive, widely accepted studies. The $3 billion figure is often derived from a 2017 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which has been criticized for its methodology and bias. Other studies and analyses have found that the economic impact of illegal immigration is more nuanced and often positive, with immigrants contributing to the economy through taxes and labor. Therefore, the claim is not supported by reliable, widely accepted evidence.

Answer: 0"
51,"Explanation: The claim states that a liberal immigration reform group endorsed Dave Brat, a GOP primary opponent. However, there is no specific mention of which liberal immigration reform group is being referred to, and no evidence is provided to support this claim. Without specific details or credible sources, it is not possible to verify the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
52,"Explanation: The claim that welders make more money than philosophers is not universally true. The income of individuals in these professions can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, experience, education, and specific job roles. While welders in certain industries or regions may earn more than philosophers, the reverse can also be true in other contexts. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that welders always make more money than philosophers.

Answer: 0"
53,"Explanation: Teddy Roosevelt did advocate for health care reform, but the claim that he ""first called for (health care) reform nearly a century ago"" is misleading. Roosevelt's advocacy for health care reform was in the early 20th century, but the term ""nearly a century ago"" suggests a much earlier time period. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
54,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific record for fundraising in a U.S. Senate race in Florida that Charlie Crist has broken. The claim is not supported by any verifiable information or sources. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
56,"Explanation: The claim that Debra Medina was the No. 1 search on Google for the hour after the debate on Jan. 14 and No. 3 for the remainder of that night is not verifiable. Google does not publicly release search data for specific individuals or timeframes, and such claims are often made without credible sources. Therefore, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
57,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by John Brennan, the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), regarding the geographic limitations of drone strikes. However, the claim does not provide a specific source or context for Brennan's statement, making it difficult to verify its authenticity. Without a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm whether Brennan made this statement or not.

60,"Explanation: The claim states that 85% of recent college graduates are moving back in with their parents after four years of a celebrity president. However, there is no specific data or source provided to support this claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify which celebrity president is being referred to, making it difficult to attribute the trend to a specific individual. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and lacks sufficient evidence to be considered true.

62,"Explanation: The claim is true. The U.S. tax code has indeed seen numerous changes and additions since 1986, including new tax preferences and loopholes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, for instance, introduced several new provisions and changes to the tax code. Therefore, the statement that there have been ""literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986"" is accurate.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0"
65,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want to raise taxes on all income brackets is a generalization that is not accurate. While both have proposed tax increases on higher income brackets, they have not advocated for raising taxes on all income brackets. Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign platform included proposals to increase the top marginal tax rate and close loopholes for the wealthy, but she did not propose a tax increase for all income brackets. Similarly, Barack Obama's tax policies during his presidency focused on increasing taxes for the wealthy and closing loopholes, but he did not propose a tax increase for all income brackets. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
66,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss votes more with Democrats than with conservatives is false. Chambliss is a Republican and has consistently voted with the Republican Party. According to the Washington Post's ""Congressional Voting Score"" for the 116th Congress, Chambliss voted with Republicans 95% of the time and with Democrats 5% of the time. This indicates that he is a conservative and votes primarily with his party.

Answer: 0"
67,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific political campaign's fundraising performance, which is typically a matter of public record. Campaign finance reports are usually filed with government agencies and are publicly accessible. Therefore, it is possible to verify the claim by checking the relevant campaign finance reports. However, without access to the specific reports or additional context, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"

Answer: 0"
69,"Explanation: The claim that this is the first time since World War II that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together is false. There have been instances in the past where multiple nuclear-powered aircraft carriers have been docked together. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Harry S. Truman, were docked together in the Persian Gulf. Additionally, the U.S. Navy has conducted exercises with multiple carriers in the past, such as the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, where multiple carriers have been present.

Answer: 0"
70,"Explanation: The claim states that at 50 Milwaukee schools serving at least 80% African-American and at least 80% low-income students, the reading proficiency is 8%. This claim is false because it is not supported by any credible sources or data. The claim does not provide any specific data or references to back up the 8% reading proficiency figure. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
71,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not mandate that small businesses adopt a specific health care plan. Instead, it provides options for small businesses to offer health insurance to their employees. The penalty for not offering health insurance to employees is not a fine but a tax on the employer if they have 50 or more full-time equivalent employees and do not offer affordable health insurance. Additionally, the ACA does not apply to businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

Answer: 0"
72,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin has fallen to dead last in Midwest job growth is based on the latest job numbers. To verify this claim, I would need to check the most recent job growth data for Wisconsin and compare it with other Midwest states.

Answer: 0"
73,"Explanation: The claim refers to the Baucus bill, which is a reference to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) proposed by Senator Max Baucus. The ACA, as passed, does not provide federal funds to subsidize coverage of elective abortions. The ACA includes provisions that prohibit federal funds from being used for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
74,"Explanation: The claim that ""Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans"" is not accurate. While there are varying opinions on cap-and-trade policies, numerous polls and surveys have shown that a significant portion of Americans support or are neutral towards such policies. For instance, a 2021 poll by the Yale Climate Communications program found that 69% of Americans support a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the claim that cap-and-trade is ""wildly unpopular"" is an oversimplification and not supported by data.

Answer: 0"

The Parent Trigger legislation was introduced by a group of parents and educators in California in 2010, and it was later adopted by several states. It is not accurate to attribute the drafting of this legislation to the top advisers of either President Obama or President Clinton.

Answer: 0"
78,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the current oil imports to the amount on the day Senator McCain took office, which was in 2009. However, the claim does not specify the time period for the current imports, making it impossible to verify the claim without additional context. Therefore, the claim is false as it stands because it lacks specific information to support the comparison.

Answer: 0"
79,"Explanation: The claim that four-year terms for City Council members are the norm in most cities of our size is not accurate. The term length for City Council members varies widely across different cities and countries. While some cities do have four-year terms, many others have two-year terms, and some even have terms of three years or more. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that four-year terms are the norm.

Answer: 0"
80,"Explanation: Tommy Thompson is indeed known for his role in welfare reform, but he is not the father of the Wisconsin Works program. The program was created by Governor James E. Doyle in 1996, not by Tommy Thompson. Thompson served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2001 to 2003 and was a key figure in the implementation of welfare reform, but he did not create the Wisconsin Works program.

Answer: 0"
81,"Explanation: The claim that ""We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before"" is not accurate. While the United States has seen an increase in exports in recent years, this does not necessarily mean that the volume of products made in America and sold to the rest of the world is at an all-time high. The claim is misleading because it does not provide context or specify the time period being compared.

Answer: 0"
82,"Explanation: The claim that the costs of cancer and all affiliated issues are over $20 billion a year to this state is not accurate. According to the American Cancer Society, the estimated cost of cancer care in the United States in 2020 was $174 billion. This figure includes direct medical costs, indirect costs (such as lost productivity), and other related expenses. Therefore, the claim that the costs are over $20 billion a year is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
83,"Explanation: The claim ""On a cap-and-trade plan"" is incomplete and lacks context. A cap-and-trade plan is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, where a limit (cap) is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted, and companies can trade emission allowances. Without additional information about the specific context or details of the claim, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
84,"Explanation: The claim that ""The left is blatantly attempting to disrupt Georgia's elections"" is a broad and vague statement that lacks specific evidence or context. Without concrete examples or sources, it is difficult to verify the truth of this claim. Additionally, the term ""the left"" is not defined, and it could refer to various political groups or individuals with different motivations and actions. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
85,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011 is false. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2010, included provisions aimed at reducing prescription drug costs, such as the closing of the Medicare Part D doughnut hole, the specific claim about reducing costs for 3.6 million Americans in 2011 is not accurate. The ACA's provisions to reduce prescription drug costs were implemented over time and did not result in a specific number of Americans seeing reduced costs in 2011.

Answer: 0"
86,"Explanation: Ted Cruz has been a vocal opponent of illegal immigration and has not proposed giving work permits to people in the country illegally. He has consistently advocated for stricter immigration policies, including the construction of a border wall and the deportation of undocumented immigrants. Therefore, the claim that Ted Cruz is a supporter of legalizing people in the country illegally and proposed giving them work permits is false.

Answer: 0"
87,"Explanation: The claim that AIG received a provision allowing it to dole out bonuses is false. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was established by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system during the 2008 financial crisis. AIG received $182 billion in bailout funds, but the government did not allow AIG to pay bonuses to its executives. In fact, the government initially prohibited AIG from paying bonuses to its executives, but later allowed it to pay bonuses to certain employees under strict conditions. The claim that AIG received a provision allowing it to dole out bonuses is a misinterpretation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
88,"Explanation: The claim states that former U.S. President Barack Obama bombed 7 countries and former President George W. Bush bombed 4 countries. This claim is false. According to various sources, including the Council on Foreign Relations and the New York Times, the number of countries bombed by Obama and Bush is significantly higher. For example, Obama bombed at least 10 countries, and Bush bombed at least 12 countries. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

91,"Explanation: The claim is true. Virginia has been exploring the possibility of offshore oil and natural gas production for several years. In 2020, the state's General Assembly passed a law allowing for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in state waters. This makes Virginia the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore.

Answer: 1"
92,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the position of the McCain campaign to that of Vice President Gore's campaign one week before the 2000 election. In 2000, the election was extremely close, with Gore leading in the polls but ultimately losing to George W. Bush. The McCain campaign, on the other hand, was not in a similar position. John McCain was not leading in the polls and was not in a close race with Barack Obama, who ultimately won the 2008 election. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
93,"Explanation: The claim that ""Health care reform: Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care"" is a generalization and an oversimplification. Health care reform can have various impacts depending on the specific policies and measures implemented. Some reforms may indeed increase costs or taxes, but others aim to reduce costs, improve access, and enhance quality. The claim does not provide specific examples or evidence to support its assertions, making it difficult to judge its accuracy without more context.

Answer: 0"
94,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has spent trillions of dollars since 1965 yet the poverty rate has not budged is misleading. While it is true that the United States has spent significant amounts on various social programs and initiatives aimed at reducing poverty, the poverty rate has indeed fluctuated over time. The poverty rate has decreased in some periods and increased in others, but it has not remained static. For instance, the poverty rate was around 15% in the 1960s, dropped to around 11% in the 1970s, and has fluctuated since then, reaching a low of 11.3% in 2000 and a high of 15.1% in 2010. Therefore, the claim that the poverty rate has not budged is false.

Answer: 0"
95,"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's data, several states have seen a decrease in spending on higher education since the beginning of the decade. For instance, states like California, Florida, and Texas have also experienced a decline in higher education spending. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
96,"Explanation: The claim that a million people come into the U.S. legally each year is not accurate. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the number of people who obtain lawful permanent resident status (green card) annually is around 1 million, but this includes both new immigrants and those who adjust their status. However, the number of new immigrants (those who are not already in the U.S. and obtain a green card) is significantly lower. The claim that no other country comes close to this figure is also misleading, as many countries have similar or higher numbers of legal immigrants.

Answer: 0"
97,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush, a Republican, did not expand government health care. Instead, it created a new program called Medicare Part D, which provides prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. This program was not an expansion of government health care but rather a new addition to the existing Medicare program.

Answer: 0"
98,"Explanation: The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a trade agreement between 12 countries, including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.

99,"Explanation: The claim is false. The unemployment rate in Shelby County, Tennessee, was indeed 4.8% when Congressman Steve Cohen took office in 2007.

The unemployment rate in Shelby County has fluctuated over the years, but it has not reached 9.7% as of the latest data available.

Answer: 0"
100,"Explanation: The claim that the Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country is not accurate. While the Koch brothers, through their companies, have been involved in various industries that contribute to pollution, such as fossil fuel extraction and manufacturing, they are not among the top polluters in the country. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists the top polluters by industry, and the Koch brothers' companies are not among the top emitters of greenhouse gases or other pollutants.

Answer: 0"
101,"Explanation: The claim that Texas is the only state that exempts jet fuel from its state motor fuels tax is false. While Texas does have a unique tax structure for jet fuel, it is not the only state that exempts jet fuel from its motor fuels tax. Several other states, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Wyoming, also have similar exemptions. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
102,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the likelihood of a baby being born to a mother who used tobacco during pregnancy in Coos County is twice the average for Oregon or the U.S. This claim is not supported by any specific data or study that I can find. The likelihood of a baby being born to a mother who used tobacco during pregnancy can vary based on numerous factors, including regional health trends, socioeconomic factors, and access to healthcare. Without specific data or a study to back up this claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
103,"Explanation: The claim states that neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years. To verify this, I would need to check the official records or reports from the county government regarding the funding allocated to the school systems over the past six years. Without specific data or official statements, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific data.)"
104,"Explanation: The claim ""On reconciliation"" is incomplete and lacks context. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
105,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time data to verify the current unemployment rate in Virginia. However, historical data shows that the unemployment rate in Virginia has been relatively low in recent years, but it's not accurate to say it's the lowest in Virginia history without specific data points. The claim could be true or false depending on the exact time frame and data source.

Answer: 0/1"
106,"Explanation: The claim that Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education is not accurate. According to reliable sources, the budget cuts for education in Trenton were significantly lower than $1.3 billion. The actual cuts were around $100 million, which is a substantial amount but not $1.3 billion. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and false.

Answer: 0"
107,"Explanation: The claim is false. Colorado does not have a law that allows residents to print ballots from their home computers and then encourages them to turn ballots over to collectors. Colorado's mail-in voting system does allow residents to request and receive ballots by mail, but the process does not involve printing ballots at home. Additionally, the practice of ""ballot harvesting"" is illegal in Colorado, where it is a felony to collect and submit ballots on behalf of others.

Answer: 0"
108,"Explanation: The claim that ""not a single soldier died in combat during the Eisenhower Administration"" is false. During the Eisenhower Administration, which lasted from 1953 to 1961, the United States was involved in the Korean War and the early stages of the Vietnam War. Both of these conflicts resulted in American casualties. For example, the Korean War alone resulted in over 36,000 American deaths.

Answer: 0"
109,"Explanation: The Keystone XL pipeline is a proposed oil pipeline that would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States. The pipeline has been a subject of controversy and debate, with some supporting its construction for economic reasons and others opposing it due to environmental concerns. The claim itself does not provide specific information that can be verified as true or false, as it is a general statement about the pipeline. Therefore, without additional context or specific claims, it is not possible to definitively judge the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"

112,"Explanation: The claim that by 2015, the United States would be sending so much interest to China that it would be paying for the entire People's Liberation Army is highly unlikely and not supported by any credible sources. The claim is hyperbolic and does not reflect the actual economic and political dynamics between the U.S. and China. The U.S. does not have the capability or intention to finance the entire Chinese military.

Answer: 0"
113,"Explanation: The Budget Control Act of 2011 was indeed passed by the U.S. Senate, along with the U.S. House of Representatives, and signed into law by President Barack Obama.

Answer: 1"
114,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Medicare officials have treated Humana and AARP differently in terms of communication with seniors. However, there is no specific evidence or source provided to support this claim. Medicare's communication policies are typically consistent and based on regulations and guidelines, not on the specific organization or entity they are communicating with. Therefore, the claim is not supported by available information.

Answer: 0"
115,"Explanation: The Islamic State (ISIS) is known for its extremist activities and has been involved in various atrocities, including the destruction of cultural heritage sites. However, building a hotel is not a typical activity associated with ISIS. The group is more focused on military operations, propaganda, and the establishment of a caliphate rather than constructing hotels. Therefore, this claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
116,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Iranians are now stating that their understanding of the deal differs from what was previously stated. This claim is not verifiable with concrete evidence or a specific source. It is a general statement that could be true or false depending on the context and the specific deal being referred to. Without additional context or a reliable source, it is impossible to definitively judge the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
117,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has 77 different means-tested social welfare programs is not accurate. While the federal government does have numerous social welfare programs, the exact number of means-tested programs can vary depending on the source and the definition of ""means-tested."" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 80 means-tested programs, but this number can fluctuate. Therefore, the claim of 77 programs is not precise and can be considered false.

Answer: 0"
118,"Explanation: The claim ""I have returned money every year since taking office"" is vague and lacks specific details. It does not provide information about the amount of money returned, the context in which it was returned, or the specific years in question. Without concrete evidence or a clear definition of what ""returning money"" means in this context, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"

According to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, the number of immigrants detained annually has been fluctuating but has not increased dramatically from about 70,000 to 400,000 in the last 15 years. The actual numbers are much lower and have not shown such a significant increase.

Answer: 1"
121,"Explanation: The claim that the approval rating of Congress is down to 13 percent is false.

Answer: 0"
123,"Explanation: The claim that the United States incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did is false. While it is true that the United States has a disproportionately high rate of incarceration for African-Americans, the percentage of the population incarcerated in South Africa during apartheid was significantly higher. According to various studies and historical records, the incarceration rate in South Africa during apartheid was around 10-15% of the African population, while in the United States, the incarceration rate for African-Americans is around 1-2%.

Answer: 0"
124,"Explanation: The claim is based on specific percentages of Texas high school students meeting college readiness standards in English and math. These figures are not widely reported or verified in standard educational databases or reports. To verify the claim, one would need to consult official Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board reports or other credible educational sources. Without such verification, the claim cannot be confirmed as true.

125,"Explanation: Georgia is indeed known for its high standards in food safety, particularly in the production of peanuts and other agricultural products. The state has implemented stringent regulations and inspections to ensure the quality and safety of its food products. This reputation is well-recognized in the industry and among consumers.

Answer: 1"
126,"Explanation: The claim is false. The fiscal cliff refers to a series of tax increases and spending cuts that were scheduled to take effect at the beginning of 2013. However, lawmakers did not fail to avert the fiscal cliff. In fact, they passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which averted the fiscal cliff and prevented the automatic spending cuts and tax increases. Therefore, the claim that 18 percent of the federal money sent to the states would be eliminated is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
127,"Explanation: The claim that the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000 in 2011 is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average annual salary for elementary, middle, and high school teachers in the Milwaukee metropolitan area in 2011 was around $55,000 to $60,000. This is significantly lower than the claimed $100,000.

128,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal eliminates Medicare in 10 years is false. While Ryan's budget proposals have included changes to Medicare, such as raising the eligibility age and changing the way benefits are calculated, they do not eliminate Medicare entirely.

He was known for his work on issues such as economic development, education, and healthcare.

This claim appears to be a misrepresentation of his political stance or actions.

Answer: 0"
132,"Explanation: The claim that Bill White offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants is false. Bill White is a former mayor of Houston, Texas, and he has not been reported to have offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants. The term ""sanctuary city"" typically refers to cities that have policies in place to protect undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement, but there is no evidence to suggest that Bill White has implemented such policies.

The platform has consistently included an exception for rape, incest, or the life of the mother. The claim that the platform has been silent on this exception for more than 30 years is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
134,"Explanation: The claim is false. The new Arizona immigration law, known as SB 1070, allows police to stop and check the immigration status of anyone they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" to believe is in the country illegally. This means that police can stop someone based on factors such as their appearance, behavior, or other indicators, not just if they see something illegal.

Answer: 0"
135,"Explanation: The claim is false. Fox News did not use a photo of a married couple promoting traditional marriage that was actually of a same-sex couple. The photo in question was of a married couple, and the story was about their support for traditional marriage. The claim is a misinterpretation of the story's context.

Answer: 0"
136,"Explanation: The claim that every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases, is not universally true. While some studies suggest that a minimum wage increase can lead to a small increase in unemployment, particularly among low-skilled workers, other studies find no significant effect or even a positive effect on employment. The impact of a minimum wage increase on employment depends on various factors, including the size of the increase, the industry, and the overall economic conditions. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time the minimum wage is raised, the number of jobless people increases.

Answer: 0"
137,"Explanation: The claim that Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law is true. In 1973, the Trump Management Company was sued by the Justice Department for discriminatory housing practices. The company was accused of refusing to rent apartments to African-Americans and other minorities. The case was settled out of court, with the Trump Organization agreeing to pay $1 million in damages and to rent apartments to minorities. This incident is well-documented in various sources, including the New York Times and the Washington Post.

Answer: 1"
138,"Explanation: The National Park Service (NPS) is a federal agency in the United States, while the city of Austin is a local government entity. The NPS's annual budget is funded by the federal government and is typically much larger than the budget of a single city. For example, in 2021, the NPS's budget was approximately $3.7 billion, while the city of Austin's budget was around $1.2 billion. Therefore, the claim that the NPS has an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin is false.

Answer: 0"
139,"Explanation: The claim is a statement of irony, not a factual claim. It suggests that it is ironic that First Energy Corp., which supplies electricity to Cleveland Public Power, is also having its name on the football stadium.

Answer: 0"
142,"Explanation: The claim that Virginia's ban on felons from voting is a Jim Crow-era law is false. The Jim Crow laws were a series of state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. These laws were enacted between 1877 and 1950, and they were designed to disenfranchise and discriminate against African Americans. Virginia's current felon disenfranchisement law, which was passed in 1902, is not a Jim Crow-era law. It was passed before the Jim Crow era and was not intended to target African Americans specifically.

Answer: 0"
143,"Explanation: The claim that ""We've broken by millions the all-time record for votes in a GOP presidential primary election"" is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no evidence to support that any GOP presidential primary election has broken the all-time record for votes by millions. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of actual voting numbers.

Answer: 0"
144,"Explanation: The claim that only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teenagers or young people is likely false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021, about 14% of minimum wage workers were between the ages of 16 and 19, and 25% were between the ages of 20 and 24. This means that a significant portion of minimum wage workers are indeed teenagers or young adults, not just one out of 10.

Answer: 0"
146,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the national economic recovery and its impact on state tax revenues and budget surpluses. While it is true that many states have experienced economic growth and increased tax revenues, it is not accurate to say that nearly every state has seen higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses. The economic recovery has been uneven, with some states benefiting more than others. Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0/1"
149,"Explanation: The claim is made by the Trump family, and it is a statement about their net worth when they moved into the White House. The claim is that they had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman. This claim is false because the Trump family's net worth was significantly higher than that of the Truman family when they moved into the White House. The Trump family's net worth was estimated to be around $3.7 billion, while the Truman family's net worth was much lower.

Answer: 0"
150,"Explanation: The claim that easing restrictions on selling alcohol on Sundays will result in more traffic crashes and fatalities is based on the assumption that increased alcohol consumption will lead to more impaired driving. While it is true that alcohol consumption can impair judgment and motor skills, leading to an increased risk of traffic crashes and fatalities, the claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that easing restrictions on Sunday alcohol sales will directly cause more crashes and fatalities. The impact of such a policy change would depend on various factors, including the current alcohol consumption patterns, enforcement of drunk driving laws, and public awareness campaigns.

Answer: 0"
151,"Explanation: The Tea Party is not a registered political party in the United States, and therefore, it does not have official polling data like the Republican and Democratic parties. Polling data for political parties typically refers to the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The claim is comparing a non-registered political movement to registered political parties, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
152,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of individuals on death row who have completed all appellate review and are awaiting the governor's signature on a death warrant is not approximately 40. The actual number is much lower.

Answer: 0"
153,"Explanation: Proposition 57, also known as the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016, is a California ballot initiative that was passed in 2016. It aims to reduce the state prison population by allowing non-violent, non-serious offenders to be eligible for parole after serving the full term of their primary offense. However, it does not provide any form of immunity or ""get out of jail free"" card for violent crimes such as drive-by shootings or discharging guns on a school yard. These actions are still considered serious crimes and would result in severe penalties, including long jail sentences. Therefore, the claim that Proposition 57 would allow individuals to commit these crimes and ""get out of jail free"" is false.

Answer: 0"
154,"Explanation: The claim refers to a group of senators known as the ""Gang of 14,"" which was formed in 2007 to prevent the Senate from becoming gridlocked. The group consisted of seven Republicans and seven Democrats. The claim also mentions that Sen. Obama (Barack Obama) had the opportunity to join this group but chose not to. However, Sen. Obama was not a senator in 2007; he was a senator-elect at the time and was not yet in office. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
155,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Nathan Deal has taken at least $15,600 from the Koch brothers, their businesses, and their employees is false.

Answer: 0"
156,"Explanation: The claim about a man using bath salts and having raccoons set fire inside his home and steal his cell phone is highly unlikely. Bath salts are a type of drug that can cause hallucinations and paranoia, but they do not cause raccoons to set fires or steal cell phones. Raccoons are not known to use tools or set fires, and they typically do not steal cell phones. This claim appears to be a mix of fact and fiction, with the bath salts and raccoons elements being false.

Answer: 0"
157,"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplified calculation that does not account for the fact that Medicare taxes are paid over a lifetime, while benefits are received over a shorter period. The claim also does not consider the fact that Medicare taxes are paid by both the employee and the employer, and that the benefits are not solely for the retiree but also for their spouse and dependents. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that Medicare benefits are not received in a lump sum but are spread out over the retiree's lifetime.

Answer: 0"
158,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker would ban stem cell research is false.

Answer: 0"
159,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific year (2010) and provides a combined figure for the top 10 CEOs' salaries. However, it does not provide a source or specific data to verify the claim. Additionally, the claim about the average American worker's wage rising by just 2 percent is not directly related to the CEOs' salaries and does not provide a source for this information either. Therefore, without a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
160,"Explanation: The claim that law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population is supported by several studies and reports. For instance, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that law enforcement officers have a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other causes compared to the general population. This increased risk is often attributed to the stress and physical demands of the job, as well as exposure to hazards. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
161,"Explanation: The claim that suicide is caused by a federal government policy of giving people something for nothing is a misinterpretation and a false narrative. Suicide is a complex issue influenced by a multitude of factors, including mental health, socioeconomic status, personal relationships, and individual circumstances. The claim suggests a simplistic and inaccurate cause-and-effect relationship between government policies and suicide rates, which is not supported by evidence or expert consensus.

Answer: 0"
162,"Explanation: The claim is false. The House of Representatives has been controlled by the Democratic Party since the 2018 midterm elections. The claim that the House has been malfunctioning due to a lack of control is not accurate. Additionally, the claim that only 49 out of 109 scheduled sessions were held is incorrect. The House has held all of its scheduled sessions.

Answer: 0"
163,"Explanation: The United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) does not infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms. The treaty aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, including small arms and light weapons, to prevent their diversion to unauthorized users. It does not restrict the ownership of firearms within a country's borders. The treaty's provisions are designed to promote responsible arms transfers and prevent the proliferation of weapons that could be used in human rights abuses or terrorism. Therefore, the claim that the U.N. Arms Treaty infringes upon the right to keep and bear arms is false.

Answer: 0"
164,"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the House and Republican, has historically been a skeptic of the scientific consensus on global warming. Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and current Speaker of the House, is a strong advocate for addressing climate change. While both have expressed some willingness to work together on certain issues, their positions on global warming are fundamentally opposed. Therefore, the claim that Newt Gingrich is aligned with Nancy Pelosi on global warming is false.

Answer: 0"
165,"Explanation: The claim that Purim is ""their version of Halloween here"" is false. Purim and Halloween are distinct holidays with different origins, traditions, and purposes. Purim is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people in the ancient Persian Empire from a plot to annihilate them. It is celebrated with a public reading of the Book of Esther, giving gifts to the poor, and a festive meal. In contrast, Halloween is a secular holiday that originated in the United States and is celebrated with activities like trick-or-treating, wearing costumes, and decorating with pumpkins and ghosts. While both holidays involve some form of celebration and dressing up, they are not interchangeable or equivalent.

Answer: 0"
166,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rick Scott, the former governor of Florida, has not been charged with any crime that would lead to imprisonment. He has faced legal challenges and investigations, but none have resulted in criminal charges or imprisonment. Therefore, the claim that he ""barely escaped imprisonment"" is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
167,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the IRS, in 2019, about 44% of Americans did not pay any federal income tax. However, this does not mean that they do not pay any taxes at all. Many Americans pay other types of taxes, such as payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare), state and local taxes, and property taxes. Additionally, the wealthiest Americans do pay a significant portion of the federal income tax. In 2019, the top 1% of earners paid 40.1% of the total federal income tax collected.

Answer: 0"
168,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the assets of the six largest banks in the United States over two different time periods. The first part of the claim states that 15 years ago, the assets of the six largest banks totaled 17 percent of GDP. The second part of the claim states that today, the assets of the six largest banks total 63 percent of GDP. These figures are not directly comparable because they are from different time periods and the economic conditions may have changed significantly over those 15 years. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as it stands without additional context or data.

Answer: 0"
169,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States became a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products in 2019 and has been a net exporter since then. This means that the U.S. produces more oil than it imports from other countries.

Answer: 1"
170,"Explanation: The claim that the largest category of people coming into technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees is likely false. Technical schools typically attract individuals who are seeking vocational training or have completed high school or some college, rather than those with four-year degrees. The primary goal of technical schools is to provide hands-on training for specific trades and industries, which is often more appealing to those who have completed high school or some college-level education.

Answer: 0"
171,"Explanation: The claim that Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years is false. Brazil is still a significant oil producer and exporter. In fact, Brazil is one of the world's largest oil producers, with the discovery of the pre-salt oil fields in the 2000s significantly increasing its oil production. As of 2021, Brazil is the 12th largest oil producer globally and the 10th largest exporter.

Answer: 0"
172,"Explanation: The claim that Louisiana gets ""not one single penny"" from Gulf Coast offshore oil revenues is false. Louisiana does receive revenue from offshore oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The state receives a portion of the revenue generated from leases and sales of oil and gas rights in the federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). This revenue is used for various purposes, including coastal restoration and conservation projects.

Answer: 0"
173,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not make it unlawful for individuals to not purchase health insurance. The ACA's individual mandate, which required most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, was repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. However, the mandate itself was not deemed unlawful; it was simply repealed. Therefore, there is no law that makes not purchasing health insurance unlawful.

Answer: 0"
174,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he lived in a colonia while working as a farm worker"" is vague and lacks specific details.

175,"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold broke his 1992 promise to always get the majority of funding from Wisconsin residents is false. Russ Feingold, a former U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has consistently maintained that he would prioritize funding from Wisconsin residents. There is no evidence to suggest that he has broken this promise.

Answer: 0"
176,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Attorney General of Illinois, a strong Democrat, has stated that causation is the primary factor driving manufacturing jobs out of Illinois. However, there is no specific reference to a statement made by the Attorney General, nor is there any evidence provided to support this claim. Without a credible source or direct quote from the Attorney General, it is not possible to verify the authenticity of this statement.

Answer: 0"
177,"Explanation: The claim that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt felt there was no need for collective bargaining in the public sector because ""the government is the people"" is a misinterpretation of his views. Roosevelt was a strong advocate for labor rights and supported collective bargaining for private sector workers. However, his views on public sector collective bargaining were more nuanced and evolved over time. He initially opposed it, but later supported it, especially after World War II. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

He has publicly stated that he warned Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke about the subprime mortgage crisis. This claim is supported by various news reports and his own statements.

Answer: 1"
180,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia ranks No. 9 in the rate of women murdered by men is not accurate. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the rate of intentional homicide of women by men varies by country, and Georgia does not rank No. 9 in this category. The UNODC's data shows that the rate of intentional homicide of women by men is highest in countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and South Africa, not Georgia.

Answer: 0"
182,"Explanation: The claim is false. Kelly Ayotte, a former U.S. Senator from New Hampshire, voted against a proposal to expand background checks in 2016. However, the claim that ""buyers can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks"" is misleading. The proposal in question was the ""Manchin-Toomey Amendment,"" which would have expanded background checks to cover gun shows and online sales. Ayotte's vote was against this specific proposal, not against background checks in general. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
183,"Explanation: The claim ""I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel"" is vague and lacks specific details. It does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the truthfulness of this statement without additional information.

Answer: 0"
184,"Explanation: Texas law does require schools to teach sex education, but it is not mandatory for schools to teach comprehensive sex education. The Texas Education Code requires that schools provide instruction on human sexuality, but the curriculum must be age-appropriate and medically accurate. However, schools are not required to teach comprehensive sex education, which includes topics like contraception, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Therefore, the claim that ""schools do not even have to teach sex education"" is false.

Answer: 0"
185,"Explanation: The claim that Terry McAuliffe cashed in, walking away with millions from the demise of Global Crossing, is false. Terry McAuliffe was the CEO of Global Crossing from 1999 to 2002. In 2002, Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy, and McAuliffe was accused of fraud and other charges. He was eventually acquitted of all charges in 2005. However, he did not walk away with millions from the demise of the company. Instead, he faced legal troubles and was not involved in any financial gain from the company's collapse.

Answer: 0"
186,"Explanation: The claim that Phoenix is the kidnapping capital of the Western Hemisphere is false. While Phoenix, Arizona, has had a higher rate of kidnappings compared to other cities in the United States, it is not accurate to label it as the ""kidnapping capital"" of the Western Hemisphere. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of data.

According to the DHS website, it reports to the following committees: House Homeland Security Committee, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. While the exact number of committees and subcommittees can vary, the claim that DHS reports to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees is an exaggeration.

190,"Explanation: The claim that Gary Farmers received an A from the NRA is a lie. The National Rifle Association (NRA) does not grade individuals or organizations on a scale of A to F. The NRA is a political advocacy group and does not have a grading system for individuals or organizations. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
191,"Explanation: The claim that Marco Rubio spent $400K of your tax dollars remodeling offices and building a members-only lounge is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim. The U.S. Senate does not have a budget for members-only lounges, and any remodeling of offices would be part of the overall Senate budget, not a separate expense.

Answer: 0"
192,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While it is accurate that certain areas in the United States, such as Oakland and Ferguson, have higher crime rates compared to other parts of the country, it is an oversimplification to say that these places are among the most dangerous in the world. The claim also does not provide context or data to support the assertion that these places are worse than other dangerous areas globally. Additionally, it is important to note that crime rates can vary significantly within a city, and many areas in these cities are not as dangerous as the overall statistics might suggest.

Answer: 0"
193,"Explanation: The claim that Bush's tax cuts for high earners have been the biggest contributor to the budget deficit is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the Bush-era tax cuts, particularly those for high earners, did contribute to the budget deficit, they were not the sole or even the primary cause. Other factors, such as increased military spending, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the economic downturn following the 2008 financial crisis, also played significant roles in the growth of the budget deficit during the Bush administration. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
195,"Explanation: The claim that a child's body will be injected with a disease for immunizations is false. Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a virus or bacteria, not the disease itself. The purpose of vaccines is to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the disease, thereby providing immunity without causing the disease. The claim of a 71 times injection is not supported by scientific evidence or medical practices.

200,"Explanation: The claim that 94 percent of carbon emissions are caused by nature is false.

Answer: 0"
201,"Explanation: Sen. Barbara Boxer was a prominent figure in the U.S. Senate and was known for her stance on immigration reform. However, the claim that she voted against immigration reform to permit Hispanic immigrants to come here legally to work is misleading. Sen. Boxer was a strong advocate for comprehensive immigration reform and supported measures to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. She voted in favor of the DREAM Act and other immigration reform bills. Therefore, the claim that she voted against immigration reform to prevent Hispanic immigrants from coming here legally is false.

Answer: 0"
202,"Explanation: The claim that the only growth sector in America in the last two years has been government growth is misleading.

Answer: 0"
203,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the plan or the costs it aims to reduce. It also does not specify who ""many observers"" are or what their credentials are. Additionally, the claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor has noted this. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
204,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, as of 2021, 38 states have appointed, rather than elected, state school superintendents.

206,"Explanation: The claim that each U.S. military working dog saves the lives of between 150 and 200 servicemen and women over the span of his career is not supported by reliable sources. While military working dogs are highly trained and contribute significantly to the safety and security of military operations, the specific number of lives saved by each dog is not a widely reported or verifiable statistic. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the dogs' contributions.

Answer: 0"
207,"Explanation: The claim about tourism in Ohio can be verified by checking reliable sources such as the Ohio Department of Commerce or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the Ohio Department of Commerce, tourism in Ohio supports over 439,000 jobs and generates over $36 billion in annual spending. These figures are consistent with the claim made.

Answer: 1"
208,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the growth in food stamp usage did not keep pace with the increase in unemployment. This statement is generally true. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in unemployment, but the growth in food stamp usage, while substantial, did not match the rate of increase in unemployment. This discrepancy can be attributed to various factors, including the timing of stimulus payments and the implementation of unemployment benefits.

Answer: 1"
209,"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days after the shootings of Dallas policemen. This claim is false because it is not supported by any credible sources or official records. The Dallas Police Department did not report such a high number of applications in such a short period following the shootings.

Answer: 0"
210,"Explanation: The claim is based on the gender wage gap, which is a well-documented phenomenon. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2020, women in Oregon earned 83.4% of what men earned, which is approximately 79 cents for every dollar paid to men. The claim then uses this figure to calculate the potential benefits if the wage gap were eliminated. The calculations are based on the average cost of gas, food, and rent in Oregon, which are reasonable assumptions. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"

213,"Explanation: House Bill 2 (HB2), also known as the ""Bathroom Bill,"" was a controversial law passed in North Carolina in 2016. It required individuals to use public restrooms that corresponded to their birth sex, rather than their gender identity. This law was widely criticized for discriminating against transgender individuals and was later repealed in 2017. The claim that ""We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina with the passage of HB2"" is false because HB2 did indeed take away certain rights, specifically the right of transgender individuals to use restrooms that align with their gender identity.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
217,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders have identical positions on healthcare is false. While all three candidates have proposed healthcare reforms, their plans differ significantly. Hillary Clinton's plan, for instance, was to expand the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), while Bernie Sanders proposed a Medicare for All system. Donald Trump's plan involved repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. None of these plans put the government in charge of both the patient and the doctor, as the claim suggests.

They moved to Atlanta in 1966 and have been known as the Atlanta Braves since then.

Answer: 1"
219,"Explanation: The claim that there are 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day is not accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, as of 2021, there are approximately 20 million veterans in the United States. However, the number of veterans who are homeless or on the street at any given time is significantly lower. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that around 40,000 veterans are homeless on any given night. Therefore, the claim that there are 200,000 to 400,000 veterans on the street is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
220,"Explanation: The claim is false. The New York Times article on Donald Trump's tax returns did not wait until paragraph 18 to point out that there was no wrongdoing. The article's headline and the first few paragraphs clearly stated that the documents showed no evidence of tax fraud or illegal activities. The claim misrepresents the content and structure of the article.

Answer: 0"

Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
222,"Explanation: The claim that Mexico does not have birthright citizenship and that Americans are the only ones to have it is false. Mexico does have birthright citizenship, which means that anyone born in Mexico is automatically a Mexican citizen. The United States is one of the few countries that grants citizenship to anyone born within its borders, regardless of the parents' immigration status, but this is not the only country with such a policy. Other countries, including Mexico, also have similar provisions.

Answer: 0"
223,"Explanation: The claim that Richmond is the most vegan-friendly city is not accurate. While Richmond does have a growing vegan scene with numerous vegan restaurants and shops, it is not the most vegan-friendly city in the United States.

228,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no official announcement or evidence that the president has released all of the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR is a stockpile of oil maintained by the U.S. government to ensure energy security and stabilize prices in case of emergencies. The release of oil from the SPR is typically done in response to specific events, such as natural disasters or market disruptions, and is not a routine or ongoing process.

Answer: 0"
229,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama administration did not intend to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations.

Answer: 0"
230,"Explanation: The claim that labor union president Andy Stern is the most frequent visitor at the White House is false.

While it is true that some extremist groups have used Trump's rhetoric and policies to recruit new members, it is not accurate to say that he is being used as a ""recruiting tool"" in the same way that a specific organization or individual might be. The claim is vague and lacks specific evidence to support it.

232,"Explanation: The claim ""On a cap-and-trade plan"" is incomplete and lacks context. A cap-and-trade plan is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, where a limit (cap) is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted, and companies can trade emission allowances. Without additional information about the specific context or details of the claim, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
233,"Explanation: Lyndon B. Johnson's stance on civil rights was complex and evolved over time. While it is true that he initially opposed many civil rights measures during his early years in Congress, he later became a strong advocate for civil rights legislation. In 1957, he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, but by the time he became President in 1963, he had shifted his position and played a crucial role in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Therefore, the claim that he opposed every civil rights measure that came up for a vote during his first 20 years in Congress is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
234,"Explanation: The claim that the Keystone XL pipeline would employ 20,000 people in the United States is an overestimation. While the pipeline's construction would create jobs, the actual number of jobs created is significantly lower. According to various studies and reports, the Keystone XL pipeline would create around 4,000 to 6,000 jobs during construction, with a smaller number of permanent jobs after completion. Therefore, the claim that it would employ 20,000 people is false.

Answer: 0"
235,"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, cyclists are required to follow the same traffic rules as motor vehicles. This means that cyclists must yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, and they must not block the crosswalk. Dipping a wheel into the road does not give cyclists any special legal rights to stop traffic. Cyclists must use hand signals and follow traffic signals just like any other vehicle.

Answer: 0"
236,"Explanation: Joe Garcia is a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the 23rd congressional district of Texas. He served from 2013 to 2019. Utility rates are typically regulated by state or local governments, not individual members of Congress. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Joe Garcia raised utility rates on families.

Answer: 0"
237,"Explanation: The claim that the lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less on healthcare is not accurate. According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks 38th in life expectancy at birth, while many countries with lower healthcare spending, such as Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland, rank much higher. Additionally, the U.S. spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but this does not translate to a longer lifespan. The claim oversimplifies the complex relationship between healthcare spending and life expectancy.

Answer: 0"
238,"Explanation: The claim is true. There have been instances where Republican lawmakers who voted against the stimulus package have later attended events and claimed credit for projects funded by the stimulus. This is a common political tactic where lawmakers may try to take credit for projects that were initiated or funded by their political opponents.

Answer: 1"
239,"Explanation: Rick Perry, the former Governor of Texas, did not provide in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. In fact, Texas has a law that prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition benefits. This claim is false.

Answer: 0"
240,"Explanation: The claim that a proposed immigration bill will bankrupt Georgia if passed is a generalization and lacks specific evidence or data to support it. The impact of immigration policies on a state's economy is complex and depends on various factors such as the type of immigrants, their skills, and the specific provisions of the bill. Without specific details about the bill and its potential economic impacts, it is not possible to accurately assess the claim.

Answer: 0"
241,"Explanation: The claim that a large majority of Republicans believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim and not U.S.-born is false. While there have been some conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns suggesting that Obama is not a U.S.-born citizen or is a Muslim, these claims are not supported by evidence and are widely rejected by fact-checking organizations. Polls and surveys have shown that a significant portion of Republicans do not believe these claims, and the majority of Republicans do not hold these views.

Answer: 0"
242,"Explanation: The claim that the Washington D.C.-area never has a recession is false. While the D.C. area has experienced economic growth and stability, it has not been immune to economic downturns. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the D.C. area experienced job losses and economic slowdown, similar to other regions in the United States. Therefore, the claim that the D.C.-area never has a recession is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
243,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Congressman Jeff Denham helped broker a deal to turn a taxpayer-owned building into an $800-a-night hotel.

Answer: 0"
245,"Explanation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2010, was designed to address the causes of the 2008 financial crisis. While it has had significant impacts on the banking industry, including increased regulatory requirements and capital requirements, it is not accurate to say that it is ""destroying"" community banks. Many community banks have adapted to the new regulations and continue to operate, although some have faced challenges. The claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
246,"Explanation: The claim that an entry-level janitor in New York City gets paid twice as much as an entry-level teacher is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for a janitor in New York City was $35,000 in 2020, while the median annual wage for a kindergarten teacher was $55,000. Therefore, the janitor earns less than half of what an entry-level teacher earns.

Answer: 0"
247,"Explanation: The claim that there is no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections is false. There is a significant body of research and historical data that shows a correlation between primary turnout and the success of candidates in the general election. Higher primary turnout often indicates a more engaged and mobilized electorate, which can translate to better performance in the general election. Therefore, the claim is not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
248,"Explanation: The claim that Africa is spending the highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world is not accurate. According to the World Bank, in 2019, the average expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP in Africa was around 4.4%, which is lower than the global average of 4.8%. Countries like South Korea and the United States spend a higher percentage of their GDP on education.

Answer: 0"
249,"Explanation: The claim that any academic benefits of government-funded preschool disappear by the fourth grade is not supported by recent studies. Research has shown that the benefits of preschool education can last well beyond the fourth grade. For instance, a study published in the journal ""Science"" in 2019 found that children who attended high-quality preschool programs had better academic outcomes and were more likely to graduate from high school and attend college. Another study by the Brookings Institution in 2018 also found that the benefits of preschool education can persist into adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
250,"Explanation: The claim is based on a common misconception about income tax distribution. While it is true that the top 1 percent of income earners often pay a significant portion of income taxes, the statement that those at the bottom pay little or nothing is an oversimplification. Many low-income individuals do not pay income taxes because they have little or no taxable income, but they do pay other taxes such as sales taxes, property taxes, and payroll taxes. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
251,"Explanation: The claim that a particular state has more children's hospitals than any other state in the union is not verifiable without specific data. The number of children's hospitals can vary based on population, healthcare needs, and other factors. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say that one state has more children's hospitals than any other without concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
252,"Explanation: The claim that many workers in Malaysia are indentured servants because their passports are taken away and they work in slave-like conditions is a misrepresentation of the situation. While it is true that some workers in Malaysia, particularly those from countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Indonesia, may face exploitation and have their passports held by their employers, this does not constitute indentured servitude. Indentured servitude is a legal term that refers to a contract of labor for a fixed period, often with the promise of freedom upon completion. In Malaysia, while there are issues of exploitation and abuse, the legal status of workers is not that of indentured servants. The claim also oversimplifies the complex issues of labor migration and exploitation.

Answer: 0"
253,"Explanation: The claim that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor was called a racist is false. While there have been criticisms and controversies surrounding her statements and rulings, the specific claim that she was called a racist by a particular individual or group is not accurate. The misconception might arise from her comments about the ""wise Latina"" and her views on judicial philosophy, but these comments were not made in the context of being called a racist.

Answer: 0"
254,"Explanation: The claim that ""ninety six percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses"" is not accurate. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, in New Hampshire (the Granite State), approximately 98% of businesses are considered small businesses. This means that the claim is exaggerated and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
255,"Explanation: The claim is false. The tax deduction for charitable donations is the same for everyone, regardless of their income level. The amount of tax deduction is based on the amount donated, not the donor's income. Therefore, both a middle-class family and Bill Gates would receive the same tax deduction for a $1 donation.

257,"Explanation: Mitchell International Airport is not the third busiest airport in the world. The third busiest airport in the world is Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the United States. Mitchell International Airport is not even the busiest airport in the country; that title belongs to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
258,"Explanation: Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, has indeed expressed support for Arizona's immigration law, SB 1070, which requires law enforcement to check the immigration status of individuals they suspect are in the country illegally. However, he has also stated that he believes the law should be implemented in a way that is consistent with the Constitution and that it should not be used to target individuals based on their race or ethnicity. Therefore, while he has supported the law as a model, he has also expressed concerns about its implementation and potential misuse.

Answer: 1"
259,"Explanation: The claim that individuals with mental illnesses die an average of 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness is true. This is supported by numerous studies and reports, including a 2014 study published in the journal ""Lancet Psychiatry"" which found that people with mental health conditions die on average 10-20 years earlier than those without. This is often due to a combination of factors including higher rates of physical health conditions, substance abuse, and suicide.

Answer: 1"
260,"Explanation: The claim that the government, not the armed forces, is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use is false. The U.S. government does not stockpile ammunition for domestic use. The U.S. military, not the government, is responsible for stockpiling ammunition for its own use. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the military's stockpiling activities.

Answer: 0"
261,"Explanation: The claim that ""Six of Georgia's counties have no lawyers at all"" is false. According to the American Bar Association, as of 2021, there are 159 counties in Georgia, and it is highly unlikely that six of them have no lawyers. While some counties may have a shortage of lawyers, it is not accurate to say that six counties have none at all.

Answer: 0"
262,"Explanation: The claim suggests that removing football (soccer) would lead to an increase in crime. This claim is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies on the relationship between sports and crime have shown mixed results, but there is no consistent evidence to suggest that removing football would directly cause an increase in crime. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or studies to support its assertion.

Answer: 0"
263,"Explanation: The claim that the five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are back on the battlefield is false. The five detainees, who were released in exchange for Bergdahl, have not been reported to have returned to the battlefield. The U.S. government has stated that they are not believed to be involved in any ongoing terrorist activities. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the situation and lacks credible evidence.

Answer: 0"
265,"Explanation: Prince William Sound in Alaska has experienced significant environmental impacts due to human activities, including oil spills, logging, and mining. While there are efforts to restore and protect the area, it is not accurate to describe it as ""pristine"" due to these ongoing issues. Therefore, the claim that Prince William Sound is pristine now is false.

Answer: 0"
266,"Explanation: The claim is about the language used in bills that the speaker has supported. It is a subjective statement and cannot be objectively verified without specific details about the bills and the language they contain.

Answer: 0/1"
267,"Explanation: According to the College Board's 2021 SAT report, Georgia ranks 39th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in SAT scores. Additionally, Georgia's graduation rate for the class of 2020 was 83.5%, which is below the national average of 86.1%. Therefore, the claim that Georgia is near the bottom among states for SAT scores and graduation rates is true.

Answer: 1"
268,"Explanation: The claim that the United States government has increased its employment base by 176,000 people in the last four years is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total employment in the federal government has been relatively stable over the past four years. In fact, the federal government's employment has decreased slightly from 2.7 million in 2017 to 2.6 million in 2021. Therefore, the claim that the government has increased its employment base by 176,000 people is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
269,"Explanation: The claim states that a person has never voted for a federal restriction on gun ownership. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting records of the person in question. Without specific information about the person's voting history, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
270,"Explanation: The claim that 12,808 people were arrested for marijuana-related crimes in Oregon in 2012 is false. According to the Oregon State Police, the number of marijuana-related arrests in 2012 was significantly lower. The actual number of marijuana-related arrests in Oregon in 2012 was around 1,000.

Answer: 0"
271,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual's legal actions and political stances. To verify the claim, we need to check if the person in question has indeed sued gun manufacturers and if they were supportive of Brady and assault weapon bans. Without specific names or additional context, it's challenging to confirm the claim's accuracy. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a well-known public figure, such as a politician or activist, we can look up their history to verify the claim.

272,"Explanation: The claim is false. U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, D-Macon, has not sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China. This claim is a misinterpretation or fabrication of his actual activities and policies.

Answer: 0"
273,"Explanation: The claim that the wealth gap between blacks and whites in the United States is greater than the black-white wealth gap in apartheid South Africa is false. While the wealth gap in the United States is significant, it is not greater than the wealth gap in apartheid South Africa. In apartheid South Africa, the wealth gap was extreme due to the systematic and legalized discrimination against the black population. In contrast, while the United States has a significant wealth gap, it is not as extreme as the gap in apartheid South Africa.

Answer: 0"
274,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, redistricting commissions are typically established by state legislatures or through ballot initiatives. The members of these commissions are usually appointed or elected, and they are subject to various ethical standards and laws. If a member of a redistricting commission were to accept a bribe, they would be subject to legal consequences, including removal from the commission. The claim that a member could not be removed is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
275,"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme is false. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading. Social Security, on the other hand, is a government-run program that collects taxes from workers and uses those funds to pay benefits to retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased workers. The funds are not used to pay off earlier investors, but rather to provide benefits to current and future retirees based on a pay-as-you-go system. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of a Ponzi scheme.

Answer: 0"
276,"Explanation: The claim that the vast majority of Syrian refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work is a generalization that does not accurately reflect the diversity of the Syrian refugee population. According to various studies and reports from organizations like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Syrian refugee population is diverse and includes people of all ages, genders, and abilities. While it is true that some refugees are young men seeking work, the majority of refugees are women, children, elderly, and those with disabilities. The claim also overlooks the fact that many refugees are fleeing conflict and seeking safety, not necessarily work.

Answer: 0"
277,"Explanation: The claim that ""Our men and women of the Guard have been forced to contact food banks to feed themselves"" is false. This statement is not supported by any credible sources or official statements from the Guard. It is important to verify information from reliable sources before making such claims.

Answer: 0"
278,"Explanation: Scott Walker, a former governor of Wisconsin and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, has been known for his strong stance against abortion. He has supported restrictions on abortion, including a 20-week ban and a requirement for women to view an ultrasound before having an abortion. While his views are indeed restrictive, it is difficult to definitively say that his views are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times. Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush also had strong anti-abortion stances, and some of their policies were similarly restrictive. Therefore, the claim that Walker's views are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
279,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, known as the ""Ryan Budget"" or ""Ryan Plan,"" was a part of the 2012 Republican budget proposal. It did not allow insurance companies to deny coverage or drop people for pre-existing conditions. Instead, it aimed to reduce the federal deficit by making changes to Medicare and other programs. The proposal was criticized for potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries and was not enacted into law.

Answer: 0"
280,"Explanation: The claim states that of the four statewide races this century within a 300-vote margin, three have been overturned in a recount. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that three out of four such races have been overturned. In fact, only one of the four races within a 300-vote margin in this century has been overturned in a recount. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not true.

Answer: 0"
281,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, the vaccination rate in Texas has not reached 95%. The actual vaccination rate in Texas has been fluctuating but has not exceeded 80% as of the latest data available. Therefore, the claim that the vaccination rate was 95% when the person left office is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
282,"Explanation: The claim that Central Health is the only hospital district in Texas that spends taxpayer dollars on abortions is false. While Central Health does provide abortion services, it is not the only hospital district in Texas that does so. Other hospital districts in Texas, such as Harris Health System and Parkland Health and Hospital System, also provide abortion services. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
283,"Explanation: The claim about restoring voting rights to non-violent felons is a complex issue that varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, for example, some states have laws that automatically restore voting rights to non-violent felons upon completion of their sentences, while others do not. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context and location.

Answer: 0/1"
284,"Explanation: The claim suggests that stories about a person's birth certificate drowned out media coverage of the Republican and White House budget plans. However, there is no specific evidence or context provided to support this claim. Without concrete information or sources, it is not possible to verify the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
285,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of positions eliminated by Chesterfield County's general government operations to the number of positions eliminated by the entire state government of Virginia since 2009. To verify this claim, one would need to obtain specific data on the number of positions eliminated in both entities over the specified period. Without such data, it is impossible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it requires specific data to be verified.)"
286,"Explanation: The claim that the Koch network is spending more money in a Senate race in Ohio than anywhere else in the country is not accurate. While the Koch network has been active in various political races across the country, including in Ohio, there is no evidence to suggest that they are spending more money in Ohio than in any other state. The Koch network's spending is often targeted at specific races and issues, but it is not accurate to say that they are spending more in Ohio than anywhere else.

Answer: 0"
287,"Explanation: The claim that the government does not need a warrant to read your old emails is false. In most jurisdictions, including the United States, the government generally needs a warrant or other legal authorization to access private communications, including old emails. This is governed by laws such as the Fourth Amendment in the U.S., which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, there are exceptions and specific circumstances where such access might be permitted without a warrant, but these are typically limited and require a high standard of evidence.

Answer: 0"
288,"Explanation: The claim that ""The poorest in this country are women"" is a generalization and can be misleading. While it is true that women often face unique challenges such as the gender wage gap and higher rates of poverty due to factors like caregiving responsibilities and lack of access to education and economic opportunities, it is not accurate to say that all women are the poorest in the country. Poverty is a complex issue influenced by various factors including race, ethnicity, age, and geographical location. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
289,"Explanation: The claim is false. Dow Chemical's decision to build a plant in Saudi Arabia rather than Oklahoma is primarily driven by economic factors, such as access to natural gas and other resources, rather than environmental regulations. The company's official statements and reports indicate that the decision was based on strategic business considerations, including market demand and resource availability.

Answer: 0"
291,"Explanation: The claim that Newark was paying 80 percent of its school budget from local property taxes is not accurate. According to the Newark Public Schools' budget reports, the percentage of the budget funded by local property taxes is typically around 30-40%, not 80%. The majority of the budget is funded by state and federal sources.

Answer: 0"
292,"Explanation: The claim that ""In every state, women are paid less than men"" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that, on average, women earn less than men in many states, there are exceptions. For instance, in some states, women may earn more than men on average. Additionally, the wage gap can vary significantly depending on the specific occupation, industry, and other factors. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
293,"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has indeed proposed various immigration reform plans that include legalizing certain groups of undocumented immigrants. However, the specific claim that he has said we should make the 11 million illegal workers legal is not a direct quote from him. He has advocated for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but the exact number of 11 million is not part of his specific proposals.

Answer: 0"
294,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama 'only wants your children to have health insurance'"" is a misrepresentation of President Obama's policies. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did expand health insurance coverage for children, it also aimed to provide health insurance for adults and improve the overall healthcare system. The claim simplifies and misrepresents the broader goals and impacts of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
295,"Explanation: Josh Mandel, a former Ohio state treasurer and current U.S. Senate candidate, has publicly opposed federal loans to the auto industry. He has argued that such loans are not necessary and that the industry should be allowed to stand on its own merits. This opposition is well-documented in various news articles and political statements.

Answer: 1"
296,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal law known as the ""Gun Control Act of 1968"" prohibits individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes from possessing firearms. This law applies to gun shows and other retail sales of firearms. While there may be some loopholes or inconsistencies in the enforcement of these laws, the claim that convicted abusers can simply walk into a gun show and purchase a gun without any questions asked is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
297,"Explanation: The claim about the high-speed rail project creating 60,000-plus jobs for Floridians is based on a study conducted by the Florida Department of Transportation. The study estimated that the project would create approximately 60,000 jobs during the construction phase. This claim is supported by official sources and is therefore likely to be true.

Answer: 1"
298,"Explanation: The claim that ""Today almost half our debt is owned by foreigners"" is not accurate. According to the latest data from the U.S. Treasury Department, as of the end of 2021, foreign investors held about 30% of the U.S. public debt. This percentage has been fluctuating over time but has not reached the ""almost half"" threshold.

Answer: 0"
299,"Explanation: The claim states that a specific Republican was the only one to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. To verify this claim, I would need to check the voting records of the House of Representatives for the specific vote in question. However, without specific details about the vote and the member's name, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
300,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has a track record of not raising taxes"" is vague and does not provide specific details or evidence. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need more context, such as the name of the person making the claim, the specific time period, and the political or economic context. Without this information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
301,"Explanation: The claim ""Were No. 1 in child hunger"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. It is not clear what ""Were No. 1"" refers to (e.g., a country, a year, a specific metric). Without additional information, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Therefore, it cannot be accurately judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
302,"Explanation: Glenn Hegar, the Texas Lieutenant Governor, has been a vocal advocate for reducing public school funding. He has supported legislation that has led to cuts in public school funding. Therefore, it is plausible that he expressed pride in these cuts.

Answer: 1"
303,"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas is false. The U.S. government has long maintained a policy of not providing direct aid to Hamas due to its designation as a terrorist organization. The U.S. has provided humanitarian aid to Gaza through other channels, but this has been done through international organizations and not directly to Hamas. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of U.S. foreign policy.

Answer: 0"
304,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is making voting more difficult by closing Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices where low-income voters live is a misrepresentation of the facts. The DMV office closures are part of a broader effort to consolidate and streamline government services, not specifically targeted at low-income voters. Additionally, the closures do not directly impact voting, as voters can still register and vote at other DMV offices or through other methods such as absentee voting or early voting.

Answer: 0"
305,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the alternative to higher state worker pension and health care payments is to lay off 1,500 state employees or remove 200,000 children from Medicaid-related programs. This claim is false because it presents a false dichotomy. The alternative to higher state worker pension and health care payments is not necessarily to lay off employees or remove children from Medicaid. There are other options such as reducing other state expenditures, increasing taxes, or finding other sources of revenue. The claim also does not provide any evidence or context to support the numbers given (1,500 layoffs and 200,000 children).

Answer: 0"
306,"Explanation: The claim that we actually don't have that many public employees and are well below average in the number of public employees is false. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United States has one of the highest levels of public employment among developed countries. As of 2021, the U.S. had approximately 2.1 million federal employees, which is a significant number compared to other countries. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has a low number of public employees is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
307,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Walton family, through their holding company Walton Enterprises, does indeed have significant wealth, but it is not accurate to say that they own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America. According to Forbes, the Walton family's wealth is estimated to be around $200 billion, while the bottom 40 percent of Americans have a combined wealth of around $1.5 trillion. Therefore, the claim that the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America is an exaggeration.

309,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) regularly publishes reports on programs at high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. The GAO's High-Risk List for Fiscal Year 2021, for example, includes programs such as the Department of Defense's acquisition programs, the Department of Health and Human Services' Medicare program, and the Internal Revenue Service's tax administration program. These programs are not targeted for elimination or severe cutback in House Republican spending plans, but they are listed as high-risk programs by the GAO.

Answer: 0"
310,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton has said she is going to ""wipe out the Second Amendment"" is false. Hillary Clinton has never made such a statement. She has consistently supported gun control measures, but her proposals have not included the elimination of the Second Amendment. Additionally, the claim that she does not believe in the First Amendment is also false. Hillary Clinton has publicly supported freedom of speech and the First Amendment. The claim that she believes in big government and that this flies in the face of the 10th Amendment is also misleading. Hillary Clinton has supported some government programs and regulations, but she has also advocated for states' rights and has not proposed a complete disregard for the 10th Amendment.

Answer: 0"
312,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia's illegal immigration crackdown laws should be called the ""Brown Codes"" due to their similarity to the Black Codes is a misinterpretation of historical context and a misuse of terminology. The Black Codes were a set of laws passed in the Southern United States after the Civil War to control and subjugate the newly freed slaves. The term ""Brown Codes"" is not a recognized historical term and does not have a specific meaning in the context of immigration laws. The comparison between the two sets of laws is not accurate or appropriate.

Answer: 0"

315,"Explanation: Texas does not have a state-level equal pay law, but it is not accurate to say that it is one of only a handful of states without such a law. Many states do not have their own equal pay laws, and the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963 is the primary legislation addressing equal pay. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

Answer: 0"
316,"Explanation: The claim that ""by 2009, dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield by drones"" is true. The use of drones for targeted strikes against senior terrorist leaders, including Osama bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and other high-value targets, was a significant part of U.S. counter-terrorism strategy in the late 2000s. By 2009, several high-profile terrorist leaders had been eliminated through drone strikes.

Answer: 1"
317,"Explanation: The claim is false. Tommy Thompson, a former Secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush, has been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has publicly stated his opposition to it. He has also been critical of the mandate and has advocated for its repeal. There is no evidence to support the claim that he favors the mandate or was thanked by Obama for health reform support.

Answer: 0"
318,"Explanation: The claim that faculty salaries at UW System institutions have now fallen more than 18 percent below the national average is not supported by reliable data or sources.

Answer: 0"
319,"Explanation: The claim that the Democratic Party created a debate schedule to maximize the opportunity for voters to see their candidates is true. The Democratic Party has indeed been proactive in scheduling debates to ensure that their candidates have ample opportunities to reach voters and discuss their platforms. This is a common strategy used by political parties to increase visibility and engagement with the electorate.

Answer: 1"
320,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal government's share of the gross domestic product (GDP) has been increasing over time, not decreasing. In 2020, the federal government's share of GDP was around 24.9%, which is higher than the 20% mentioned in the claim. The claim also incorrectly states that the private sector has lost 5% of its share, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
321,"Explanation: The claim that Governor Rick Scott is spending a quarter of a million of our tax dollars to robocall people is false. There is no evidence or credible source supporting this claim. Robocalls are typically used by political campaigns or other organizations to reach a large number of people quickly, but they are not funded by tax dollars. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a false statement.

Answer: 0"
322,"Explanation: The claim that South Florida has experienced nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s is not accurate. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the global sea level has risen by about 8 inches (20 cm) since the 1920s. While sea-level rise can vary regionally, the claim of nine inches specifically for South Florida is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
323,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney has a corporation in Bermuda and failed to disclose it on seven different financial disclosures is false. Mitt Romney has indeed disclosed his financial interests, including those in Bermuda, in his financial disclosure forms. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the information provided in his financial disclosures.

Answer: 0"
324,"Explanation: Washing hands and covering your mouth when you cough are indeed effective measures to reduce the transmission of the flu. These practices help prevent the spread of viruses by removing germs from your hands and preventing the spread of respiratory droplets.

Answer: 1"
325,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the president of the United States visited a ward that had a high percentage of votes for him in the last election, but the vote count did not increase. This claim is not verifiable with the information provided and lacks specific details about the ward, the president's visit, and the vote count. Without concrete evidence or a source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
326,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, public employees have the right to choose whether or not to join a union, but this is not a new policy. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 already provides this right. The claim suggests that this is a new policy, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
327,"Explanation: The claim states that a proposal to boost the teacher pension fund puts no mandate on local government. This claim is false because the proposal to boost the teacher pension fund would likely involve some form of mandate or requirement for local governments to contribute to the fund. The specifics of the mandate would depend on the details of the proposal, but the general idea is that local governments would be required to contribute to the fund to ensure its sustainability and to meet the needs of retired teachers.

Answer: 0"
328,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not help a man accused of raping a 12-year-old, nor was she seen laughing at the girl who was raped.

Answer: 0"
329,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker said no to equal pay for equal work for women is false. Gov. Scott Walker, who served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, did not publicly oppose equal pay for equal work for women. In fact, he signed a bill into law in 2014 that prohibited employers from asking job applicants about their salary history, which is a common practice that can perpetuate wage gaps.

Answer: 0"
330,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and appeared wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. Hillary Clinton did not spend 30 days in the hospital in 2012, and she has not been reported to have a traumatic brain injury. The claim is likely a misinterpretation of her health issues and the use of glasses for other reasons.

Answer: 0"
331,"Explanation: The claim about Portland having 84 public relations representatives on payroll costing taxpayers over $6.2 million annually is not accurate. According to the City of Portland's official budget documents, the number of public relations staff and their associated costs are not as high as claimed. The actual number of PR staff and their salaries are significantly lower than the figures stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
332,"Explanation: The claim that Saddam Hussein had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida is false. While there were some contacts between Saddam Hussein's regime and al-Qaida, particularly in the 1990s, these were not long-term or strategic alliances. The relationship was more opportunistic and tactical, with both parties seeking to use each other for their own purposes. The claim of a 10-year relationship is an exaggeration and not supported by historical evidence.

Answer: 0"
333,"Explanation: The claim that ""every 85 visitors create one Florida job"" is a generalization that does not provide specific context or data to support it. The relationship between tourism and job creation can vary greatly depending on factors such as the type of tourism, the local economy, and the specific businesses involved. Without specific data or studies to back up this claim, it is not accurate to say that every 85 visitors create one job.

Answer: 0"
334,"Explanation: The claim that heroin primarily comes from Mexico and over the border is true. Mexico is a significant source of heroin, with much of it being produced in the Golden Triangle region and smuggled across the border into the United States. This is a well-documented issue in the context of drug trafficking and border control.

Answer: 1"
335,"Explanation: The claim states that Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times and to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas just once. However, there is no specific information provided to verify the exact number of times Ted Cruz has visited these locations.

Answer: 0"
336,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the New Jersey Office of the Governor, the number of state employees has indeed decreased since 2001. In 2001, there were approximately 53,000 state employees, while in 2021, there were around 48,000. This reduction was achieved through attrition, not layoffs, as stated in the claim.

Answer: 1"
337,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Lower Manhattan (Manhattan Community District 1) in 2010 was approximately 100,000 people. By 2020, the population had increased to around 120,000 people, which is a 20% increase, not a doubling. In contrast, the combined population of Atlanta, Dallas, and Philadelphia in 2020 was approximately 5.5 million people, which is significantly higher than the population of Lower Manhattan.

Answer: 0"
338,"Explanation: The claim that the American slave trade caused 5 million deaths or more is an exaggeration. While the transatlantic slave trade was a brutal and deadly enterprise, the number of deaths is estimated to be around 1.8 million, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database. This figure includes deaths during the Middle Passage, as well as those who died in the Americas due to harsh conditions and diseases. Therefore, the claim that the American slave trade caused 5 million deaths or more is false.

Answer: 0"
339,"Explanation: The claim that the Saints will go undefeated and win the Super Bowl is a prediction about future events. Predictions about sports outcomes are inherently uncertain and cannot be definitively judged as true or false until the events occur. Therefore, this claim cannot be evaluated as true or false based on current information.

Answer: N/A"
340,"Explanation: The claim that a particular General Assembly is one of the most expensive, per capita, in the entire country is difficult to verify without specific data. The cost of a General Assembly can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, size, and the services provided. Without concrete figures or a specific context, it is impossible to determine the veracity of this claim.

Answer: 0"
341,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of job losses in Florida due to the stimulus program is not accurately represented by the figure of 211,000.

342,"Explanation: The claim that the city of Providence had the lowest crime rate in 30 years during the time the speaker was mayor is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to compare crime rates during the speaker's tenure with historical data from the past 30 years. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
343,"Explanation: The claim that 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of Obamacare is false. Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was designed to expand access to health insurance, not reduce it. The ACA has actually increased the number of people with health insurance in Kansas and across the country. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsured rate in Kansas decreased from 14.9% in 2013 to 7.5% in 2019, which is a significant reduction in the number of uninsured individuals. Therefore, the claim that 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance due to Obamacare is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
344,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United Nations (U.N.) does not have the authority to create or enforce gun laws within the United States. The U.S. government would need to ratify any U.N. treaty on conventional arms, but this would not automatically subject U.S. citizens to those gun laws. The U.S. Constitution and federal laws would still govern gun ownership and use within the country.

Answer: 0"
345,"Explanation: The claim that ""most of our new jobs have been part-time jobs since Obamacare became law"" is not accurate. While it is true that the number of part-time jobs has increased since the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was implemented, this is not the primary reason for the increase in part-time jobs. The increase in part-time jobs is more likely due to economic factors such as the Great Recession, changes in the job market, and the preferences of employers and employees. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that ""most"" new jobs have been part-time.

Answer: 0"
346,"Explanation: The claim that ""We have killed lots of innocent people in the state of Texas"" is a broad and vague statement that lacks specific context or evidence. It is not possible to accurately assess the truth of this claim without more detailed information about who is making the claim, the time period, and the specific incidents being referred to. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
347,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits health insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to individuals based on pre-existing conditions, including domestic violence. This is part of the ACA's essential health benefits and nondiscrimination provisions. While there may be some exceptions or nuances in specific cases, the general rule is that health insurance companies cannot deny coverage based on a history of domestic violence.

350,"Explanation: Dan Seals, a former Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2018, was born in 1959. The iPod was introduced in 2001, which means Dan Seals was already an adult when the iPod was released. Therefore, the claim that he has been running for office since before there were iPods is false.

Answer: 0"
351,"Explanation: The claim that the Miami Dolphins are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes is false.

Answer: 0"
352,"Explanation: U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison served in the Senate from 1993 to 2013. During her tenure, she voted on the debt ceiling multiple times.

353,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also known as Medicare Part D, was signed into law by President George W. Bush.

Answer: 1"
354,"Explanation: According to a 2021 report by Child Care Aware of America, the average annual cost of child care in the United States is $10,750 for a child in a center-based program. Meanwhile, the average cost of tuition for a four-year public college in the 2020-2021 academic year was $10,560. However, costs can vary significantly by state. For example, in California, the average annual cost of child care is $14,000, which exceeds the average cost of tuition in the state. Therefore, the claim that child care costs in some states now exceed the average price tag for college tuition is true.

Answer: 1"
355,"Explanation: The claim states that 85% of the funds collected in each county will be redistributed elsewhere, not spent in the county in which it is collected. This claim is false because it is not based on any specific policy or law. The redistribution of funds is typically determined by the government or the organization collecting the funds, and the percentage redistributed can vary greatly depending on the context and the specific policy in place.

Answer: 0"
356,"Explanation: The claim that the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay in the U.S. is 475 to 1 is based on a study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) in 2018. The study found that the average CEO pay was 312 times the average worker pay. However, the claim states a ratio of 475 to 1, which is not accurate based on the EPI's findings.

Answer: 0"
357,"Explanation: The claim that more than 100,000 women in Texas have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone is not supported by credible sources. The Texas Department of Health and Human Services does not provide specific data on self-induced abortions, and the claim is not backed by any reputable news outlets or studies. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of data on abortion access and methods.

Answer: 0"
358,"Explanation: The claim that the platform of the Republican Party says ""deport everybody and to hell with it"" is a misrepresentation of the party's actual stance. The Republican Party's official platform does not contain such language. The party's platform focuses on issues such as immigration reform, border security, and the enforcement of immigration laws, but it does not advocate for the mass deportation of all immigrants. The phrase ""deport everybody and to hell with it"" is not found in the party's official documents.

Answer: 0"
359,"Explanation: The claim that 14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote is false. Noncitizens, by definition, are not eligible to vote in most countries, including the United States. Therefore, it is not possible for 14 percent of noncitizens to be registered to vote.

Answer: 0"
360,"Explanation: The claim that ""thirty-four percent of Hispanics don't have any health care at all, don't have any health insurance"" is based on a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2019. The study found that 34% of uninsured adults in the United States are Hispanic. However, this does not mean that 34% of all Hispanics are uninsured, as the study does not provide data on the total Hispanic population. Therefore, the claim is false as it generalizes the data to all Hispanics.

Answer: 0"
361,"Explanation: Chris Abele is a prominent figure in Milwaukee politics, having served as the Milwaukee County Executive from 2011 to 2018. However, he is not a billionaire.

Answer: 0"
362,"Explanation: The claim that state employees will have to pay 100 percent of their pensions and health insurance after 2012 is false. This is because the specific details of pension and health insurance contributions for state employees are typically outlined in collective bargaining agreements or state laws, and such a significant change would require legislative action or collective bargaining negotiations. There is no evidence to support that such a change occurred after 2012.

Answer: 0"
363,"Explanation: The claim that members of Congress did not have three days to read the bill when the stimulus was rushed into law is false. The CARES Act, which was the stimulus bill passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, was indeed rushed through Congress. However, the claim that members of Congress did not have three days to read the bill is inaccurate. The bill was introduced on March 16, 2020, and passed on March 27, 2020, which is a period of about 11 days, not three days. Additionally, members of Congress had access to the bill's text and were able to review it before voting.

365,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. government predicted in 1916 that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down is false. There is no historical evidence to support this claim. The U.S. government did not make such a prediction, and the use of hemp for paper production was not widespread or predicted to replace traditional paper production by the 1940s.

The claim that they are not even citizens of the country is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
368,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare was patterned after Mitt Romney's plan in Massachusetts is true. Romney's health care reform in Massachusetts, known as the ""Romneycare"" plan, was implemented in 2006 and served as a model for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) signed into law by President Obama in 2010. Both plans aimed to expand health insurance coverage, although they differed in some aspects.

370,"Explanation: The claim that the Paul Ryan budget proposal would leave the country without Medicare is false. The Ryan budget proposal, which was introduced in 2013, did propose changes to Medicare, including raising the eligibility age and changing the program's financing structure. However, it did not propose eliminating Medicare entirely. The proposal aimed to reform the program to ensure its long-term sustainability, not to eliminate it.

Answer: 0"
371,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has one of America's toughest ethics laws is not accurate. While Georgia does have a strong ethics law, it is not considered one of the toughest in the country. For instance, states like California and New York have more stringent ethics laws, particularly in terms of campaign finance and lobbying regulations. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
372,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other sources. The statement that the wealthiest 25 percent pay 86 percent of total income taxes and the wealthiest 5 percent pay 60 percent of total income taxes is not accurate. The correct figures are as follows:
- The top 25 percent of income earners pay about 68 percent of total income taxes.
- The top 5 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of total income taxes.

These figures are based on data from the IRS and other reputable sources, such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Tax Foundation.

Answer: 0"
373,"Explanation: The claim that infant mortality within the three miles surrounding the University Circle area exceeds some Third World countries is false. Infant mortality rates are typically higher in developing countries due to factors such as lack of access to healthcare, poor nutrition, and inadequate sanitation. University Circle, located in Cleveland, Ohio, is a well-developed area with access to healthcare services, and its infant mortality rate is not significantly higher than that of many developed countries. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the infant mortality rate in the United States is around 5.6 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is lower than many Third World countries.

Answer: 0"
374,"Explanation: The claim that human activity is not causing dramatic changes to our climate is false. The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary drivers of the observed warming of the Earth's climate. This is supported by extensive scientific evidence, including the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, changes in global temperature patterns, and the melting of glaciers and polar ice.

Answer: 0"
375,"Explanation: The claim suggests a similarity between a 1995 plot to blow up 12 jumbo jets over the Pacific Ocean and the alleged plan of Lubbock terror suspects to use baby dolls to conceal chemical explosives. However, there is no evidence or credible source that supports this claim. The 1995 plot, known as Operation Bojinka, was a complex and sophisticated plan involving multiple individuals and was not related to the use of baby dolls. The Lubbock incident, involving the use of baby dolls, is a separate event and does not have any known connection to the 1995 plot.

Answer: 0"
376,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama has an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon is false. While the EPA under President Obama did propose regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, these regulations did not directly raise the price of gasoline. The Clean Power Plan, for example, aimed to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, but it did not target gasoline prices. The claim is a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the EPA's actions.

Answer: 0"
377,"Explanation: The Texas Constitution was amended in 1966 to repeal the poll tax and to grant women the right to vote. Therefore, the claim that the Texas Constitution still contains Jim Crow provisions about the poll tax and restrictions on women having the right to vote is false.

380,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not give every American the same opportunity to buy health insurance as members of Congress. Members of Congress have access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a different system from the ACA. The ACA provides subsidies to help low- and middle-income individuals and families purchase health insurance, but it does not give everyone the same opportunity as Congress members.

382,"Explanation: The claim is false. Under the federal law in the United States, if a federally licensed gun dealer's license is revoked due to misconduct, the dealer's inventory is not automatically deemed their personal collection. The dealer must first surrender the inventory to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The ATF will then dispose of the inventory, typically through a process that includes background checks. The dealer cannot sell the inventory free from any background checks.

Answer: 0"
383,"Explanation: The claim is about the 2004 U.S. Presidential election in New York. In that election, George W. Bush won 40 counties in New York, while John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, won 58 counties. This information is accurate and can be verified through various sources, including the official results from the New York State Board of Elections.

Answer: 1"
384,"Explanation: The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) do not specify a minimum percentage of instructional time that must be spent on informational texts. The standards do emphasize the importance of informational texts and require that students read a variety of texts, including informational texts, but they do not mandate a specific proportion of time to be spent on them. Therefore, the claim that Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time on informational texts is false.

Answer: 0"
385,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statement about the state employees pension plan. To verify its truthfulness, one would need to consult reliable sources such as official government reports, financial audits, or reputable news outlets that have covered this topic.

Answer: 0/1"
386,"Explanation: The claim that Margaret Thatcher told George H.W. Bush not to ""go wobbly"" is indeed an old wives' tale. The phrase ""Don't go wobbly"" is often attributed to Thatcher, but there is no verified evidence to support that she actually said this to Bush. The story is more of a myth or urban legend rather than a factual event.

Answer: 0"
387,"Explanation: The claim that oil companies ""haven't touched"" 68 million acres where they already have rights to drill is misleading. While it is true that some oil companies may not have drilled on all the acres they have rights to, the statement implies that these acres are untouched, which is not accurate. Oil companies often conduct exploration activities, such as seismic surveys, on these acres, even if they haven't yet drilled for oil. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
388,"Explanation: The claim that Phoenix, Arizona, is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City, is false. According to the FBI's 2019 Crime in the United States report, Phoenix had 1,027 kidnapping incidents, while Mexico City had 1,200. However, the FBI's data does not rank cities by the number of kidnappings, and the claim is not supported by any reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
389,"Explanation: The claim is false. During the main GOP presidential debate in 2016, several candidates had military experience. For example, John Kasich served in the U.S. Army Reserve, and Ben Carson served in the U.S. Air Force. Therefore, the claim that ""Not one candidate on the debate stage has military experience"" is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
392,"Explanation: The claim ""I didn't raise taxes once"" is a statement made by a politician or public figure. To evaluate its truthfulness, one would need to examine the historical record of tax policies implemented during their tenure. Without specific context or data, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. However, if the claim is made by a politician, it is common for them to make such statements, and it would require independent verification to confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
393,"Explanation: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States rations care like systems in Canada and Great Britain is misleading. The ACA does not ration care in the same way that these countries' healthcare systems do. In Canada and Great Britain, healthcare is provided through a single-payer system, which means the government funds and manages the healthcare system. In contrast, the ACA is a complex law that expands access to health insurance through private and public options, but it does not ration care in the same way as single-payer systems. The ACA does have provisions to control costs and manage healthcare spending, but it does not limit access to care based on need or ability to pay in the same way as single-payer systems.

Answer: 0"
394,"Explanation: The claim that Sandra Day O'Connor had no judicial experience before joining the Supreme Court is false. Before her appointment to the Supreme Court, O'Connor served as a judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals for two years. Therefore, she did have judicial experience before joining the Supreme Court.

395,"Explanation: The claim that ""half of the primary care doctors in Massachusetts are not accepting new patients"" is not accurate. While there may be some primary care doctors who are not accepting new patients due to various reasons such as retirement, burnout, or changes in practice, it is not accurate to say that half of them are not accepting new patients. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual situation.

Answer: 0"
396,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific ordinance in San Antonio that allows men into women's restrooms. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of existing policies or proposed changes.

Answer: 0"
397,"Explanation: John Cornyn, a U.S. Senator from Texas, did not endorse David Dewhurst for the U.S. Senate over Ted Cruz. In fact, Cornyn himself ran for the Senate in 2012 and was defeated by Cruz. Therefore, the claim that Cornyn backed Dewhurst is false.

Answer: 0"
398,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker, the former governor of Wisconsin, banned employees from talking about climate change is false. While Walker was known for his stance against environmental regulations and climate change policies, there is no evidence to support the claim that he implemented a policy banning employees from discussing climate change. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of his policies.

Answer: 0"
399,"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was not a state senator and therefore did not have the authority to support or refuse measures in that capacity. Additionally, there is no record of him refusing to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship.

Answer: 0"
400,"Explanation: The claim that we could cut unemployment in half simply by reclaiming the jobs taken by illegal workers is a simplification of a complex issue. While it is true that reducing the number of illegal workers could potentially create more jobs for legal workers, it is not accurate to say that this would cut unemployment in half. The relationship between illegal immigration and unemployment is complex and influenced by many factors, including the overall economy, job market demand, and the specific industries affected. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential economic impact of removing illegal workers, such as the loss of productivity and the need for new workers to fill the vacancies.

Answer: 0"
401,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median income in the United States has been increasing since the start of the recovery from the Great Recession. In 2010, the median income was $50,056, and by 2019, it had risen to $67,521. Therefore, the median income is not below what it was at the start of the recovery.

Answer: 1"
403,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare has led to a rise in part-time employment is a complex issue that has been debated among economists and policymakers. While some studies suggest that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, may have contributed to an increase in part-time work, particularly among low-wage workers, it is not accurate to say that this is the primary or sole reason for the trend. Other factors, such as technological changes, economic conditions, and business strategies, also play significant roles in the shift towards part-time employment. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate and should be considered false.

Answer: 0"
404,"Explanation: The claim that Langevin votes the party line about 98 percent of the time is a generalization and lacks specific context or evidence.

The budget allocation is publicly available and has been reported by various news outlets.

Answer: 0"
406,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Geneva Conventions are a set of international laws that establish standards for humanitarian treatment in war. They do not prohibit the targeting of terrorists or their families. The Geneva Conventions do, however, require that combatants be treated humanely and that civilians be protected from harm. The claim seems to misinterpret or misrepresent the purpose and provisions of the Geneva Conventions.

Answer: 0"
408,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Census Bureau does not release figures that directly attribute population changes to tax burdens. The Census Bureau provides data on population changes, but it does not attribute those changes to specific factors like tax burdens. Therefore, the claim that the states tax burden has cost the state another 190,000 residents in 2009 is not supported by any official census figures.

Answer: 0"
409,"Explanation: The claim that new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of new business applications has been increasing in recent years.

Answer: 0"
411,"Explanation: The claim that the top 20 percent of income earners pay nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes is generally accurate. According to data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other sources, the top 20 percent of income earners in the United States do indeed pay a significant portion of federal taxes. For example, in 2019, the top 20 percent of income earners paid approximately 69.5 percent of all federal income taxes.

Answer: 1"
412,"Explanation: The claim is based on a report from the Center for Responsive Politics, which is a reputable source for political spending data. The report states that in the 2020 election cycle, super PACs raised $1.6 billion, with about half of that coming from fewer than 200 donors and about 20 percent from corporations. The claim is a simplified version of this data, but it accurately reflects the overall trend. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
413,"Explanation: The claim that ISIS is currently crucifying Christians in Iraq is false. While ISIS has been known to commit atrocities against various religious and ethnic groups, including Christians, there is no credible evidence to support the specific claim of crucifixions. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of ISIS's actions, which have included beheadings, mass executions, and forced conversions, but not crucifixions.

415,"Explanation: The claim that the fastest-rising expense in the U.S. Defense Department is health care is not accurate. While health care costs have been increasing, the fastest-rising expense in the U.S. Defense Department is actually personnel costs. This includes salaries, benefits, and other related expenses. The increase in personnel costs is primarily due to the growing number of military personnel and the rising costs of benefits and retirement programs.

Answer: 0"
416,"Explanation: The claim that Texas is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country is an exaggeration. While Texas has been experiencing significant population growth, it is not accurate to say it is growing twice as fast as the rest of the country. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Texas's population growth rate has been high, but it is not double the national average. For instance, in 2020, Texas's population growth rate was around 1.4%, while the national average was around 0.4%.

Answer: 0"
417,"Explanation: The claim about the importance of an independent voting record is a subjective statement that can vary based on individual perspectives and political ideologies. However, it is generally accepted that an independent voting record can indicate a politician's ability to make decisions based on their own judgment rather than party lines. This can be seen as important for several reasons, such as promoting bipartisanship, encouraging compromise, and ensuring that legislation is based on the best interests of constituents rather than party politics.

Answer: 1"
418,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a 50-50 public-private split for paying for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena would be better than most other arena projects around the country. However, this claim is subjective and depends on the specific context and criteria used to define ""better."" Without specific data or comparisons with other arena projects, it is difficult to definitively say whether a 50-50 split is indeed better. The claim does not provide enough evidence or context to support its assertion.

Answer: 0"
419,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of pain clinics and McDonald's in Broward County. As of my last update, there are approximately 100 McDonald's locations in Broward County. The number of pain clinics can vary, but it is generally lower than the number of fast-food restaurants. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there are more McDonald's locations than pain clinics in Broward County.

Answer: 0"
420,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible information or evidence to suggest that former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney have outstanding warrants that prevent them from visiting Europe. Both individuals have been active in public life and have traveled internationally without any reported issues related to legal warrants.

Answer: 0"
421,"Explanation: The claim about the stimulus bill containing $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers and $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs is false. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which is the stimulus bill in question, does not include provisions for these specific purposes. The bill primarily focuses on economic relief, healthcare, education, and infrastructure, but not on fish passage barriers or ATV trail rehabilitation.

Answer: 0"
422,"Explanation: John McCain, a Republican Senator, voted against the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. He was a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility and opposed the tax cuts, which he believed would increase the deficit. However, in 2017, he voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was a significant tax reform bill. Therefore, the claim that he voted against the Bush tax cuts and is now for them is true.

Answer: 1"
423,"Explanation: The claim that ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil is not accurate. While it is true that ISIS has controlled some oil fields in Libya and has sold oil to generate revenue, the extent of their control and the amount of money they generate is often exaggerated. The United Nations and other international organizations have reported that ISIS's oil revenues are significantly lower than the claimed millions of dollars per week. Additionally, the oil sales are often conducted through informal and illegal channels, making it difficult to accurately quantify their earnings.

Answer: 0"
424,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the percentage of the federal government's spending in the U.S. economy over time. In 2020, the federal government spent approximately 24.9% of the U.S. GDP, which is indeed higher than the 2% spent in 1920. However, the claim states ""25 percent"" which is slightly higher than the actual figure. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
425,"Explanation: The claim is about the number of times a specific governor, Jay Nixon, has been overridden compared to all previous governors in Missouri history. To verify this claim, we would need to know the exact number of times Nixon has been overridden and compare it to the historical data of all previous governors. Without specific data, it is impossible to confirm the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0"
426,"Explanation: Rick Scott's former healthcare company, Columbia/HCA, was indeed involved in a significant fraud scandal. In 1997, the company pleaded guilty to 14 criminal charges, including fraud, conspiracy, and kickbacks. The company was ordered to pay $340 million in fines and penalties. This incident is well-documented and widely reported in the media.

Answer: 1"
427,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama attempted to filibuster Justice Alito is false. President Obama did not attempt to filibuster Justice Alito. Justice Alito was nominated by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 2006, long before President Obama's term began. President Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017.

Answer: 0"
428,"Explanation: The claim is based on a poll conducted by the NRA itself, which is known to have a bias towards its own members' views. While it's possible that a significant portion of NRA members support background checks, the claim is not verifiable from independent sources. The NRA's poll results are not widely accepted as definitive evidence of the views of all NRA members.

Answer: 0"
429,"Explanation: The claim that tens of billions of dollars from taxpayer-funded bailouts flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks is misleading and not entirely accurate. While it is true that AIG received significant bailout funds from the U.S. government, the funds were used to stabilize the company and prevent a collapse that could have had severe economic consequences. A portion of these funds was used to pay off debts and obligations, including those to foreign entities. However, the claim suggests a direct and intentional flow of funds to foreign entities, which is not supported by the facts. The bailout funds were intended to stabilize AIG and the broader financial system, not to enrich foreign corporations or banks.

Answer: 0"
430,"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a famous quote by Daniel Webster, ""I am out, and I am in."" This quote is often used to describe a situation where someone has changed their mind or position. The claim is a play on this quote, suggesting that someone has changed their mind about something. However, without additional context, it's impossible to determine the specific situation or person being referred to. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
431,"Explanation: The claim is made by a platform, and it states that it will not make any changes to the current Medicare system for current retirees and those approaching retirement. This claim is a statement of intent and does not provide any specific details or evidence to support it. Without additional context or verification, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
432,"Explanation: The claim is false. The information provided is not accurate. Volvo's decision to locate its new plant in South Carolina, rather than Georgia, was announced in early May 2022. However, the number of jobs and the investment amount mentioned in the claim are not supported by any official sources or announcements from Volvo or the South Carolina government. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual news.

Answer: 0"
433,"Explanation: Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) was indeed called a socialist and a communist by his political opponents during his time in office. These labels were used to criticize his New Deal policies, which included significant government intervention in the economy. However, FDR himself did not identify as a socialist or a communist. He was a Democrat and his policies were more accurately described as liberal or progressive.

Answer: 1"
434,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""90 percent of that [deficit increase] is as a consequence of President George W. Bush's policies and the recession"" is not accurate. While the recession did contribute to the increase in the deficit, it is not accurate to attribute 90% of the increase to President George W. Bush's policies. The deficit increased significantly during the Bush administration, but this was also due to factors such as the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the economic stimulus packages in response to the recession. The claim oversimplifies and misattributes the cause of the deficit increase.

Answer: 0"
435,"Explanation: The claim states that a particular state is the only one in the country that bypassed the General Assembly to authorize in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. This claim is false because there are multiple states that have authorized in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, and the process of authorization varies by state. Some states have done so through legislation, while others have done so through executive action or court decisions.

Answer: 0"
436,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported national poll that specifically states the majority of Americans believe we should have a gold standard for U.S. currency. While there may be polls on various economic topics, a gold standard is a niche issue that is not typically the focus of mainstream polls. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
437,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks is false. The Armed Pilots Program, also known as the Armed Guardians Program, was established by the Trump administration in 2019. It is a program that allows armed pilots to carry firearms on commercial flights to protect against potential threats. Barack Obama was not involved in the creation or funding of this program, as he was no longer in office when it was implemented. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that he is trying to slash funding for it.

Answer: 0"
438,"Explanation: The claim that the nuclear arsenal of a country is ineffective due to outdated equipment is a serious allegation that requires verification. However, the claim that the equipment is 30 years old and that its effectiveness is uncertain is not supported by credible sources. Nuclear weapons systems are typically subject to rigorous testing and maintenance protocols to ensure their reliability and effectiveness. Without specific, credible sources to back up this claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is false.

Answer: 0"
439,"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Cash for Clunkers"" program, which was a U.S. government initiative to encourage the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, did not involve the government seizing personal information or tracking computer activity. The program was administered through a website, but the government did not have the capability or authority to access personal information or monitor computer activity of individuals who used the website. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the program's purpose and capabilities.

Answer: 0"
440,"Explanation: The claim that the state Legislature passed more than $5 billion in tax increases in 2009 is false. According to the California State Legislature's official records, the total tax increases passed in 2009 were significantly less than $5 billion. The largest tax increase passed that year was the extension of the state's sales tax by 1/4 cent, which amounted to approximately $1.5 billion annually. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
441,"Explanation: The claim that ""Right now we are the highest taxed country in the world"" is false. The United States is not the highest taxed country in the world. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the highest taxed country in the world is France, with a total tax-to-GDP ratio of 45.4% in 2020. The United States has a total tax-to-GDP ratio of 24.9% in 2020.

Answer: 0"
442,"Explanation: The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was a U.S. government program created in response to the financial crisis of 2008. The program involved the government providing funds to financial institutions in exchange for preferred stock or other securities. The goal was to stabilize the financial system and prevent further collapse. The first round of repayments from financial institutions that received TARP money did not necessarily result in a profit for the government. The government's goal was to recoup the funds and stabilize the financial system, not to make a profit. Therefore, the claim that the government turned a profit in the first round of repayments is false.

Answer: 0"
443,"Explanation: The claim that Border Patrol signs near the Mexico border are in English, Spanish, and Chinese is false. Border Patrol signs are typically in English and Spanish, as these are the primary languages spoken by the populations in the areas where the border is located. Chinese is not a common language used on these signs.

Answer: 0"
444,"Explanation: The claim is false. Harry Reid, a former Democratic Senator from Nevada, has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. He has publicly stated that he does not support Trump and has criticized his policies and actions. Therefore, the claim that Reid likes Trump and can work with him is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
445,"Explanation: The claim states that there are 90,000 unemployed or underemployed residents in Multnomah County as a result of the 2008 Wall Street crash. However, this claim does not provide a source or specific data to support the number of 90,000. Without credible evidence or a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
446,"Explanation: The claim states that every governor at the midterm of their first term has lost seats in the Legislature, with the exception of Jim McGreevey in 2003. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that every governor has lost seats in the Legislature at the midterm of their first term. There are exceptions to this rule, and the claim incorrectly implies that Jim McGreevey is the only exception.

Answer: 0"
447,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific study or report from the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) regarding the impact of light rail in Cobb County on commute times and traffic congestion. However, without specific details or references to the study, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. Typically, such claims would need to be backed by empirical data and analysis from the GRTA or other reputable sources. If the claim is based on a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the study's findings, it would be false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional information.)"
448,"Explanation: The claim is false. The person has indeed stated that they are a single-payer supporter. This can be verified by checking their public statements or interviews where they explicitly mentioned their support for single-payer healthcare.

Answer: 0"
449,"Explanation: The claim that the state's rainy day fund has grown by 643 percent since Gov. Nathan Deal's office in 2011 is false. The rainy day fund is a fund that states use to save money during economic downturns. The growth of the fund is typically measured in terms of the fund's balance relative to the state's budget or other relevant metrics, not as a percentage increase. The claim of a 643 percent increase is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the fund's growth.

Answer: 0"
450,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama built this $16 trillion debt is false. The debt level of $16 trillion was reached during the Obama administration, but it is not accurate to say that he ""built"" this debt. The debt level increased due to a combination of factors, including the economic crisis of 2008, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and other policies implemented during his presidency. However, it is not accurate to attribute the entire debt to his actions.

Answer: 0"
451,"Explanation: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing tax laws in the United States. However, the IRS does not have any authority over healthcare. The healthcare system in the U.S. is primarily regulated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Therefore, the claim that the IRS is going to be in charge of our healthcare is false.

Answer: 0"
452,"Explanation: The claim is false. The phrase ""endowed by their Creator"" is not found in the original text of the Declaration of Independence. The phrase ""endowed by their Creator"" was added to the Declaration of Independence by the U.S. Congress in 1952, and it was not part of the original text written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776. Therefore, no president has deliberately removed these words, as they were not originally present in the document.

Answer: 0"
453,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's presidential victory was an electoral landslide is false. While Trump did win the presidency, the margin of victory was not a landslide. In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Trump won the electoral college vote by 304 to 227, but he did not win the popular vote. He received approximately 46.1% of the popular vote, while Hillary Clinton received approximately 48.2%. The difference in the popular vote was about 2.1 million votes, which is not considered a landslide.

Answer: 0"
454,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin's rainy day fund is 165 times bigger than when you first took office is not accurate. The rainy day fund, also known as the budget stabilization fund, is a fund that states use to manage fluctuations in revenue. The size of the fund can vary based on economic conditions and state policies. Without specific data or context, it's not possible to verify the claim that the fund has grown 165 times since a specific point in time.

Answer: 0"
455,"Explanation: The claim that Ted Cruz has not led businesses is false. Ted Cruz has been a businessman before entering politics. He co-founded a consulting firm called ""Cruz & Associates"" in 2003, which he led until 2007. He also worked as a lawyer and served as the Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2007. Therefore, he has led businesses and held professional positions before his political career.

Answer: 0"
456,"Explanation: Donald Trump has publicly stated that he supports the use of stop-and-frisk policies, which are used by law enforcement to temporarily detain and search individuals who are suspected of criminal activity. He has expressed his belief that these policies can help reduce crime rates. Therefore, the claim that Donald Trump thinks stop-and-frisk is fine is true.

Answer: 1"
457,"Explanation: The claim ""This is a test of the Share the Facts widget"" is a statement about the purpose of the text or content being shared. Since it is a self-identified test, it is not a claim about a factual event or statement that can be verified as true or false. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being a true or false claim.

Answer: 0"
458,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Joint Ways Means Committee is a fictional entity, and there is no record of a Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project bridge. The claim is likely a fabrication or a misinterpretation of actual events.

Answer: 0"
459,"Explanation: The claim is attempting to put the $1 trillion economic stimulus plan into perspective by comparing it to the amount of money that would have been spent if $1 million was spent every day since the birth of Jesus Christ. To evaluate this claim, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent over that period.

Assuming Jesus Christ was born in 4 BC, the number of years since then is approximately 2021 - 4 = 2017 years. If $1 million was spent every day for 2017 years, the total amount spent would be:

2017 years * 365 days/year * $1 million/day = $730,450,000,000

This is indeed less than $1 trillion, so the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
460,"Explanation: The claim is false. The individual in question, James Clapper, was indeed appointed by Eric Holder to investigate government leaks. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that he helped or donated to Obama's campaign or was involved in vetting vice presidential prospects. These are unfounded allegations.

Answer: 0"
461,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""As the Democrats finally maxed out their government spending credit card Monday"" is a metaphorical and hyperbolic way of saying that the Democrats have reached their limit on government spending. However, the claim that Kurt Schrader, a Democratic Congressman from Oregon, ""continued to stand with his party leaders in failing to offer any viable long-term solution"" is not accurate. Kurt Schrader has been vocal about his support for fiscal responsibility and has proposed various solutions to address the debt and deficit. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
462,"Explanation: The claim ""Could I just point out that ... I seem to get the first question all the time?"" is a subjective statement and does not provide any verifiable information. It is not possible to objectively determine the truth of this claim without additional context or evidence.

Answer: 0"
463,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal deficit for the fiscal year 2021 was approximately $2.8 trillion. The average salary of a professional baseball player in 2013 was around $4 million. To calculate the total salary for all players in 2013, we would need the number of players, which is approximately 800 (400 in the MLB and 400 in the minor leagues). So, the total salary for all players in 2013 would be around $3.2 billion. The claim suggests that the deficit could pay for these salaries for 248 years, which is not accurate. The deficit is not a fixed amount that can be used to pay for salaries over a long period. It is a measure of the government's annual spending exceeding its annual revenue.

Answer: 0"
464,"Explanation: The claim that Portland has won more national Constitution contests than any city in America is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no widely recognized or standardized national Constitution contest that Portland has won more times than any other city. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as true or false based on available information.

Answer: 0"
465,"Explanation: The claim is a political statement and does not provide specific evidence or examples of statements made by the administration. It is a general accusation that lacks concrete details, making it difficult to verify its truthfulness. Political rhetoric often involves generalizations and accusations that may not be supported by specific facts.

Answer: 0"
466,"Explanation: The claim states that there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation. To evaluate this claim, I would need to know the specific legislation being referred to. However, without specific details, I cannot definitively say whether this claim is true or false. If the legislation in question explicitly states that there will be no public funding for abortion, then the claim would be true. If the legislation allows for public funding or does not explicitly state that there will be no public funding, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0/1 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
467,"Explanation: Virginia does not have a major league sports team. The closest major league teams are the Washington Nationals (based in Washington, D.C.) and the Baltimore Orioles (based in Baltimore, Maryland). Therefore, the claim that Virginia is the biggest state without a major league sports team is true.

Answer: 1"
468,"Explanation: The claim that there is no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant and that higher CO2 concentrations actually help ecosystems is false. While it is true that CO2 is a natural part of the Earth's atmosphere and is essential for plant growth, the claim that it is not a pollutant is misleading. CO2 is considered a pollutant because it contributes to climate change, which has significant negative impacts on ecosystems, including increased temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent and severe weather events. Higher CO2 concentrations can indeed stimulate plant growth in the short term, but the long-term effects of increased CO2 levels on ecosystems are overwhelmingly negative.

Answer: 0"
469,"Explanation: The claim is false. Mike Martinez, a former city councilman in San Diego, was convicted of misconduct in office and fraud. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, not avoided jail time. The $24,657.50 figure is the amount he was ordered to pay in restitution, not a legal bill. The claim misrepresents the facts of the case.

Answer: 0"
470,"Explanation: The claim is about the number of private sector jobs added in New Jersey since January 2010. To verify this, I would need to check the official data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Without specific data, it's not possible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
471,"Explanation: The claim about Guantanamo detainees receiving taxpayer-paid-for prayer rugs and having honey-glazed chicken and rice pilaf is false. The U.S. military provides religious materials to detainees, including prayer rugs, but these are not paid for by taxpayers. The claim about the food is also false, as detainees are provided with standard military rations, not honey-glazed chicken and rice pilaf.

Answer: 0"
472,"Explanation: The claim that ""about 25 Texas cities and 39 states have banned texting while driving"" is false. While many states and cities have laws against texting while driving, the numbers provided are not accurate. As of my last update, Texas has a law against texting while driving, but it is not accurate to say that 25 Texas cities have banned it. Additionally, the number of states with such bans is more than 39, but the exact number can vary depending on the specific laws and their enforcement.

Answer: 0"
473,"Explanation: The claim states that Floridians have sent $3 billion less of their funding for the new state budget. However, without specific data or context, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be true or false depending on the source and the specific details of the budget.

Answer: 0/1"
474,"Explanation: The claim that the Bush tax cuts created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years they were in existence is a simplification of a complex economic issue. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) has conducted studies that suggest the Bush tax cuts did not create a significant number of jobs. Instead, they argue that the tax cuts primarily benefited the wealthy and did not stimulate job growth. Additionally, the claim that 5 million jobs were lost during the recession is accurate, but it does not directly relate to the impact of the Bush tax cuts. The recession was caused by a variety of factors, including the housing market collapse and the financial crisis.

Answer: 0"
475,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the swearing-in process for a Massachusetts official was delayed to allow for the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim. The ACA was passed in 2010, and the swearing-in process for Massachusetts officials would not have been directly affected by its passage. The claim appears to be a conspiracy theory without factual basis.

Answer: 0"
476,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Saudi Arabia is the only country in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) where women cannot get licenses to drive, there are other Muslim-majority countries where women also face restrictions on driving. For example, in Yemen, women are not allowed to drive in certain areas, and in some parts of Afghanistan, women are not allowed to drive at all. Therefore, the claim that Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim country where women cannot get licenses to drive is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
477,"Explanation: The claim that federal employees' benefits and wages far outstrip the market rates of the private sector is a complex issue that depends on various factors. While it is true that federal employees often receive certain benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and job security, these benefits are not always directly comparable to private sector wages. Additionally, federal employees' wages are often lower than those in the private sector for similar positions. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
478,"Explanation: The claim is based on a report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) which estimated that ending the direct payment farm subsidy program could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years. The CBO's report is a credible source, and the claim accurately reflects the findings of the report. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
479,"Explanation: The claim is false. Marco Rubio has not made such a statement. The quote is a misattribution to Marco Rubio, and it is actually a paraphrase of a statement made by Keith Olbermann. Marco Rubio has not advocated for people to leave the country if they do not agree with him.

Answer: 0"
480,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt is approximately $28 trillion, while the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is around $23 trillion. While the debt is significant, it does not yet exceed the size of the national economy.

Answer: 0"
481,"Explanation: The claim is true. Barack Obama, who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017, was known for his efforts to work across party lines. He was successful in passing several significant pieces of legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which was a bipartisan effort. Additionally, he worked on issues like the economic recovery after the 2008 financial crisis and the Iran nuclear deal, both of which involved bipartisan cooperation.

Answer: 1"
482,"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not suggest that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. In fact, Romney has been a strong advocate for women's health and has supported access to contraception. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his views.

Answer: 0"
483,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Republican Party platform has historically advocated for less regulation on campaign finance, including the repeal of the McCain-Feingold Act, which was a significant piece of campaign finance reform legislation. Conversely, the Democratic Party platform has consistently supported more stringent regulations on campaign finance to promote fairness and transparency.

Answer: 1"
484,"Explanation: The claim is made by a governor, suggesting that they took specific actions to control tuition increases. However, without specific details or evidence, it is difficult to verify the claim. Governors often make such claims to highlight their achievements, but without concrete data or sources, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
485,"Explanation: The claim that DeKalb County has cut more money from its general fund budget than any local government in the Atlanta metro region is difficult to verify without specific data and context. Budget cuts can vary greatly depending on the fiscal year, the specific programs or services being cut, and the overall economic conditions. Without concrete evidence or a comparison with other local governments in the Atlanta metro region, it is not possible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
486,"Explanation: The claim that Rubio's tax swap proposal ""would have been a massive tax increase"" is false. Rubio's proposal, which was part of his 2016 presidential campaign, aimed to reduce the corporate tax rate and offset the revenue loss by closing loopholes and eliminating certain tax credits. While some aspects of the proposal could have led to increased taxes for certain individuals or businesses, the overall goal was to simplify the tax code and reduce the overall tax burden. Therefore, the claim that it would have been a ""massive tax increase"" is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
487,"Explanation: The claim suggests that mayors have the power to block water treatment plants that are intended to treat cryptosporidium, even if a company like CH2M Hill wants to build them. This is a false claim because mayors do not have the authority to block such projects based on their personal beliefs or the desires of a company. The decision to build water treatment plants is typically made by local or state authorities based on public health needs and regulatory requirements.

Answer: 0"
488,"Explanation: The claim that Florida was No. 1 in violent crime in America in the mid-1990s is false. According to FBI crime statistics, in 1995, Florida ranked 10th in the nation for violent crime rates. The claim that citizens of Florida were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds is also incorrect. The actual rate of violent crimes per capita in Florida in 1995 was much lower than the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
489,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker's listening sessions are invite-only and excluding the press is false. Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, has held public listening sessions where he has invited the public to attend and participate. These sessions are open to the public and are not restricted to invite-only attendees. Therefore, the claim that the press is excluded is also false, as the press is typically allowed to attend and report on these events.

Answer: 0"
490,"Explanation: The claim that right-to-work states are creating more jobs than heavily unionized states is a complex issue that depends on various factors. Studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of right-to-work laws on job creation. Some studies suggest that right-to-work laws can lead to increased job growth, while others find no significant difference or even a negative impact. The job creation rate can also be influenced by other factors such as economic conditions, industry trends, and government policies. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that right-to-work states are consistently creating more jobs than heavily unionized states.

491,"Explanation: The claim that the leader of ISIS was imprisoned by American troops and ordered released to Iraq by the Obama administration in 2009 is false. The leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was not imprisoned by American troops. He was captured in 2014 and killed by American forces in 2019. The claim about his imprisonment and release in 2009 is a misinterpretation of events and is not supported by credible sources.

Answer: 0"
492,"Explanation: The claim is false. Del. Ben Chafin did not take money away from Southwest Virginia schools. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and voted on various bills, including those related to education funding. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he personally took money away from schools or voted to build a politician's palace. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of his actions.

Answer: 0"
493,"Explanation: The claim that spending of government money is 17 percent less than it was a decade ago is not accurate. Government spending can vary significantly from year to year due to various factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and emergencies. Without specific data or context, it is not possible to verify this claim. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
494,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin state budget proposal does not include a provision that would cause state employees' income to disappear overnight. The proposal, which is still under debate, includes changes to state employee benefits and compensation, but it does not involve a 20% reduction in income for employees earning $30,000, $40,000, or $50,000 a year.

Answer: 0"
495,"Explanation: North Korea is known to have a large standing army, but the claim that it has the largest per capita is not accurate. While North Korea has one of the largest armies in terms of total numbers, when considering the population, other countries like Israel and Singapore have larger armies per capita. Therefore, the claim that North Korea has the largest army per capita is false.

Answer: 0"
496,"Explanation: The claim that an Iranian woman risks being beaten or killed for showing too much hair in public is a misrepresentation of the reality in Iran. While there are strict dress codes and laws regarding public behavior in Iran, the claim is an exaggeration and not based on accurate information. The Iranian government enforces laws that require women to wear the hijab, but these laws do not extend to the extent of physical violence or death for showing hair. The claim is likely a result of misinformation or sensationalism.

Answer: 0"
497,"Explanation: The claim that Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown votes about 66 percent with his own party is a factual statement.

Answer: 1"
498,"Explanation: The claim states that ""He has ushered in $3 billion in new investment."" To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as official press releases, financial reports, or reputable news outlets. Without specific information about who ""he"" refers to and the context of the investment, it is impossible to confirm the claim's validity.

Answer: 0"
499,"Explanation: Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop"" by political opponents.

Answer: 1"
500,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has not publicly stated that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. While she has expressed support for certain gun control measures, such as universal background checks and closing loopholes in the current system, she has not advocated for the complete abolition of the Second Amendment. Therefore, the claim that she wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment is false.

Answer: 0"
501,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the salaries of top officials at the Port Authority with the salaries of governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them. The Port Authority is a bi-state agency that serves New York and New Jersey, and its top officials are not directly comparable to governors of these states. Governors are elected officials with salaries set by their respective state legislatures, while top officials at the Port Authority are appointed and their salaries are set by the Port Authority's board of directors. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them.

Answer: 0"
502,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. In the 1980s, the Democratic administration of President Jimmy Carter did propose spending cuts, but the subsequent administration of President Ronald Reagan implemented significant tax cuts. Therefore, the claim that Democrats delivered only tax hikes is not accurate, as they did not deliver any tax hikes during their time in office.

Answer: 0"
503,"Explanation: The claim that only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved is not accurate. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the clearance rate for murders in St. Louis has been fluctuating but has generally been above 50% in recent years. For instance, in 2019, the clearance rate was 60.5%, and in 2020, it was 59.3%. Therefore, the claim that only half of the murders are solved is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
504,"Explanation: The claim is false. The legislation in question is the USA PATRIOT Act, which Senator John McCain supported. This act does not provide the authority for the federal government to surveil American citizens without any suspicion of terrorist activity or criminal behavior. The act requires a certain level of suspicion or probable cause for surveillance. Additionally, the act includes provisions for judicial oversight and transparency.

Answer: 0"
505,"Explanation: The Baucus health care bill, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a comprehensive health care reform law that was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. The bill does not contain any provisions that could be used to ban guns in home self-defense. The claim is a misinterpretation or a false statement about the bill's contents.

Answer: 0"
506,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker received a $7,300 pay raise is false. According to the Wisconsin State Legislature's website, the governor's salary is set by law and does not change unless the legislature votes to increase it. As of my last update, Gov. Walker's salary was $159,000 per year, and there is no evidence of a $7,300 increase.

Answer: 0"
507,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, Tennessee does not have a state sales tax on groceries. However, there are local sales taxes that vary by county. Therefore, the claim that Tennessee's grocery tax is one of the highest in the nation is false.

Answer: 0"
508,"Explanation: The claim that 48% and 49% of President Barack Obama's supporters are people who pay no income tax is a misinterpretation of a statement made by Mitt Romney during the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Romney's statement was based on a report from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that showed 47% of Americans did not pay federal income taxes in 2011. However, this does not mean that 48% or 49% of Obama's supporters are non-taxpayers. The claim is false because it misrepresents the data and implies a direct correlation between political support and tax status that is not supported by the facts.

Answer: 0"
509,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not send a much larger force to deal with Ebola than ISIS. In fact, the U.S. response to Ebola in West Africa was primarily focused on medical and humanitarian efforts, rather than a military response. The U.S. military was involved in providing logistical support and medical care, but the number of troops deployed was not significantly larger than those involved in the fight against ISIS.

Answer: 0"
510,"Explanation: The claim is false. Harry Reid, the former U.S. Senate Majority Leader, did not make any public statements regarding whether Senate Democrats would seat Roland Burris. Burris was appointed to the Senate by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich after the resignation of Barack Obama, who was elected President of the United States. The appointment was controversial, and Burris was eventually seated by the Senate.

Answer: 0"
511,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States is not number one in the world in energy resources. Russia is indeed a major energy producer, but it is not number two in the world. The United States is the world's largest producer of natural gas and the second-largest producer of oil. However, when considering total energy resources, including coal, oil, and natural gas, Russia is the largest producer, followed by the United States.

Answer: 0"
512,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to the United States by 550 percent is false. Hillary Clinton did not propose such a policy during her 2016 presidential campaign. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a deliberate distortion of her stance on refugee policy. Clinton's proposed plan was to accept a higher number of refugees, but not to a degree that would increase the number by 550 percent.

Answer: 0"
513,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim ""We are at a 40-year low in our crime rate in our state,"" I would need to check the latest crime statistics for the state in question. Without specific data, it's impossible to verify the claim. However, if the claim is based on official statistics or reputable sources, it would be considered true.

Answer: 0/1 (I cannot determine the truth of the claim without specific data.)"
514,"Explanation: The claim about New Jersey's tenure law being reformed to state that teachers lose tenure after two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings is false. New Jersey's tenure law, as of my last update, does not include such a provision. Teachers in New Jersey typically lose tenure after three consecutive years of ineffective ratings, not two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings.

Answer: 0"
515,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by James Hansen, a prominent climate scientist. Hansen has indeed warned about the potential for significant sea-level rise due to climate change. However, the specific numbers mentioned in the claim (50 years, 10, 20, 30 feet of sea-level rise) are not accurate representations of Hansen's statements. Hansen has stated that sea levels could rise by several meters over the next century, but the exact figures and timeframes mentioned in the claim are not accurate.

Answer: 0"
516,"Explanation: The claim that more people are losing their insurance than are becoming newly insured due to Obamacare is not accurate. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to increase the number of people with health insurance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the uninsured rate in the United States has been declining since the implementation of the ACA. In 2010, the uninsured rate was 16.0%, and by 2019, it had dropped to 8.9%. This indicates that more people have gained insurance coverage than have lost it.

Answer: 0"
517,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the current numbers (which are not specified) to Ronald Reagan's numbers during his presidency. Without specific data points or context, it's impossible to verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is referring to polling numbers or approval ratings, it would be necessary to compare the current numbers to Reagan's approval ratings during his presidency with Jimmy Carter as the previous president. Without this specific data, the claim cannot be accurately evaluated.

Answer: 0"
518,"Explanation: The claim that the president referred to the Syrian opposition as ""pharmacists and doctors"" is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim. The president's statements about the Syrian opposition have been more focused on their role in the conflict and their political aspirations, but not in the context of their professions.

Answer: 0"
519,"Explanation: The claim that the racial and ethnic makeup of the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office mirrors the community it serves is not necessarily true. While it is important for law enforcement to reflect the diversity of the community they serve, the actual makeup of the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office may not perfectly mirror the community's demographics. This is due to various factors such as recruitment processes, hiring practices, and the overall diversity of the applicant pool.

Answer: 0"
520,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that state legislators and Congress have the authority to decriminalize marijuana, local governments, including cities, also have the power to implement their own policies regarding marijuana. Clarkston, like many other cities, can indeed decriminalize marijuana through local ordinances, even if the state or federal laws do not allow it.

Answer: 0"
521,"Explanation: The claim that a Democratic poll operation shows that Fox News is the most trusted news operation in the country is false. Polls conducted by Democratic organizations typically reflect the views of their supporters and may not be representative of the entire population. Additionally, there is no specific poll from a Democratic organization that supports this claim. Fox News is often criticized for its conservative bias, and polls from various sources often show that it is not the most trusted news operation among all Americans.

Answer: 0"
522,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rob Portman, a former U.S. Senator and current U.S. Trade Representative, has been involved in trade negotiations and policies, including those related to China. However, the claim that he ""failed, looked the other way, did nothing"" regarding China's illegal dumping of steel is not accurate. Portman has been actively involved in trade negotiations and has taken actions to address trade issues, including those related to steel dumping. The claim oversimplifies and misrepresents his role and actions.

Answer: 0"
523,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion rights over time. In 2012, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2020, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of fetal abnormalities. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop.""

Answer: 1"
524,"Explanation: The claim that Fox News said the New Black Panther Party decided the election for Barack Obama is false.

Answer: 0"
525,"Explanation: The claim is true. Barack Obama did accept donations from political action committees (PACs) and lobbyists during his presidential campaigns. He also used funds from his political action committee (PAC) to finance his campaigns. This information is well-documented and widely reported in various sources.

Answer: 1"
526,"Explanation: The claim that the world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070 is based on projections from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The FAO has estimated that global food demand will increase by about 50% by 2050, and this projection is widely accepted by experts in the field. However, the claim specifies ""double"" which is an exaggeration of the actual projection. Therefore, while the demand for food will increase significantly, it will not double.

Answer: 0"
527,"Explanation: The claim that every major study shows hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created by passing cap-and-trade legislation is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. While some studies have shown that cap-and-trade policies can create jobs in certain sectors, such as renewable energy, the overall impact on job creation is more nuanced and varies depending on the specific policies and economic conditions. Additionally, the claim that ""if you wind up pricing carbon"" is a bit ambiguous and could be interpreted differently depending on the context.

Answer: 0"
528,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the acceptance of gay marriage or civil unions in the country. However, it does not provide specific data or sources to support the claim. As of my last update in October 2023, the acceptance of gay marriage and civil unions varies by state and country, and a precise figure of 40% is not universally accepted or supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
529,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information indicating that the president of the United States is advocating for a drone strike program specifically in America. Drone strikes are typically used in overseas operations, and any domestic use would require significant legal and political justification. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
530,"Explanation: There have been several investigations and reports about Donald Trump's business dealings, including allegations of ties to organized crime figures. However, these allegations have not been substantiated with concrete evidence. The most notable case is the Trump Tower meeting in 2016, where Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with a Russian lawyer who was said to have information that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton. While this meeting was reported, it did not involve direct ties to the mafia or mob. Therefore, the claim that there have been multiple media reports about Donald Trump's business dealings with the mob or mafia is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
531,"Explanation: The claim about state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo) running a red light and seriously injuring a bicyclist is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific source or evidence to support this claim. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
532,"Explanation: The claim is about a political figure promising four more years of an administration that will push for the privatization of Social Security. This claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the administration or the politician in question. Without concrete evidence or a clear source, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
533,"Explanation: The claim that the Austin Independent School District's graduation rate reached an all-time high of 82.5 percent in 2012 is false. The Austin Independent School District's graduation rate for the 2011-2012 school year was 81.5 percent, not 82.5 percent. This information can be verified through the Texas Education Agency's website, which provides annual graduation rates for school districts in Texas.

Answer: 0"
534,"Explanation: The claim that Senate Republicans have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee in the last five years is false. While Republicans have used the filibuster more frequently in recent years, it is not accurate to say that they have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee. The filibuster is a procedural tool used to delay or prevent a vote on a bill or nomination, and it is not used on every piece of legislation or every nominee. Additionally, the filibuster can be invoked by any senator, not just Republicans.

Answer: 0"
535,"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Chris Christie's budget cuts did not lead to the closure of six of the state's 58 family planning centers. In fact, the closures were due to a lack of funding from the federal government, not state budget cuts. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual events.

Answer: 0"
536,"Explanation: The claim that former Sen. Tom Daschle said, ""Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them,"" is false. There is no evidence or record of Sen. Daschle making such a statement. This claim appears to be a misattribution or a fabrication.

Answer: 0"
537,"Explanation: The claim that the average Emergency Room (ER) wait in California is 5 hours due to the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is misleading. While the Affordable Care Act has had an impact on healthcare access and costs, it has not directly caused a significant increase in ER wait times. In fact, studies have shown that the Affordable Care Act has led to an increase in primary care visits, which can help reduce ER congestion. Additionally, the average ER wait time in California is typically around 2-3 hours, not 5 hours. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
538,"Explanation: The claim that it is rare for a retirement grade determination to be conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces is not accurate. Retirement grade determinations are typically conducted for all retired officers, regardless of their previous retirement status. This process is part of the standard procedure for reviewing and adjusting retirement benefits based on the officer's service record and performance.

Answer: 0"
539,"Explanation: Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican, has been known to vote more with the Democrats than with the Republicans. He has often been critical of his party's leadership and has voted with Democrats on several key issues. This is a well-documented fact and can be verified through various political analysis websites and news reports.

Answer: 1"
540,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Balanced Budget Amendment was never close to passing Congress. It was introduced in 1995 and 1997, but it never came within one vote of passing. Additionally, Rick Santorum did not call for a top Senate Republican to resign his chairmanship. Santorum was a senator from Pennsylvania and was not involved in the Balanced Budget Amendment process in the way described in the claim.

Answer: 0"
541,"Explanation: The claim that California's Capitol building is second only to Disneyland among visitor sites in the state is false. While the California State Capitol is a significant and popular tourist attraction, Disneyland is far more visited. According to data from the California State Capitol Museum, the Capitol receives around 1.5 million visitors per year, while Disneyland attracts over 18 million visitors annually. Therefore, Disneyland is the most visited site in California, not the California State Capitol.

Answer: 0"
542,"Explanation: The claim is based on projections and estimates, which can change over time. The interest payments on the national debt and defense spending are both subject to various factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and budgetary decisions. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the interest payments will be $722 billion and defense spending will be $696 billion by 2023 without specific and up-to-date sources.

544,"Explanation: The claim that you have offered a plan to fix Social Security that is supported by Robert Reich, who served as Secretary of Labor under the Clinton administration, is false. Robert Reich has publicly criticized the current Social Security system and proposed reforms, but there is no evidence that he has endorsed any specific plan proposed by you. Additionally, the claim does not provide any details or sources to support the assertion that Reich has endorsed your plan.

Answer: 0"
545,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs is a complex issue that requires a nuanced analysis. Walker's policies, such as the repeal of collective bargaining rights for public employees and the implementation of various business-friendly regulations, have been criticized for potentially leading to job losses. However, attributing a specific number of job losses to Walker's actions is challenging due to the multitude of factors that influence job markets, including economic trends, industry-specific issues, and broader national and global economic conditions. Therefore, the claim that Walker's actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs is not verifiable with the information provided.

Answer: 0"
546,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Federal Reserve in 2019, which found that 40% of Americans would struggle to cover a $400 emergency expense. The claim states 47%, which is an incorrect figure. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
547,"Explanation: The claim that House Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks is false. David Obey's partial earmark ban, which was implemented in 2007, aimed to reduce the influence of lawmakers in the appropriations process by limiting the use of earmarks. However, the ban did not apply to all earmarks, but it significantly reduced their number and influence. The claim that it wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks is an exaggeration and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
548,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that 95% of climate scientists agree that humans are the primary cause of global warming. Surveys of climate scientists, such as those conducted by John Cook and others, have consistently shown that the vast majority of climate scientists (over 97%) agree that humans are the primary cause of global warming. The claim that 57% of climate scientists do not agree with this idea is not supported by scientific consensus or surveys.

Answer: 0"

Without this context, it is impossible to determine the veracity of the claim.

Answer: 0"
551,"Explanation: Ken Buck, a Republican congressman from Colorado, has indeed expressed his opposition to abortion, including in cases of rape or incest. However, he has not explicitly stated that he wants to ""outlaw"" abortion in these specific cases. His stance is more about limiting access to abortion rather than completely banning it. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
552,"Explanation: The claim is about Mayor Kenney's stance on the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) and his position on city employees utilizing this benefit. The claim states that Mayor Kenney personally does not support DROP but acknowledges that highly qualified city employees can appropriately utilize the benefit. This claim is true because it accurately reflects Mayor Kenney's position on the matter. He has publicly stated that he does not support DROP but understands that some city employees may use it.

Answer: 1"
553,"Explanation: Scott Walker, who served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, did implement significant cuts to education funding during his tenure. However, the claim that these were the ""biggest cuts in our state's history"" is subjective and depends on the specific time frame and context. While Walker's cuts were substantial, it is difficult to definitively say they were the largest in Wisconsin's history without comparing them to other periods of significant cuts.

Answer: 0"
554,"Explanation: The claim is false. When George W. Bush took office in 2001, the annual budget was not in surplus. In fact, the budget deficit had been increasing under the Clinton administration, and it continued to grow under Bush's presidency. The last budget surplus occurred in 2000, the last year of the Clinton administration.

Answer: 0"
555,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about the property appraisers' budget, the time period, and the source of the information. Without concrete data or a reliable source, it is impossible to verify the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
556,"Explanation: The claim is based on a remark made by a speaker at an AFSCME forum in 2007. While it is true that there are jobs in fields like auto mechanics and airline mechanics that can be well-paying, the claim that 60% of kids are not going to college and that these jobs are unfilled is not supported by current data. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021, about 68% of high school graduates were enrolled in postsecondary education, and the unemployment rate for high school graduates was around 6.5%. Additionally, the claim that these jobs are unfilled is not accurate as there are often more job seekers than available positions in these fields.

Answer: 0"
557,"Explanation: The claim that ""I am every year the No.1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas"" is highly unlikely to be true. Law enforcement agencies typically have specific criteria and processes for hiring, and it is not common for an individual to be the top pick every year across all agencies. Additionally, there is no public record or widely recognized source that supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
558,"Explanation: The claim that ""We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States"" is false. While it is true that the United States has not had a widespread outbreak of Ebola, there have been cases of Ebola in the United States. For example, in 2014, two healthcare workers in Texas were infected with Ebola after treating a patient who had traveled from West Africa. Additionally, in 2015, a nurse in New Jersey was infected with Ebola after treating a patient who had traveled from West Africa. Therefore, the claim that there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
559,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the cost of two days of interest paid to China with the cost of one joint strike fighter (jet). The interest paid to China is a result of the U.S. government's borrowing from China, which is a complex financial transaction. The cost of a joint strike fighter is a significant military expenditure. The claim is comparing two unrelated financial concepts, making it difficult to directly equate them. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
560,"Explanation: The claim that our larger domestic threat is from racial supremacist groups is a complex issue that depends on various factors such as the definition of ""larger"" and the specific context of the threat. While it is true that racial supremacist groups pose a significant threat to public safety and societal harmony, it is also important to consider other domestic threats such as extremist groups, political violence, and cyber threats. Therefore, the claim is not universally true as it simplifies the issue and does not account for other potential threats.

Answer: 0"
561,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama won in states that did not require a photo ID to vote, such as California, Illinois, and New York. However, he also won in states that did require a photo ID, such as Florida and Virginia. The claim that he lost in every state that required a photo ID is incorrect.

562,"Explanation: The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is a U.S. government agency that provides financing to U.S. exporters. The bank's support for exports is a well-documented and established fact. Therefore, the claim that the Ex-Im Bank provides support for exports is true.

Answer: 1"
563,"Explanation: The claim that the person did not have an involvement with nutritional supplement company Mannatech is false. In 2016, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charged Mannatech with making false and misleading claims about its products. The company's founder, Samuel E. Lee, was also named in the lawsuit, which alleged that he had made false claims about the health benefits of Mannatech's products. The lawsuit was settled in 2017, with Mannatech agreeing to pay $22 million in damages and Lee agreeing to pay $10 million. Therefore, the claim that the person did not have an involvement with Mannatech is false.

Answer: 0"
564,"Explanation: The claim that ""We worked together to enact ... the largest tax cut in Florida history"" is vague and lacks specific details about the tax cut and the individuals involved. Without concrete information about the size of the tax cut, the specific legislation, and the individuals who were involved, it is impossible to verify the claim's accuracy. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
565,"Explanation: The claim that Bill Nelson voted in favor of higher taxes 272 times is false.

566,"Explanation: The claim states that the spending increase is less than 2 percent every year, which is the lowest increase since records have been kept. However, without specific data or context, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim. The statement could be true if it is based on official records or reliable sources, but it could also be false if it is an exaggeration or misinterpretation of data.

Answer: 0/1"
567,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not say that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. The negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, and Germany) were focused on Iran's nuclear program, but the approach was to reach a comprehensive agreement that would limit Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, not the dismantling of the sanctions in exchange for dismantling the nuclear program.

Answer: 0"
568,"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Rick Perry did not live in a rental mansion during his term. He continued to reside in the historic Governor's Mansion, which was undergoing repairs.

569,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of pages in the conforming bills has not increased from 400 to 2,200 between 2008 and 2011. The actual number of pages in the bills has remained relatively stable during this period.

Answer: 0"
570,"Explanation: The claim that public employees receive something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, the total number of public employees in Rhode Island was approximately 30,000, while the total number of private sector employees was around 350,000. This indicates that public employees make up a smaller percentage of the workforce in Rhode Island, not 25 percent.

Answer: 0"
571,"Explanation: The Iran Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was designed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The agreement included strict inspections and limitations on Iran's nuclear activities. While Iran has been accused of violating the deal in certain aspects, such as its ballistic missile program, the deal itself was intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the claim that the Iran Deal will facilitate and accelerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is false.

Answer: 0"

The claim is a misinterpretation of the hack's contents and is not supported by any credible evidence.

Answer: 0"
574,"Explanation: The claim that Bill McCollum ""served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants"" is false. Bill McCollum is a former U.S. Representative from Florida who served in Congress from 1995 to 2011. He has not been known to have served as a lobbyist, and there is no evidence to suggest that he or his clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants.

Answer: 0"
575,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Governor Scott Walker is intentionally fabricating job numbers to make Wisconsin's economic performance look better. However, this claim lacks specific evidence or sources to support the allegation that the numbers are ""just dreamed up."" Without concrete proof, it is not possible to verify the claim's accuracy. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
576,"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Scott Walker's administration did not reduce the state investment in kindergarten education. In fact, during his tenure, Wisconsin increased funding for early childhood education programs. The state's investment in kindergarten and other early education programs has been maintained and even increased in some areas. Therefore, the claim that a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in their education as those that came before them until they are graduating from high school is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
577,"Explanation: The claim that you can make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher in Georgia compared to other states is not accurate. Salaries for teachers can vary significantly based on factors such as experience, education, and the specific school district. While some states may offer higher salaries, Georgia's average teacher salary is not significantly higher than the national average. According to the National Education Association, the average salary for a public school teacher in Georgia in the 2020-2021 school year was around $58,000, which is slightly above the national average of $61,320. Therefore, the claim that you can make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher in Georgia is false.

Answer: 0"
578,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, there are seven tax brackets for the 2021 tax year, not ten. The top tax bracket for single filers in 2021 is for income over $523,600, not $9,000. Therefore, someone making $9,000 would be in the 10% tax bracket, not the top bracket.

Answer: 0"
579,"Explanation: The claim that American manufacturers are creating new jobs for the first time since 1990 is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the manufacturing sector has been adding jobs consistently since the 2010s. In fact, the manufacturing sector added 28,000 jobs in January 2023 alone. Therefore, the claim that this is the first time since 1990 is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
580,"Explanation: The claim is comparing household income changes over different periods and under different political figures. The statement about Mitt Romney's time as governor of Massachusetts is not directly comparable to the current national trend. The claim about the $4,000 decrease in household income over the last four years is a general statement and does not provide specific data or sources. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and lacks context to be considered true.

Answer: 0"
581,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has never voted for raising taxes"" is a statement about a person's voting record. To verify this claim, one would need to check the person's voting history, which is typically publicly available through government records or political databases. Without specific information about the person's voting history, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional information.)"
582,"Explanation: The claim that both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush support the Keystone XL pipeline is false. Bill Clinton has been critical of the pipeline, while George W. Bush did not explicitly support it during his presidency. The Keystone XL pipeline was a contentious issue during Barack Obama's presidency, and both Clinton and Bush have not publicly endorsed it.

Answer: 0"
583,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is indeed the law of the land. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010, and has been upheld by the Supreme Court. The claim that it is not the law of the land is false.

Answer: 0"
584,"Explanation: The claim that less than 10 percent of Obama's Cabinet appointees have any experience in the private sector is not accurate. According to a study by the Brookings Institution, about 40 percent of Obama's Cabinet appointees had private sector experience. This includes individuals who had worked in business, law, or other non-governmental sectors before joining the Cabinet.

Answer: 0"
585,"Explanation: John McCain's health care plan, which was proposed during his 2008 presidential campaign, did not include a specific guarantee for coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care. His plan focused more on expanding health insurance options and reducing costs, but it did not explicitly address these specific services. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
586,"Explanation: The claim that Dick Cheney supported gay marriage sooner than Hillary Clinton is false. Dick Cheney was a prominent opponent of same-sex marriage throughout his political career. He was a vocal critic of the legalization of same-sex marriage and supported the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has evolved on the issue of same-sex marriage. She initially opposed it but later became a strong supporter. Therefore, the claim that Cheney supported it sooner than Clinton is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
587,"Explanation: The claim that the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of metro Atlanta is bigger than 28 states in the union is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the GDP of metro Atlanta (which includes the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metropolitan statistical area) was approximately $370 billion in 2020. While this is a significant figure, it is not larger than the GDP of 28 states. For example, the GDP of California alone was over $2.7 trillion in 2020, which is much larger than the GDP of metro Atlanta.

Answer: 0"
588,"Explanation: Charlie Crist, who served as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011, did not oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006. In fact, he supported the Dream Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Therefore, the claim that he opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006 is false.

Answer: 0"
589,"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown voted to cut Medicare by over $500 billion in order to fund government-run health care is false. Sherrod Brown has consistently opposed cuts to Medicare and has voted against legislation that would reduce Medicare benefits. Additionally, the claim that he voted to fund government-run health care is misleading, as Brown has not supported a single-payer healthcare system.

Answer: 0"
590,"Explanation: The claim is about the cost of health coverage in Florida's program. The statement ""usually it's about $900 a month to get health coverage"" is not accurate as it does not provide specific details about the program or the cost structure. The claim ""reduced that, on average, to about $150 a month"" is also not accurate as it does not provide a source or specific details about the reduction in cost. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
591,"Explanation: Same-sex marriage is a legal recognition of a marriage between two people of the same sex. This practice has been legalized in many countries and is widely accepted in many societies. Therefore, the claim that same-sex marriage is a true statement.

Answer: 1"
592,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Sen. Morgan Carroll's votes have made it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, or nurses. The claim is a political attack and does not reflect the actual impact of her votes. Additionally, the use of the term ""shady interests"" is a derogatory and unfounded accusation.

Answer: 0"
593,"Explanation: The claim that the vaccine to prevent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) can cause mental retardation is false. There is no scientific evidence to support this claim. The HPV vaccine is safe and effective in preventing HPV infections, which can lead to certain types of cancer. The vaccine does not cause mental retardation or any other serious side effects. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the vaccine's side effects, which are generally mild and temporary, such as pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.

Answer: 0"
594,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the taxes and fees that were increased over the prior eight years. Without concrete information or sources, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
595,"Explanation: The claim is subjective and cannot be objectively verified as true or false without additional context or evidence. It is a personal perception or opinion, and it is not a factual statement that can be proven true or false.

Answer: 0"
596,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not made such a specific statement about the impact of comprehensive immigration reform on the federal deficit. While the CBO has analyzed the economic effects of immigration policies, it has not provided a specific figure of $200 billion reduction in the federal deficit over the next decade.

Answer: 0"
597,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama opposed a bill that would have saved Gianna Jessen's life is false. Gianna Jessen is a woman who was born in 1991 and survived a failed abortion attempt. The claim that Obama opposed a bill to save her life is a misinterpretation of events. Obama was not involved in the specific legislation or events surrounding Gianna Jessen's birth and survival. The claim is a part of a broader conspiracy theory that has been debunked by fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
598,"Explanation: The claim that the United States is undertaxed compared to its competitors is a complex issue that depends on various factors such as the type of taxes, the tax rates, and the overall tax burden. The U.S. has a relatively low corporate tax rate compared to many other developed countries, but it also has a high effective tax rate due to various deductions and credits. Additionally, the U.S. has a progressive income tax system, which means that higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the U.S. is undertaxed compared to its competitors without considering these nuances.

Answer: 0"
599,"Explanation: The claim states that the elections proposal would allow a potential of 168 hours (of early voting), which is the most we've ever had. However, the claim does not provide any specific context or source to verify this information.

Answer: 0"
600,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support the statement that members of the public are being charged $50 to hear Gov. Scott Walker and a dozen members of his administration talk about jobs and the economy at Lambeau Field. This information is not reported by any reliable news outlets or official sources.

Answer: 0"
601,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the Commonwealth Fund, which found that 7.5 million Americans gained access to health care through Medicaid expansion in 2021. This study was conducted by a reputable organization and the numbers are supported by data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
602,"Explanation: According to the IRS, in 2019, about 44% of Americans did not pay any federal income tax. This is because they either earned less than the standard deduction ($12,550 for a single filer in 2019) or had enough tax credits to offset their tax liability. Therefore, the claim that ""half the Americans don't pay any income taxes"" is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
603,"Explanation: The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech, including hate speech. However, there are exceptions to this protection, such as when speech incites imminent lawless action or is considered ""fighting words."" Therefore, while hate speech is generally protected, it is not entirely excluded from protection under the First Amendment.

Answer: 0"
604,"Explanation: The claim that the top 1 percent of income-earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government is generally accurate. According to data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various studies, the top 1 percent of income-earners in the United States do indeed contribute a significant portion of federal taxes. For instance, in 2018, the top 1 percent of earners paid approximately 40 percent of all federal income taxes.

Answer: 1"
605,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of data: deaths from tainted food in the United States and deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), foodborne illnesses cause an estimated 48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths in the United States each year. On the other hand, as of 2021, the total number of U.S. military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began is approximately 7,000. Therefore, the claim that more people were killed in the United States last year by tainted food than U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began is false.

Answer: 0"
606,"Explanation: The claim states that Marco Rubio requested 37 earmarks worth $43 million in 2002. However, this information is not accurate. Marco Rubio was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, not in 2002. Therefore, he could not have requested earmarks in 2002.

Answer: 0"
607,"Explanation: The claim is false. The CARES Act, which is the economic stimulus plan referenced, does not contain any provisions that prohibit students from meeting together in their dorms for religious activities such as prayer groups or Bible studies. The CARES Act primarily focuses on providing financial relief to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it does not impose restrictions on religious gatherings in dormitories.

Answer: 0"
608,"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration notified Poland and the Czech Republic about the cancellation of major missile-defense facilities ""at the last minute in midnight phone calls"" is false. The U.S. missile defense system in Europe, known as the European Phased Adaptive Defense (EPAA), was not canceled by the Obama administration. The system was scaled back in 2013, but this was a planned and gradual process, not a sudden cancellation. The claim of midnight phone calls is also not supported by any credible sources.

Answer: 0"
609,"Explanation: The claim about city leadership threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget is not verifiable with the information provided. Without specific sources or official statements from the city leadership, it is impossible to confirm the authenticity of this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0/1"
610,"Explanation: The claim that one out of every three automobile fatalities can be attributed to alcohol is not accurate. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2019, 29% of all traffic fatalities involved alcohol. This means that approximately 29 out of every 100 traffic fatalities were alcohol-related, not one out of every three.

Answer: 0"
611,"Explanation: The claim that a million people could get health insurance right away if Texas expanded Medicaid under Obamacare is based on a misunderstanding of how Medicaid expansion works. Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) would indeed provide health insurance to many more people in Texas, but the number of people who could get health insurance immediately would depend on various factors, including the state's implementation plan, existing healthcare infrastructure, and the number of people who are eligible but not currently enrolled. The claim of ""a million people"" is an oversimplification and not a precise estimate.

Answer: 0"
612,"Explanation: The claim is false. Mark Kirk, a former U.S. Senator from Illinois, has not called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that he was fine with Trump's call for mass deportation. These claims are likely misinformation or misattribution.

Answer: 0"
613,"Explanation: The claim that Warren Buffett called credit default swaps (CDS) ""financial weapons of mass destruction"" is true. Buffett made this statement in 2002, expressing his concern about the potential risks and systemic impact of CDS. However, the claim that Greene was the first individual to use them is false. CDS have been used by various financial institutions and individuals for decades before the 2008 financial crisis.

Answer: 1"
614,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have specific data on the murder rate in Atlanta for the current year. However, I can provide some context. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the murder rate in Atlanta has been fluctuating over the years, with no clear trend indicating a significant rise in 2023. Without specific data for 2023, it's challenging to definitively say whether the murder rate is on the rise.

Answer: 0"
615,"Explanation: The claim that George Allencast was the deciding vote for the 2003 Bush tax cuts is false. George Allencast is not a well-known figure in U.S. politics, and there is no evidence to suggest that he played a role in the 2003 Bush tax cuts. The 2003 tax cuts were passed with bipartisan support, and the deciding votes were cast by members of Congress, not by a figure named George Allencast.

Answer: 0"
616,"Explanation: The claim that Ron DeSantis, as governor of Florida, defunded Planned Parenthood is false. While DeSantis has been critical of Planned Parenthood and has implemented policies that have reduced funding for the organization, he has not personally defunded it. The state of Florida has redirected funds from Planned Parenthood to other health services, but this was done through state legislation and not directly by DeSantis.

Answer: 0"
617,"Explanation: The claim that German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s is a simplification of a complex historical process. While it is true that the Nazi regime implemented policies to disarm and control the German population, the process was gradual and involved various measures, including the registration of firearms, the creation of a national registry, and the eventual prohibition of private ownership of firearms. However, the claim that this disarmament allowed the Nazis to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance is an oversimplification. The Nazi regime's ability to carry out its atrocities was due to a combination of factors, including the regime's control over the police and military, the use of propaganda and terror, and the complicity of many Germans. The disarmament of the German population was one factor among many that contributed to the regime's ability to carry out its evil intentions.

Answer: 0"
618,"Explanation: The claim is false. Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was enacted, Florida parents could indeed purchase child-only coverage for their children. However, the ACA did not eliminate this choice; instead, it expanded access to affordable health insurance for children and adults alike. The ACA's consumer protections, such as the requirement for insurers to cover pre-existing conditions and the expansion of Medicaid, have actually increased the availability of affordable health insurance options for Florida residents.

Answer: 0"
619,"Explanation: The claim that Congress adjourned earliest of any time in congressional history before an election is false. While it is true that Congress has adjourned early before elections in the past, there is no definitive record of the earliest adjournment in congressional history. The claim is not supported by historical data or reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
620,"Explanation: The claim is false. Medicaid expansion funding is primarily sourced from the federal government, not from foreign countries like China. The federal government provides the majority of the funding for Medicaid programs, with states contributing a smaller portion. The claim that 46 cents of every dollar for Medicaid expansion is coming from China or another country that doesn't like the U.S. is a misrepresentation of the funding sources.

Answer: 0"
621,"Explanation: The claim is false. Congressman Nye did not vote against a bill that would have defunded the IRS. The IRS is not involved in implementing health care legislation. The IRS is responsible for tax collection and administration, not health care. Therefore, there is no bill that would have defunded the IRS for health care legislation.

Answer: 0"
622,"Explanation: The claim that Greece has a GDP the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is false. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex has a GDP of approximately $400 billion, while Greece's GDP is around $240 billion. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
623,"Explanation: The claim is false. Trey Radel, a former Republican congressman from Florida, did not have a driving license revoked or any other legal issue that would prevent him from driving a school bus. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation of his legal troubles, which were unrelated to his driving ability. He was convicted of misdemeanor charges related to a drug possession incident, but this did not affect his ability to drive or hold his seat in Congress.

Answer: 0"
624,"Explanation: The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a trade agreement between 12 countries, including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The agreement was signed in 2016 but has not been ratified by all member countries. Therefore, the claim that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a current agreement is false.

Answer: 0"
625,"Explanation: The claim that Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' The Second Amendment included a ban on the manufacture, sale, and possession of handguns is false. While President Obama did propose a series of executive actions and legislative proposals to address gun violence, none of these included a ban on handguns. His proposals focused on expanding background checks, closing loopholes, and addressing mental health issues, but did not include a ban on handguns.

Answer: 0"
626,"Explanation: The claim that Muslims have been in America since George Washington is false. While there is evidence of Muslims in America before the 20th century, the first significant Muslim presence in the United States began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily with immigrants from the Middle East and South Asia. The first Muslim community in the United States was established in 1893 in Dearborn, Michigan, by immigrants from Lebanon. Therefore, the claim that Muslims have been in America since George Washington is an exaggeration and not historically accurate.

Answer: 0"
627,"Explanation: Bernie Sanders has consistently advocated for universal education and has supported policies that ensure all children have access to quality education from kindergarten through 12th grade. He has not publicly opposed the requirement for all children to have a K-12 education.

Answer: 0"
628,"Explanation: The claim that Dan Sullivan, as Alaska's Attorney General, successfully fought to protect Second Amendment rights and passed ""stand your ground"" legislation is false. Dan Sullivan served as Alaska's Attorney General from 2014 to 2018, but he did not pass any ""stand your ground"" legislation. The ""stand your ground"" law was already in place in Alaska before his tenure. Additionally, while Sullivan has been a vocal supporter of the Second Amendment, his actions as Attorney General did not involve passing new legislation to protect Second Amendment rights.

Answer: 0"
629,"Explanation: The claim that ""his political opponents brought 100,000 protesters into our state"" is a subjective statement that cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence. The number of protesters and their motivations can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances and the source of the information. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0/1"
630,"Explanation: The claim that Texas is the second state in the nation for new gun purchases, behind California, is false. According to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data, California has consistently been the top state for firearm background checks, which are often used as a proxy for gun purchases. Texas is typically ranked higher than California in terms of total firearm background checks, but not in the context of new gun purchases specifically.

Answer: 0"
631,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate in the United States has been declining since 2010, and the poverty rate in 2020 was 9.1%, compared to 12.7% in 2000. Additionally, the claim that productivity has risen 18 percent is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, productivity growth has been relatively low in recent years, with an average annual growth rate of around 1.4% from 2000 to 2020.

Answer: 0"
632,"Explanation: The claim that the president gave the (auto) companies to the UAW is false. The UAW (United Auto Workers) is a labor union, not a government entity. The president does not have the authority to give companies to a union. The UAW represents workers in the automotive industry, but it does not own or control any companies.

Answer: 0"
633,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that both Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton had low approval ratings after seven months in office, the claim that only they had worse ratings than President Obama is incorrect. President Obama's approval ratings after seven months in office were significantly lower than those of Ford and Clinton. According to Gallup polls, Obama's approval rating after seven months in office was around 60%, while Ford's was around 40% and Clinton's was around 50%.

Answer: 0"
634,"Explanation: The claim is a misinterpretation of Barack Obama's health care proposal. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama stated that ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" However, this statement was later clarified by the Obama administration to mean that people could keep their existing plans if they chose to do so, but the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would also provide new options for those who did not have coverage or whose plans were inadequate. The claim that people could keep their plans without any changes is a simplification and a misrepresentation of the actual policy.

Answer: 0"
635,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. The major immigration issue in the UK has indeed involved Poles, Bulgarians, and Romanians, among other EU countries. However, the claim that they were not contributing economically is a generalization and not entirely accurate. Many of these immigrants have contributed significantly to the UK economy through their work and taxes. Additionally, the unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is indeed lower than the unemployment rate among Brits, according to various studies and data from the UK Office for National Statistics.

Answer: 1"
636,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has had a mixed impact on healthcare costs, quality, and access. While the law has expanded access to healthcare for many Americans, it has also led to increased premiums for some individuals and businesses. Additionally, the quality of care can vary widely depending on factors such as location, provider, and insurance plan. Therefore, the claim that ""everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access"" is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
637,"Explanation: The claim that Trump's Health Secretary Pick wants a Medicare phaseout by summer 2017 is false. The Health Secretary Pick in question is Tom Price, who was appointed by Trump in 2017. Tom Price did not advocate for a Medicare phaseout. In fact, he was a strong supporter of Medicare and opposed any efforts to dismantle or phase out the program. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his views.

Answer: 0"
638,"Explanation: The claim that health insurance companies deny 1 out of 5 treatments prescribed by doctors is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. While it is true that insurance companies may deny or limit coverage for certain treatments, the rate of denial is not as high as 20%. According to various studies and reports, the denial rate varies but is generally lower. For example, a study by the Health Care Cost Institute found that the denial rate for medical services was around 10% in 2019. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
639,"Explanation: The claim that the United States is no longer the top nation in the globe on infrastructure and has fallen to 15th is based on a report from the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2019. The report ranked the United States 13th in infrastructure quality, which is not the same as being the top nation globally. The claim is therefore misleading as it suggests a more significant drop in ranking than what the report actually indicates.

Answer: 0"
640,"Explanation: The claim that the United States does not trade as much as other developed nations is not accurate. The United States is one of the largest trading nations in the world. According to the World Bank, the United States had a total trade value of $4.2 trillion in 2020, which is higher than many other developed nations. For example, Germany had a total trade value of $3.7 trillion, and Japan had $2.1 trillion. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
641,"Explanation: Ted Cruz served as the Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008. However, the claim that he was the ""longest-serving solicitor general in the history of Texas"" is false because there have been other individuals who have served in this position for longer periods. For example, Ken Paxton, who is currently the Attorney General of Texas, served as the Solicitor General from 2008 to 2011, which is a longer tenure than Ted Cruz's.

Answer: 0"
642,"Explanation: The claim that polls on legalizing same-sex marriage are not dramatically changing is not accurate. In fact, polls have shown a significant shift in public opinion towards supporting same-sex marriage. For example, a 2021 Gallup poll found that 70% of Americans support same-sex marriage, which is a significant increase from the 57% who supported it in 2004. Therefore, the claim that polls are not dramatically changing is false.

Answer: 0"
643,"Explanation: The claim that the McCain campaign ""did not elaborate"" on Obama's ties to ACORN is false. In fact, the McCain campaign and other Republican figures did extensively discuss and allege ties between Barack Obama and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). These allegations were a significant part of the 2008 presidential campaign, with McCain and others accusing ACORN of voter fraud and suggesting that Obama had some form of association with the organization. The claim that the McCain campaign did not elaborate on this issue is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
644,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the House health care bill. The ""public option"" refers to a government-run health insurance plan that would compete with private insurance companies. The claim that ""something like 2 percent of the people would be eligible even to get the public option"" is not accurate. The public option would be available to all Americans, not just 2 percent. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
645,"Explanation: The claim that Senator John McCain would pay for part of his healthcare plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare worth $882 billion is false. Senator McCain's healthcare plan, proposed during his 2008 presidential campaign, did not include such a specific figure or proposal. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his actual proposals.

Answer: 0"
646,"Explanation: The claim that Oregon's political tax credit is something every state should have and no other state does is false. While Oregon does offer a political contribution tax credit, it is not unique to Oregon. Many other states also offer similar tax credits or deductions for political contributions.

Answer: 0"
647,"Explanation: The claim is false. The average price of regular gasoline in the United States when Barack Obama was sworn in as President in 2009 was indeed around $3.07 per gallon. However, the current price of $2.30 per gallon is not accurate. As of my last update in October 2023, the average price of regular gasoline in the United States is around $3.50 per gallon. Therefore, the claim that gas prices have been reduced to $2.30 today is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
648,"Explanation: The claim is false. Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich are both Democrats, and they have both voted in favor of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which included prescription drug benefits for seniors. Kucinich voted in favor of the bill, not against it.

Answer: 0"
649,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""I released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics"" is a subjective claim and cannot be objectively verified without specific evidence. Additionally, the statement ""You dont learn much in a tax return"" is a general statement and does not provide any specific information about the claimant's financial review.

Answer: 0"
650,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin's effective unemployment rate is 20 percent is false. As of my last update in October 2023, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is significantly lower than 20 percent. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate in Wisconsin was around 3.5% in September 2023. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
651,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of the latest available data, the Milwaukee Police Department has seized a significantly smaller number of firearms compared to the New York City Police Department. The Milwaukee Police Department has seized around 1,000 firearms in 2022, while the New York City Police Department has seized over 10,000 firearms in the same period. Therefore, the claim that Milwaukee has seized nearly as many firearms as New York City is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
652,"Explanation: Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1989 to 2017, has been criticized for her stance on veterans' issues, including the VA backlog. However, it is important to note that her voting record on this issue is complex and nuanced. While she has voted against some measures aimed at fixing the VA backlog, she has also supported other initiatives to improve veterans' care. Therefore, the claim that she has a ""long record of voting against VA backlog fixes"" is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
653,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. does not have a law that commits it to spending 0.7 percent of its gross national product (GNP) on foreign aid. The U.S. does contribute to foreign aid, but the percentage of GNP spent on foreign aid varies and is not fixed at 0.7 percent. The U.S. is one of the largest contributors to foreign aid, but it does not have a specific law mandating a 0.7 percent commitment.

Answer: 0"
654,"Explanation: The claim that there has been a substantial increase in federal government jobs under President Obama is true. According to data from the Office of Personnel Management, the number of federal employees increased from approximately 2.1 million in 2009 to about 2.7 million in 2016, which is a significant increase. This growth was driven by various factors, including the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the hiring of additional employees to manage the new programs.

Answer: 1"
655,"Explanation: The claim is false. There are multiple candidates running for lieutenant governor in various states, and it is not accurate to say that the claimant is the only candidate opposing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the candidate's stance.

Answer: 0"
656,"Explanation: The term ""color revolution"" was coined after the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. The concept refers to a series of popular uprisings that have taken place in various countries, often involving the use of color as a symbol of protest. The 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine was indeed the first event to be widely recognized as a ""color revolution."" Therefore, the claim that the Ukraine Orange Revolution in 2004 was the first color revolution is true.

Answer: 1"
657,"Explanation: The claim that the health bill's plan for comparative effectiveness research would be used by the government to ration care is a misinterpretation of the purpose of such research. Comparative effectiveness research aims to compare the effectiveness of different treatments, not to ration care. The goal is to provide evidence-based information to help patients and healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment options. The idea of rationing care is not a part of the research's intended use.

Answer: 0"
658,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio wages have increased by $10.3 billion under Gov. Kasich is misleading. While it is true that Ohio's economy has seen wage growth during Kasich's tenure, the $10.3 billion figure is not accurate. This figure seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of data. The actual increase in wages is not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
659,"Explanation: The claim about new carbon regulations increasing electric bills by $17 billion every year and potentially putting an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year is not supported by credible sources. The figures provided are not backed by any reputable studies or official reports. Additionally, the impact of carbon regulations on electric bills and employment is complex and depends on various factors, including the specific regulations, the efficiency of the energy sector, and the economic conditions. Therefore, the claim is likely to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual impact.

Answer: 0"
660,"Explanation: The claim that ""Qataris don't really work"" is a generalization and stereotype that is not accurate. Qatar, like many other countries, has a diverse workforce that includes both Qataris and expatriates. Qataris are actively involved in various sectors of the economy, including government, private businesses, and professional services. The country has been investing in education and workforce development to ensure its citizens are well-equipped to contribute to the economy. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
661,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, New Jersey has the highest property tax rate in the nation, but it is not more than double the national average. The national average property tax rate is around 1.1%, while New Jersey's average is around 2.2%.

Answer: 0"
662,"Explanation: The claim states that a particular state in the U.S. was one of the first to build sewers and bring a treatment plant online. However, without specific information about which state is being referred to, it is impossible to verify the claim. Sewer systems and treatment plants were developed in various states across the U.S. at different times, and there is no universally accepted first state for this achievement.

Answer: 0"
663,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is no significant difference between Donald Trump's immigration policies and those of Congressman Joe Heck. However, this is a simplification and an oversimplification. While both Trump and Heck are Republicans and share some common views on immigration, there are notable differences. For instance, Trump's immigration policies have been more restrictive and controversial, including the construction of a border wall, the travel ban, and the separation of families at the border. Heck, while also a Republican, has been more moderate on immigration issues. Therefore, the claim that there is no policy difference between Trump and Heck is false.

Answer: 0"
664,"Explanation: The claim that property insurance rates are going up because Rick Scott signed a bill preventing the state from regulating insurance is not accurate. While it is true that Rick Scott signed a bill that limited the state's ability to regulate insurance rates, the increase in property insurance rates is primarily due to factors such as increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, higher construction costs, and other market-driven factors. The bill itself does not directly cause the increase in rates.

Answer: 0"
665,"Explanation: John McCain, a prominent Republican politician, was known for his strong opposition to Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy. He publicly criticized her and did not endorse her for president. Therefore, the claim that he said Hillary Clinton would make a good president is false.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
667,"Explanation: The claim states that the government workforce was reduced by 13,000, which is 11 percent during an eight-year period. To verify this claim, we would need to check the official government records or reliable sources that provide data on government workforce changes over time. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
668,"Explanation: As of 2021, China holds the largest portion of U.S. Treasury securities, with a total of $1.08 trillion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's data. This is indeed more than the amount held by Americans, which is approximately $1.02 trillion. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
669,"Explanation: The claim that Governor Sarah Palin is the most popular governor in the country is not accurate. Popularity can be measured in various ways, such as approval ratings, media coverage, or public opinion polls. While Governor Palin has been a prominent figure in American politics, her popularity has varied over time and is not consistently the highest among all governors. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that she is the most popular governor in the country.

Answer: 0"
670,"Explanation: The claim ""I'm pro-life. He's not."" is a statement about the political beliefs of two individuals. It does not provide any specific information or evidence to support the claim. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of this statement without additional context or information.

Answer: 0"
671,"Explanation: The motto ""Live Free or Die"" is indeed associated with New Hampshire. It was adopted as the state motto in 1945, and it reflects the state's historical commitment to individual liberties and independence. The phrase was first used by General John Stark, a hero of the American Revolution, in a speech in 1809. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
672,"Explanation: The claim that Economic Development Commission Executive Director Keith Stokes sent a letter stating that taxpayers will never be on the hook for the bonds of 38 Studios is false. There is no evidence or official statement from Keith Stokes or the Economic Development Commission that supports this claim. The bonds for 38 Studios were indeed a significant financial burden for the state of Rhode Island, and the taxpayers were ultimately responsible for the debt.

Answer: 0"
673,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by Bill McCollum, a former U.S. Representative from Florida. The statement ""You can't do everything"" is a general statement that does not specifically address mortgage fraud or any other particular issue. It is a common phrase used to acknowledge the limitations of one's abilities or resources. Therefore, the claim is true as it accurately represents a statement made by Bill McCollum.

Answer: 1"
674,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was indeed created by Congress in 1969, but it was not intended to affect only 155 wealthy Americans. The AMT was designed to ensure that high-income individuals paid at least a minimum amount of tax, regardless of deductions and credits. Over time, due to inflation and changes in tax laws, the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has increased. However, the claim that it was originally intended to affect only 155 taxpayers and that this number has increased to 3.5 million by 2006 is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
675,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Russia and China have active human spaceflight programs, there are other nations that also have this capability. For example, the European Space Agency (ESA) has the capability to launch humans into space through its cooperation with the International Space Station (ISS). Additionally, private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have plans to launch humans into space, and SpaceX has already done so with its Crew Dragon spacecraft. Therefore, the claim that Russia and China will be the only nations with this capability is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
676,"Explanation: The claim that someone couldn't take stimulus money because it required ""universal building codes"" is false. The stimulus money, such as the Economic Impact Payments (EIP) provided by the U.S. government, is not contingent on meeting universal building codes. These payments are designed to provide financial relief to individuals and families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are not tied to any specific building or construction requirements.

Answer: 0"
677,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Almost 10 percent of Canadians came to visit Florida last year"" is not supported by any reliable data source. Additionally, the claim that ""Canadians buy 7.4 percent of our homes in the state"" is not accurate as it does not provide a source or context for this percentage.

Answer: 0"
678,"Explanation: The Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), does not entirely trust Iran to inspect itself. The deal includes provisions for international inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify Iran's compliance with the agreement. The IAEA has the authority to inspect Iran's nuclear facilities and monitor its nuclear activities. Therefore, the claim that the Iran deal trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves is false.

Answer: 0"
679,"Explanation: The claim suggests that efforts to remove special diversity status from airport contractors have no impact on the contracts or the city's diversity goals. This claim is false because removing special diversity status typically means that the contractors are no longer given preferential treatment in bidding processes or contract awards. This change can indeed affect the contracts and the city's diversity goals, as it may lead to different contractors being selected based on merit rather than diversity considerations.

Answer: 0"
680,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of women killed by their husbands or boyfriends since September 11, 2001, to the number of Americans killed in the 9/11 attacks and in Afghanistan and Iraq. The claim is false because it is not possible to accurately compare these two figures. The number of women killed by their partners is a statistic that is tracked by various organizations and law enforcement agencies, but it is not a direct comparison to the number of Americans killed in specific conflicts. The number of Americans killed in 9/11 and in Afghanistan and Iraq is a well-documented figure, but it is not comparable to the number of women killed by their partners.

Answer: 0"
681,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that some Muslim-majority countries have restrictions on the construction of churches and synagogues, it is not accurate to say that this is a universal rule in all Muslim countries. For instance, in countries like Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population, churches and synagogues are allowed and can be found. Similarly, in countries like Turkey, there are churches and synagogues, although their numbers and visibility may vary. The claim also oversimplifies the complex legal and social landscapes of these countries.

Answer: 0"
682,"Explanation: The claim that award-winning Milwaukee Public Schools teacher Megan Sampson was laid off because Gov. Scott Walker cut state aid to education is false. While it is true that Gov. Scott Walker implemented budget cuts to education during his tenure, there is no evidence to suggest that Megan Sampson was specifically laid off due to these cuts. The claim is a misattribution of the cause of Sampson's layoff.

Answer: 0"
683,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama said ""when we got bin Laden, terrorism problem solved"" is a misquote. The actual quote from President Obama was ""We have taken a significant step forward in our efforts to protect the American people and to disrupt the terrorist network that attacked us on 9/11."" This statement was made in a press conference after the death of Osama bin Laden, but it did not claim that terrorism was solved. The claim is therefore false.

684,"Explanation: Lloyd Doggett is a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Texas' 10th congressional district. He served from 1995 to 2019. During his tenure, he voted on various pieces of legislation, including healthcare reform, stimulus packages, and cap-and-trade bills.

Answer: 1"
685,"Explanation: Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. This has been confirmed by multiple official documents, including his birth certificate, which is publicly available.

Answer: 1"
686,"Explanation: The claim that the merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make GSU one of the largest universities in the nation with more than 54,000 students is false. While the merger will indeed combine the student populations of both institutions, the total number of students will not exceed the current enrollment of Georgia State University, which is around 50,000 students. The claim of having more than 54,000 students is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
687,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) which found that black and Hispanic applicants were more likely to be denied a mortgage than white applicants with similar credentials. The study found that black applicants were 2.5 times more likely to be denied a mortgage than white applicants, and Hispanic applicants were 1.5 times more likely to be denied a mortgage than white applicants. Therefore, the claim that you are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic is an exaggeration of the findings.

Answer: 0"
688,"Explanation: As of 2021, the United States is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. produced approximately 12.3 million barrels of oil per day in 2021, which is more than any other country. Therefore, the claim that ""America is No. 1 in oil and gas"" is true.

Answer: 1"
689,"Explanation: The claim that ""almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood) pregnancy services were abortions"" is misleading and inaccurate. According to Planned Parenthood's own data, abortions account for about 3% of their total services. The majority of their services include contraception, cancer screenings, and other preventive health care. The claim likely stems from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the data.

Answer: 0"
690,"Explanation: The claim ""There was no panhandling when I left office"" is a subjective statement and cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence. Panhandling can be a local issue that varies based on time, location, and specific circumstances. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny this claim without more information.

Answer: 0"
691,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While there were demonstrations during the 2005 Social Security debate, the description of the opponents as ""not disruptive crowds"" is an oversimplification. There were indeed protests and some disruption, including booing and heckling, but the claim that opponents were not disruptive crowds is an exaggeration. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
692,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was created in 1997, and it is a federal program that provides health coverage to children from low-income families. The number of children covered by CHIP varies by state and year, but it is not accurate to say that 7,000 kids in New Hampshire are covered by CHIP due to a specific individual's efforts. The claim is misleading and does not provide accurate information about the program's impact.

Answer: 0"
693,"Explanation: Brian Kemp served as the Secretary of State of Georgia from 2018 to 2022. Prior to this, he served as the Georgia State Representative from 2007 to 2018. Therefore, he has held elected office for a significant period, making him a career politician.

Answer: 1"
694,"Explanation: The claim suggests a correlation between states that passed anti-illegal-immigrant legislation and the number of Hispanic legislators in those states. However, this claim does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion. It is a general statement that does not necessarily reflect the reality of the situation. The number of Hispanic legislators in a state can be influenced by various factors, including the state's demographics, political climate, and historical context, not just the presence of anti-illegal-immigrant legislation.

Answer: 0"
695,"Explanation: Expanding Medicaid in Texas would actually improve healthcare options for the most vulnerable. The expansion would provide coverage to more low-income individuals and families, increasing access to healthcare services. This would not worsen healthcare options but rather enhance them. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
696,"Explanation: The claim that unemployment rivals the Great Depression is an exaggeration. While the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in unemployment rates, they did not reach the levels seen during the Great Depression. In the U.S., unemployment peaked at around 14.8% in April 2020, while during the Great Depression, unemployment rates reached over 25%. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
697,"Explanation: Sen. John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was a strong advocate for the U.S. military presence in Iraq. He supported the surge of U.S. troops in 2007 and was critical of the Obama administration's timeline for withdrawal. However, he also emphasized the importance of working with the Iraqi government and respecting the wishes of the Iraqi people. Therefore, the claim that Sen. McCain would occupy Iraq indefinitely against their wishes is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
698,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. crude oil production has indeed increased significantly since 2008. In 2008, the U.S. produced about 5.0 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil. By 2021, this had increased to over 11.0 million bpd, a rise of over 80 percent. This is the fastest increase in U.S. history in terms of both percentage and absolute numbers.

Answer: 1"
699,"Explanation: The claim that deportations from the interior of the country are way down under President Obama is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the number of deportations from the interior of the country actually increased under President Obama. In 2016, the last full year of his presidency, ICE reported 255,625 deportations from the interior, which was a significant increase from the 2009 figure of 195,000. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
700,"Explanation: The claim that the Texas economy is about 30 percent larger than Australia's is false. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Texas in 2021 was approximately $1.7 trillion, while Australia's GDP was around $1.4 trillion. This means Texas' economy is about 21.4% larger than Australia's, not 30%.

Answer: 0"
701,"Explanation: The claim that hair stylists are required to undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants is false. The level of government scrutiny for professionals typically depends on the nature of their work and the potential risks they pose to the public. Hair stylists are regulated by state boards of cosmetology, which oversee their licensing and practice, but this is generally not considered more stringent than the regulations for foreclosure consultants. Foreclosure consultants are regulated by state real estate boards and must adhere to specific laws and regulations, but there is no evidence to suggest that they are subject to more scrutiny than hair stylists.

Answer: 0"
702,"Explanation: The claim that ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people is likely an exaggeration. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses (defined as those with fewer than 500 employees) account for 99.7% of all U.S. businesses and employ 47.5% of the private workforce. However, this does not mean that 90% of all workers are employed by companies with fewer than 100 employees. The claim seems to be an overgeneralization.

Answer: 0"
703,"Explanation: The claim that ""Thirty-four percent of Hispanics don't have any health care at all, don't have any health insurance"" is based on a specific study or data source. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, approximately 17.9% of Hispanics were uninsured. This figure is significantly lower than the 34% stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
704,"Explanation: There is no historical evidence to suggest that Abraham Lincoln was a fan of wrestling. While Lincoln was known for his physical strength and enjoyed outdoor activities, wrestling was not a sport he is recorded to have participated in or enjoyed. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a myth.

Answer: 0"
705,"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create a $1,761 yearly energy tax is false. The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which was the cap-and-trade plan proposed by the Obama administration, did not impose a $1,761 yearly energy tax on households. The act aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on emissions and allowing companies to trade permits. The actual impact on energy prices and household costs was complex and varied, but it did not result in a $1,761 yearly tax for all households.

Answer: 0"
706,"Explanation: The claim about Hillary Clinton's refugee plan is a misrepresentation of her actual policy proposals. Hillary Clinton's plan, as outlined during her 2016 presidential campaign, did not propose to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term. The figure of 620,000 is a fabrication and is not supported by any credible sources. Additionally, the claim that her plan would cost $400 billion in lifetime welfare and entitlement costs is also false. The cost estimates for refugee resettlement programs are significantly lower and are typically funded through a combination of federal and state funds, not through lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.

Answer: 0"
707,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific data indicating that Rhode Island is leading the nation in foreclosures. Foreclosure rates can vary significantly by state and are influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, housing market trends, and local policies. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to refer to the latest data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or other reputable real estate market analysis firms.

Answer: 0"
708,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. The law aimed to increase access to health insurance and reduce the number of uninsured Americans. While the ACA did increase government spending, it also generated revenue through taxes and reduced costs through other provisions. The claim that the ACA will add trillions of dollars in debt is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the ACA would reduce the federal deficit by $145 billion over the 2016-2025 period.

Answer: 0"
709,"Explanation: The claim is false. Undocumented students who graduate from college can apply for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or other forms of relief, such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which can allow them to work legally in the United States. Additionally, some states and cities have policies that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and other forms of identification, which can help them secure jobs. The claim that they cannot get a job is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
710,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the economic impact of stadiums and sports franchises. While there are studies that suggest mixed or negative impacts, it is not accurate to say that ""no consistent, positive impact"" has been found. Some studies have shown positive impacts on local economies, including job creation and increased tax revenues. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
711,"Explanation: The claim that the person voted against an increase in the minimum wage in the 1980s is false. The minimum wage in the United States was last increased in 2009, and there have been no significant increases since then. Therefore, it is not possible for the person to have voted against an increase in the minimum wage in the 1980s.

Answer: 0"
712,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government owns tens of thousands of properties that are vacant or underused is true. According to various reports and studies, the U.S. government does indeed own a significant number of properties that are either vacant or underutilized. For instance, the General Services Administration (GSA) manages a portfolio of federal properties, and it has been reported that a substantial portion of these properties are either vacant or underused. This information is widely documented in various government reports and media outlets.

Answer: 1"
713,"Explanation: The claim suggests that representing an ex-boyfriend in a family law case is a common practice for lawyers. While it is possible for a lawyer to represent someone they have a personal relationship with, it is not a regular or common practice due to potential conflicts of interest. Lawyers are generally advised to avoid representing individuals with whom they have a personal or romantic relationship to maintain professional integrity and avoid bias.

Answer: 0"
714,"Explanation: The claim that you cannot pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes is false. In the United States Senate, a simple majority (51 votes) is required to pass most bills, including budgets. However, certain types of legislation, such as those involving the filibuster, may require a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. But for a budget, a simple majority is sufficient.

Answer: 0"
715,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not advocate for a freeze on foreclosures during her 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, she proposed a plan to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, which included a ""temporary freeze on foreclosures"" for a period of time. Barack Obama, during his presidency, did not say ""no"" to a freeze on foreclosures. He implemented a program called the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.

Answer: 0"
716,"Explanation: The claim that ""Our pension system is the only one in the country that's 100 percent funded"" is false. In the United States, there are multiple types of pension systems, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, and hybrid plans. Each of these systems has different funding mechanisms and levels of funding. For example, the Social Security system is a defined benefit plan that is funded through payroll taxes, but it is not 100 percent funded. Similarly, many private pension plans are not 100 percent funded. Therefore, the claim that the pension system is the only one that is 100 percent funded is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
717,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the introduction of guns into national parks in 2010 led to a significant reduction in violent crimes such as rapes, murders, robberies, and assaults. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim. The National Park Service does not allow guns in national parks, and any changes in crime rates would be influenced by a multitude of factors, not just the presence of guns. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to back up the 85% reduction in crime.

Answer: 0"
718,"Explanation: Newt Gingrich has indeed been a proponent of selecting a president by popular vote instead of the Electoral College. He has publicly advocated for this change, arguing that it would make the election process more democratic and reflective of the will of the majority of voters.

Answer: 1"
719,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama said ""he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace (Iranian President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad"" is false. There is no evidence or record of Barack Obama making such a statement. This claim appears to be a fabrication or misinterpretation of his policies and statements.

Answer: 0"
720,"Explanation: The claim that incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994 is not accurate. While the VAWA has been credited with increasing awareness and providing resources for victims, the overall trend in domestic violence rates has been more complex. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, while there has been a decrease in domestic violence incidents, the rate of decline has not been consistent and has not reached a 50 percent reduction. Additionally, the most recent data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that the rate of intimate partner violence has fluctuated over time, with no clear trend of a 50 percent decrease since 1994.

Answer: 0"
721,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information that indicates Gerald Daugherty is endorsed by the Austin American-Statesman. Endorsements by major news outlets are typically publicized and can be verified through official statements or press releases. Therefore, without such evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that this claim is false.

Answer: 0"
722,"Explanation: The claim that under Cuccinellis tax cut plan, school divisions across Virginia could be forced to fire over 8,000 teachers is based on a misinterpretation of the tax cut plan's impact. The tax cut plan proposed by Governor Glenn Youngkin (not Cuccinelli) primarily affects the state's budget, which includes education funding. While the plan could potentially lead to budget cuts, the exact number of teachers that could be affected is not specified and would depend on various factors, including how the budget cuts are allocated. Therefore, the claim that over 8,000 teachers could be fired is an exaggeration and not supported by concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
723,"Explanation: The claim that the insurance industry is mostly run by Democrats is not accurate. The insurance industry is a large and diverse sector that includes a wide range of companies and individuals from various political backgrounds. While it is true that some prominent insurance executives or companies may have Democratic leanings, it is not accurate to say that the industry as a whole is predominantly run by Democrats. The insurance industry is influenced by a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory environments, and consumer needs, rather than being primarily driven by political affiliation.

Answer: 0"
724,"Explanation: The claim that Medicare will be gone in eight years if nothing is done is an exaggeration. Medicare's financial status is a complex issue, but it is not expected to run out of money in just eight years. The Medicare Trustees Report for 2021 projects that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted by 2028, but this does not mean Medicare will cease to exist. The program will continue to operate, but at a reduced level of benefits. The claim is therefore false.

Answer: 0"
725,"Explanation: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of 2021, the global solar PV industry employed around 12 million people, while the oil and gas industry employed around 10 million people. However, these numbers are not directly comparable due to differences in the scope of the industries and the methods of counting jobs. The solar industry includes not only direct employment in solar PV but also in related fields like manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. The oil and gas industry includes a wide range of activities from exploration to refining and distribution. Therefore, while the solar industry has a significant number of jobs, it is not accurate to say that there are more jobs in solar than in oil.

Answer: 0"
726,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry is taking money away from hurricane victims and diverting it to remodel the Governor's Mansion is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, Governor Perry has been criticized for his handling of Hurricane Harvey, but there is no indication that he has redirected funds meant for victims to personal projects.

Answer: 0"
727,"Explanation: The claim that 50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college is not accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in the 2019-2020 academic year, about 40% of Hispanic students received Pell Grants. This percentage is lower than the 50% stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
728,"Explanation: George Allen is a former U.S. Senator from Virginia. He served in the Senate from 2001 to 2007. However, he did not run for the U.S. Senate again after his term ended. Therefore, the claim that he is running for U.S. Senate candidacy is false.

Answer: 0"
729,"Explanation: The claim that Justin Amash is rated Michigan's No. 1 conservative by National Right to Life is false. While Justin Amash is a conservative Republican and has been a vocal advocate for gun rights, there is no evidence to support the claim that he is rated Michigan's No. 1 conservative by National Right to Life. National Right to Life is a pro-life organization, and their ratings are typically based on a candidate's stance on abortion, not their overall conservatism.

Answer: 0"
730,"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The claim states that 900 people have been fired since they became Secretary, and 60 of those were for manipulating wait times. This claim is not verifiable with the information provided, as it does not specify the time period or provide any sources to back up the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the information given.

Answer: 0"
731,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is not a government takeover of healthcare. It is a law that expands access to healthcare by requiring most Americans to have health insurance, providing subsidies to help people afford coverage, and expanding Medicaid. It also includes provisions to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The law does not nationalize healthcare or replace private insurance with a government-run system.

Answer: 0"
732,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Obama wants to ""enact the single largest tax increase since the Second World War"" is false. This statement is a misinterpretation of Sen. Obama's proposed tax increases. While Sen. Obama did propose tax increases, the magnitude of these increases was not the largest since the Second World War. The claim is likely a distortion of his policies to create a negative narrative.

Answer: 0"
733,"Explanation: John McCain and George W. Bush had differing views on tax breaks for oil companies. While McCain generally supported reducing tax breaks for oil companies, Bush was more supportive of them. Therefore, the claim that both McCain and Bush favor tax breaks for oil companies is false.

Answer: 0"
734,"Explanation: The claim that 1 percent of candidates endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in 2012 won is not accurate. The NRA endorsed a significant number of candidates in 2012, and many of those candidates went on to win their respective elections. The claim of a 1 percent win rate is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual results.

Answer: 0"
735,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's polling numbers show that he is the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been is false. While Trump did receive a significant portion of the Hispanic vote in 2016, he did not achieve the highest level of support among Hispanics for any Republican presidential candidate. In fact, George W. Bush received a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote in 2004 than Trump did in 2016.

Answer: 0"
736,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have specific data on Georgia's unemployment rate for the past 50 consecutive months. However, it is important to note that unemployment rates can fluctuate significantly over time due to various economic factors. Without specific data or a reliable source to verify this claim, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the statement.

Answer: 0"
737,"Explanation: The claim is false. Georgia's State Route 400, also known as the Georgia 400, is a toll-free highway. The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) does not charge a toll for motorists to use this highway. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinformation about the highway's status.

Answer: 0"
738,"Explanation: The claim that Bruce Starr was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws and greater accountability is not accurate. While Bruce Starr was known for his advocacy for ethics reform, there were other senators who also voted for or supported similar legislation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
739,"Explanation: The claim states that the rainy day fund has increased by 226 percent since January 2011. To verify this, we need to check the historical data of the rainy day fund. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the rainy day fund, also known as the Budget Stabilization Fund, has indeed grown significantly since 2011. However, the exact percentage increase needs to be calculated based on the fund's balance in January 2011 and its current balance. Without specific data points, it's challenging to confirm the exact 226 percent increase. Therefore, the claim is not definitively true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
740,"Explanation: The claim is false. David Cicilline, who served as the mayor of Providence from 2010 to 2018, did not make the statement that the city had a world-class school system. In fact, Providence's school system has consistently ranked among the lowest in the country in terms of academic performance. According to various education reports and rankings, Providence's school system has been one of the worst-performing in the United States.

Answer: 0"
741,"Explanation: The claim that Joe Biden's release of 33 years of tax returns is more than any presidential candidate in history is false. While Biden did release more tax returns than any previous presidential candidate, the claim that it is ""more than any presidential candidate in history"" is an exaggeration. Previous candidates, such as Donald Trump, have also released extensive tax returns, but Biden's release was indeed more comprehensive.

Answer: 0"
742,"Explanation: The claim that the individual never proposed privatizing the Milwaukee County airport is false. In 2018, the individual, who was then the mayor of Milwaukee, proposed a plan to privatize the airport. This proposal was part of a broader effort to improve the airport's financial situation and increase its efficiency.

Answer: 0"
743,"Explanation: The claim is a statement about the number of veterans who will take their own lives by the end of the day. This claim is not verifiable as it is a prediction about future events and does not provide any specific source or evidence to support it. Additionally, the claim is not a fact but an assertion that is not backed by any reliable data or information.

Answer: 0"
744,"Explanation: The claim that the word ""progressive"" was created as a substitute for ""communist"" is false. The term ""progressive"" has been used in various contexts since the late 19th century, primarily to describe political and social movements that advocate for reform and change. It was not created as a direct substitute for ""communist."" The term ""communist"" has its own historical and political context, and the two terms are not interchangeable.

Answer: 0"
745,"Explanation: The claim states that ""more Georgians have jobs than at any other time since October 2008."" To verify this, we would need to look at the unemployment rate or the number of employed individuals in Georgia from October 2008 to the present. Without specific data, it is not possible to confirm the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on official statistics, it would be true if the current employment rate is higher than the rate in October 2008.

Answer: 1 (assuming the claim is based on official statistics and is true)"
746,"Explanation: The claim is false. Standard & Poor's (S&P) did not say that the United States does not have the ability to repay its debt when they downgraded the U.S. credit rating in 2011. Instead, S&P stated that the U.S. government's ability to manage its debt was impaired by political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling. The downgrade was a result of the political deadlock over raising the debt ceiling, not a statement that the U.S. cannot repay its debt.

Answer: 0"
747,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no record of the House of Representatives voting on a bill to remove country-of-origin labeling on chicken, pork, and beef sold in the U.S. The claim appears to be a misrepresentation of actual events or a fabrication.

Answer: 0"
748,"Explanation: The claim that ""The Chinese are there in Syria"" is true. China has been involved in Syria's civil war, providing military and economic support to the Syrian government. Chinese troops and military advisors have been present in Syria, and China has also been involved in reconstruction efforts in the country.

Answer: 1"
749,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Rand Paul's 2011 budget included a big cut in the CDC is false. In 2011, Sen. Paul proposed a budget that included cuts to various government programs, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was not significantly impacted. The CDC's budget remained largely unchanged, and the proposed cuts were primarily focused on other areas of the federal budget.

Answer: 0"
750,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. would gain revenue by cutting personal income tax rates in half and ending tax breaks is not accurate. Cutting personal income tax rates in half would likely reduce the amount of revenue collected from personal income taxes. Additionally, ending tax breaks would also reduce revenue, as many tax breaks are designed to encourage certain behaviors or provide relief to specific groups. Therefore, the claim that this would result in a gain in revenue is false.

Answer: 0"
751,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require taxpayers to pay for abortions. The ACA prohibits federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Virginia's recent intervention, through the passage of a law that prohibits the use of state funds for abortions, does not change the federal law. Therefore, the claim that Virginia taxpayers would have been forced to pay for abortions under Obamacare is false.

Answer: 0"
752,"Explanation: The claim states that Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika. To verify this claim, I would need to check the voting records of all candidates and compare their votes on measures related to Zika funding. Without specific information on the votes of other candidates, I cannot definitively say whether Murphy is the only one who voted against every measure to fund Zika.

Answer: 0"
753,"Explanation: The claim is true. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act was a federal law passed in 2002, but many states had implemented similar education reform initiatives before the federal law was enacted. For example, Texas had a similar law called the Texas Accountability System, which was implemented in 1994. This law aimed to improve schools by setting performance standards and providing resources for struggling schools. The claim suggests that a similar state-level law had a positive impact on schools, which aligns with the general findings of research on such initiatives.

Answer: 1"
754,"Explanation: The claim states that a certain state was the seventh highest taxed in America, including both state and local taxes. To verify this, I would need to check the most recent data from a reliable source such as the Tax Foundation or the U.S. Census Bureau. However, without specific data, I cannot confirm the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
755,"Explanation: The claim that stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters is false. The U.S. government's stimulus packages, such as the CARES Act, were designed to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no evidence to suggest that any portion of these funds was specifically allocated to purchase electric cars from Finland or as a form of political payback to Obama supporters.

Answer: 0"
756,"Explanation: The claim that Allen West called Social Security a Ponzi scheme and said this country has to get on sound footing by destroying it is false. While Allen West has been critical of Social Security and has suggested reforms, he has not explicitly called it a Ponzi scheme or advocated for its destruction. He has, however, proposed changes to the system, such as raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for higher-income individuals.

Answer: 0"
757,"Explanation: The claim that ""On eliminating the influence of money in policy campaigns"" is a broad statement that is generally true but not entirely accurate. Money does play a significant role in political campaigns, but there are also many other factors that influence policy campaigns, such as public opinion, media coverage, and grassroots support. Additionally, the elimination of money in policy campaigns is not a feasible or practical solution, as it would likely lead to other forms of influence and potentially undermine the democratic process.

Answer: 0"
758,"Explanation: Senator Jim Webb served as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate from 2007 to 2009. He was known for being a centrist Democrat and was not a reliable vote for President Obama or Senator Harry Reid. In fact, Webb was known for his independence and often voted against his party on certain issues. Therefore, the claim that Senator Webb was a reliable vote for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid is false.

Answer: 0"
759,"Explanation: The claim states that the candidate is the only one who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS). To verify this, I would need to check the official candidate list and their respective platforms or statements regarding PERS. Without this information, I cannot definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
760,"Explanation: The claim that homicides against blacks have tripled since Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law has been in existence is not accurate. While there have been some studies suggesting an increase in homicides involving black victims in Florida, the claim that this increase is tripled is an exaggeration. The ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows individuals to use deadly force if they feel threatened, has been in effect since 2005, but the overall homicide rates and the rates of homicides against blacks have not shown a tripling. The claim is misleading and not supported by reliable data.

Answer: 0"
761,"Explanation: The claim states that Pinellas County government downsized and laid off about 1,200 people in a 12 percent unemployment market, and that all of these individuals were rehired after Ms. Latvala went into office in 2000. However, there is no specific evidence or data provided to support the claim that all 1,200 laid-off individuals were rehired. The claim is vague and lacks concrete evidence to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
762,"Explanation: The claim that Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell voted for a toll lane on MoPac is false. Mayor Leffingwell was in office from 2011 to 2015, and during his tenure, there were no votes or decisions made regarding toll lanes on MoPac. The current mayor, Steve Adler, has been in office since 2016, and it is unclear if he has voted on this issue.

Answer: 0"
763,"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker will be the only economist in the U.S. House. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that the speaker is the only economist in the U.S. House. The House of Representatives typically has a diverse group of members with various backgrounds, including economists. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that the speaker will be the only economist.

Answer: 0"
764,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio Gov. John Kasich got lucky with fracking is a simplification of the complex economic factors that have contributed to Ohio's economic growth. While fracking has played a role in Ohio's economic development, it is not accurate to attribute the state's success solely to ""luck"" or to the actions of a single individual. Ohio's economic growth is the result of a combination of factors, including the state's strategic location, investments in infrastructure, education, and workforce development, as well as the state's efforts to attract and retain businesses.

Answer: 0"
765,"Explanation: The claim states that the Associated Press (AP) called Charlie Crist's attacks ""over the top,"" ""out of context,"" and ""not true."" However, there is no evidence or source provided to support this claim. The Associated Press is a reputable news agency, but it is not known for making such direct evaluations of political statements. Therefore, without a credible source or context, it is not possible to verify the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
766,"Explanation: The claim that 7,000 millionaires gamed the system to pay no income taxes is a generalization and lacks specific evidence. While it is true that some wealthy individuals may use legal tax avoidance strategies, such as exploiting loopholes in tax laws, it is not accurate to say that 7,000 millionaires have done so. The number 7,000 is not supported by any credible source, and the claim is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
767,"Explanation: Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. He spent his early childhood in Indonesia and Hawaii, and his father was from Kenya, but he did not grow up in Kenya. The claim that he grew up in Kenya is false.

Answer: 0"
768,"Explanation: The claim that 90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted is a misrepresentation of the facts. While it is true that the abortion rate for pregnancies with Down syndrome is higher than the general population, the 90 percent figure is an exaggeration. Studies have shown that the abortion rate for pregnancies with Down syndrome is around 60-70 percent, not 90 percent. This claim is often used to argue against abortion rights, but it is important to present accurate information.

Answer: 0"
769,"Explanation: The claim that Steve Jobs was responsible for creating more jobs than the stimulus bill is not accurate. While Steve Jobs was a significant figure in the tech industry and his companies, Apple and Pixar, have created many jobs, the stimulus bill, which was a government initiative to stimulate the economy during the 2008 financial crisis, created a much larger number of jobs. The stimulus bill was designed to provide immediate relief to the economy and create jobs in various sectors, including construction, education, and healthcare. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
770,"Explanation: The claim that you cannot destroy guns purchased in a buyback program is false. In many gun buyback programs, the guns are indeed destroyed after being collected. The goal of these programs is to reduce the number of firearms in circulation, and one way to achieve this is by physically destroying the guns. Memphis, like many other cities, has implemented such programs, and the guns collected are typically melted down or otherwise rendered unusable.

Answer: 0"
771,"Explanation: The claim that taxpayers pay for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin and 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee is misleading. While it is true that Medicaid, a government-funded health insurance program, covers a significant portion of births in Wisconsin, the claim that taxpayers pay for 45% of all births and 60% of births in Milwaukee is an overstatement. Medicaid covers births for low-income individuals, but it does not cover all births in Wisconsin or Milwaukee. The claim also does not specify that it is referring to Medicaid coverage, which could lead to confusion.

Answer: 0"
772,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not bar the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs) to pay for non-prescription health needs such as aspirin. In fact, the ACA allows for the use of FSAs and HSAs to pay for a wide range of health expenses, including over-the-counter medications, with a prescription from a healthcare provider. This change was made to simplify the use of these accounts and to encourage preventive care.

Answer: 0"
773,"Explanation: Patrick Murphy, a former U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, has indeed passed several bills out of committee during his time in Congress. For example, he was a co-sponsor of the ""Veterans' Access, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2015,"" which passed the House of Representatives. Therefore, the claim that he has not passed a single bill out of committee is false.

Answer: 0"
774,"Explanation: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin lost 10,000 jobs over the past 12 months, while California lost 1,000,000 jobs. Therefore, Wisconsin did not lose more jobs than any other state over the past 12 months.

Answer: 0"
775,"Explanation: The claim that ""no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State"" is false. New York State has banned hydraulic fracturing (fracking) since 2014, but the state has experienced issues with waste from fracking operations in other states being transported and disposed of in New York. For instance, in 2019, a waste disposal company was fined for improperly disposing of fracking waste in New York. Therefore, the claim that no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
776,"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplified comparison of tax rates without considering the progressive nature of the tax system. In the United States, for example, the tax rate increases as income increases, but the effective tax rate (the total tax paid as a percentage of income) for higher earners is not necessarily four times that of lower earners. This is because higher earners often have more deductions, credits, and other tax advantages that reduce their effective tax rate. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
777,"Explanation: The claim is false. Secretary of State John Kerry did not support Hamas to the exclusion of the Arab League. In fact, Kerry's visit to Paris and his meeting with Hamas representatives were part of broader efforts to engage with various stakeholders in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including Hamas, to promote peace and stability. The criticism he faced was more about the timing and method of his engagement with Hamas, rather than his support for them to the exclusion of other parties.

Answer: 0"
778,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Senate typically passes a budget annually, and there is no evidence to suggest that it has been four and a half years since the last budget was passed. The most recent budget passed by the Senate was in 2021.

Answer: 0"
779,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific interpretation of the Republicans' alternative health care plan, which is a complex and evolving policy proposal. The statement that insurers will be able to raise premiums four times faster than wages is a simplification and may not accurately reflect the nuances of the plan. The actual impact on premiums and wages would depend on various factors, including the specific provisions of the plan and how they are implemented. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false without more detailed information.

Answer: 0"
780,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by Hart and Risley (1995) which found that children from low-income families hear about 30 million fewer words than children from well-off families by the time they are 3 years old. This study has been widely cited and is considered a significant piece of research in the field of child development. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
781,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin had the lowest unemployment rate in the country for 40 consecutive months under the governorship of Scott Walker is false. While Wisconsin did have a low unemployment rate during Walker's tenure, it was not the lowest in the country for 40 consecutive months. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
782,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of Floridians who are able to vote is not 13,000, and the governor's office has not withheld this information. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of a specific voting issue or statistic.

Answer: 0"
783,"Explanation: The claim is based on an analysis by independent experts, which suggests that Donald Trump's tax plan would increase the national debt by over $5 trillion and could disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy. This claim is supported by various economic analyses and reports from independent think tanks and economists. For instance, the Tax Policy Center and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget have both published analyses indicating that Trump's tax plan would lead to significant increases in the national debt and could disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

Answer: 1"
784,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats do not have a plan for extending the Bush tax cuts is false. In fact, Democrats have proposed various plans to extend or modify the Bush tax cuts, often as part of broader tax reform discussions. For instance, during the Obama administration, there were proposals to extend certain tax cuts for middle-class Americans while allowing others to expire. Additionally, in recent years, there have been discussions and proposals from Democratic lawmakers regarding tax policy, including extensions or modifications of the Bush tax cuts.

Answer: 0"
785,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government is the largest energy user in the country is false. While the federal government does consume a significant amount of energy, it is not the largest energy user in the country. The largest energy users are typically large corporations, such as those in the manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture sectors. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that in 2020, the residential sector was the largest energy consumer, followed by the commercial sector, and then the industrial sector, which includes large corporations. The federal government's energy consumption is a significant portion of the total, but it is not the largest.

Answer: 0"
786,"Explanation: The claim is based on statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. According to the CDC, about 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men in the United States have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime. These statistics are widely accepted and cited in various studies and reports.

Answer: 1"
787,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution does not have a residency requirement for presidential candidates. The only requirement is that a candidate must be a natural-born citizen of the United States and at least 35 years old. The residency of the candidates does not affect their eligibility to run for the presidency.

Answer: 0"
788,"Explanation: The claim that ""one out of every three students currently today is ready for college before they go there"" is not supported by any reliable data or studies.

789,"Explanation: The claim that today's marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear is an exaggeration. While it is true that the potency of marijuana has increased over time, the claim of a 300 percent to 800 percent increase is not supported by scientific evidence. The potency of marijuana is typically measured in terms of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content, and while modern strains may have higher THC content than older strains, the increase is generally in the range of 10-20 percent, not 300-800 percent.

Answer: 0"
790,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the spending of the Democrats in one month to the spending of President Bush over seven years on the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, and Hurricane Katrina. This comparison is misleading because it does not account for the different time frames and the nature of the spending. The spending by the Democrats in one month is likely a fraction of the total spending by President Bush over seven years. Additionally, the spending by the Democrats is likely for different purposes and may not be directly comparable to the spending on wars and natural disasters.

Therefore, the claim that Wisconsin is below the national average in wage growth and job growth is true.

Answer: 1"
793,"Explanation: The claim suggests that people who are unemployed and give up looking for jobs are suddenly considered employed, which is not accurate. Unemployment rates are calculated based on people who are actively seeking work. If someone stops looking for work, they are no longer considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate. Therefore, the claim is misleading and false.

Answer: 0"
794,"Explanation: The claim states that of the 25 wealthiest nations, the United States is the only one that doesn't provide basic health coverage. This is a false statement. While it is true that the United States does not have a universal healthcare system like many other developed countries, it is not accurate to say that it is the only wealthy nation without such a system. For example, some wealthy nations like Switzerland and Singapore have healthcare systems that are not fully universal but still provide significant coverage.

795,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney supported a law that could have made most common forms of birth control illegal is false. During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney did support a law that would have allowed states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, but this law did not make most common forms of birth control illegal. Instead, it would have allowed employers to refuse to cover contraception if it went against their religious beliefs. The claim is misleading and exaggerates Romney's position.

Answer: 0"
796,"Explanation: The claim that the most significant driver of out-migration from Rhode Island is the estate tax is not accurate. While estate taxes can be a factor in some cases, they are not the primary driver of out-migration. Other significant factors include economic opportunities, cost of living, and quality of life. Additionally, Rhode Island's estate tax is not particularly high compared to other states, and it does not apply to all estates. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
797,"Explanation: The claim about Scott Walker's school-aid cuts being so devastating that students are without chairs and a government survey found 47 kids in a classroom is false. While Scott Walker, as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, did implement budget cuts that affected schools, there is no evidence to support the specific claims made in the statement. The claim about students being without chairs and the government survey finding 47 kids in a classroom are not supported by credible sources.

803,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not released any new estimates that conclude the final price-tag for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will exceed $2 trillion more than double what was initially reported.

804,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in 2019, the top 1% of Americans paid 40.1% of the income taxes, while the bottom 50% paid 3.1%. The claim that 5% of Americans pay over half the income taxes is incorrect. Additionally, the claim that 40% of Americans pay no income taxes is also incorrect. The IRS data shows that in 2019, 44.5% of Americans did not pay any income tax, but this is due to various factors such as income below the taxable threshold, tax credits, and deductions.

807,"Explanation: The claim states that Connecticut takes on slot machines at a rate of 25 cents on the dollar and that the state takes on table games at a rate of zero. This claim is false. In Connecticut, the tax rate for slot machines is 25%, not 25 cents on the dollar. Additionally, the state does take a percentage of table game revenue, but it is not zero. The correct tax rates are 25% for slot machines and 10% for table games.

While it is true that the Obama administration used the Espionage Act more frequently than previous administrations, the claim that it was more than all previous administrations combined is an exaggeration. The Espionage Act was used to prosecute several individuals who leaked information to journalists, but the claim that it was used more than all previous administrations combined is not supported by historical data.

Answer: 0"
812,"Explanation: The claim that Nevada has been recently ranked No. 1 in unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy, and divorce is false. While Nevada has faced significant economic challenges in recent years, it has not been ranked No. 1 in all these categories. For instance, Nevada has had high unemployment rates, but it has not been ranked No. 1 in unemployment. Similarly, while Nevada has had high foreclosure rates, it has not been ranked No. 1 in foreclosures. The same applies to violent crime, personal bankruptcy, and divorce rates. These rankings are often based on national surveys and reports, and Nevada's rankings in these categories are not consistently at the top.

Answer: 1"
817,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the annual deaths from tobacco to the total deaths from World War II, AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide, and suicide combined. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tobacco use is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States. The total deaths from World War II in the U.S. were approximately 400,000. The combined deaths from AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide, and suicide are significantly lower than the deaths from tobacco. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
818,"Explanation: Bernie Sanders did not win Nevada. The Nevada Democratic Caucus results showed that Joe Biden won the state with 50.0% of the vote, while Bernie Sanders received 35.0% of the vote. Therefore, the claim that Bernie Sanders won Nevada after all is false.

Answer: 0"
819,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump is going to ""carpet bomb"" the Middle East is false. Carpet bombing is a military strategy that involves dropping a large number of bombs over a wide area, often resulting in significant civilian casualties. This strategy is widely condemned due to its indiscriminate nature and the high risk of civilian casualties. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible evidence or official statement from Donald Trump or his administration indicating that he plans to use carpet bombing in the Middle East. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of his policies or statements.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
821,"Explanation: The claim is about the allocation of funds in the United States, specifically mentioning pork barrel projects and earmark projects. Pork barrel projects are a form of political corruption where government funds are allocated to benefit specific individuals or groups, often in exchange for political support. Earmark projects are specific projects or programs that are funded by the government. The claim suggests that $20 billion was spent on these projects and that some of this money could have been used for bridge inspections instead. However, the claim does not provide any specific sources or evidence to support the $20 billion figure or the suggestion that the money could have been used differently. Therefore, without concrete evidence or sources, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
826,"Explanation: The claim that 25 percent of physicians in Rhode Island are graduates of for-profit medical schools is not supported by any reliable data sources. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the percentage of physicians graduating from for-profit medical schools is generally low and varies by state. As of the latest data, the percentage of physicians from for-profit medical schools is typically less than 10% nationwide, and specific state data is not readily available to support the claim for Rhode Island.

Answer: 0"
827,"Explanation: The claim that Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years is not accurate. Medicare's financial status is a complex issue, but it is not expected to become insolvent in the near future. The Medicare Trustees Report, released annually, provides projections about Medicare's financial status. According to the 2021 report, Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is expected to be depleted in 2026, but this does not mean Medicare will be bankrupt. The program will continue to operate, but at a reduced level of benefits. Additionally, the report also notes that the Medicare program is expected to remain solvent through 2030 if certain changes are made to the program.

Answer: 0"
828,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn laws passed by Congress, and it has done so in the past. For example, in 1954, the Supreme Court struck down the ""separate but equal"" doctrine in Brown v. Board of Education, which was a significant majority decision by Congress. Therefore, the claim that it would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step is not accurate.

Answer: 1"
829,"Explanation: The claim is about the opposition to a specific war, which is the Iraq War. The Iraq War began in 2003 and lasted until 2011. The claim states that the person opposed the war in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. However, the war did not start until 2003, and the person's opposition to the war would have been relevant from 2003 onwards. Therefore, the claim that the person opposed the war in 2002 is false.

Answer: 0"
830,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. State Department did not spend $630,000 to get 2 million Facebook Likes. The State Department has used social media to promote its messages, but the specific claim about spending $630,000 for Facebook Likes is not accurate.

838,"Explanation: The claim that jobs involving the minimum wage are overwhelmingly for young people starting out in the workforce is not entirely accurate. While it is true that many entry-level jobs, which often pay minimum wage, are held by young people, there are also many adults and even older workers who hold these jobs. These jobs can include retail, food service, and other service industries. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"

840,"Explanation: The claim that the City of Milwaukee uses the building inspection area as a revenue base is false.

Answer: 0"
841,"Explanation: The claim suggests that by simply inflating tires and getting regular tune-ups, we could save all the oil that is being discussed in the context of drilling. This claim is misleading because while proper tire inflation and regular tune-ups can help improve fuel efficiency and reduce oil consumption, they are not a significant enough factor to save all the oil that is being discussed in the context of drilling. Drilling for oil is a complex process that involves significant energy and resource inputs, and the amount of oil that can be saved through tire inflation and tune-ups is minimal compared to the total oil consumption and drilling activities.

Answer: 0"
842,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit organization that tracks abortion policy, there have been 555 abortion restrictions enacted in the United States since 2019.

- **Afghanistan**: The claim that Obama boosted the effort in Afghanistan is also true. Obama increased troop levels in Afghanistan after taking office, and the U.S. military presence there was significant during his presidency.
- **Guantanamo**: The claim that Obama did not close Guantanamo is false. While he did not close the detention facility during his presidency, he did attempt to close it and transferred many detainees to other facilities. The closure was blocked by Congress.

848,"Explanation: The claim that ""Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law"" is a generalization that is not supported by specific data or evidence. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was signed into law in 2010, and while it has had various impacts on the economy and healthcare, it is not accurate to say that businesses have created jobs every single month since its implementation. Job creation can vary significantly from month to month due to numerous factors, and it is not accurate to attribute all job creation to a single piece of legislation.

Answer: 0"
849,"Explanation: The claim that MSNBC went off the air for behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with the revelation that Michael Brown was a suspect in a robbery is false.

850,"Explanation: The claim states that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted 8% unemployment until 2014. However, the CBO's official reports and projections do not support this claim. The CBO's unemployment rate projections for 2014 were significantly lower than 8%. For instance, in their January 2014 report, the CBO projected the unemployment rate to be around 6.7% in 2014. Therefore, the claim is false.

These funds are typically used to purchase food, equipment, and supplies for school cafeterias.

These rates are significantly lower than the claimed 61%.

Answer: 0"
857,"Explanation: The claim that every time taxes have been cut, revenues have gone up and the economy has grown is a simplification of complex economic phenomena. While tax cuts can stimulate economic growth in the short term, they can also lead to reduced government revenue, which can negatively impact public services and infrastructure. Additionally, the impact of tax cuts on revenue and economic growth can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances, such as the size of the tax cut, the economic conditions at the time, and the composition of the tax base. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time taxes have been cut, revenues have gone up and the economy has grown.

860,"Explanation: The Pell Bridge, also known as the Pell Island Bridge, is a bridge that connects the mainland to Pell Island in Maine, USA. It is primarily used for commuter traffic, as it is a vital link for residents of the island and the mainland.

Therefore, the claim that the Pell Bridge is essentially a tourism bridge and not a commuter bridge is false.

However, these benefits cannot be used to purchase cash or non-food items like marijuana. Additionally, there is no provision for using ATMs to withdraw cash specifically for marijuana purchases.

Answer: 0"
862,"Explanation: The claim that Republicans stood on the sidelines when Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid were created is false. In fact, many key figures in the creation of these programs were Republicans. For example, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, proposed Social Security in 1935, but it was Republicans who played a significant role in its passage through Congress. Similarly, Medicare was created under President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, but the legislation was supported by a bipartisan coalition in Congress, including many Republicans. Medicaid was created under President Richard Nixon, a Republican, and was supported by a bipartisan coalition in Congress.

Answer: 1"
864,"Explanation: The claim that violent crime is lower in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is a topic of ongoing debate and research. Studies on the relationship between gun laws and crime rates have produced mixed results. Some studies suggest that states with more permissive gun laws have higher rates of violent crime, while others find no significant correlation or even a slight decrease in crime rates. The claim is not universally accepted and is subject to interpretation based on the specific studies and methodologies used.

866,"Explanation: The claim that a nation is the ""most highly taxed"" can be subjective and depends on the specific taxes being considered (e.g., income tax, sales tax, property tax, etc.). However, as of my last update in October 2023, the country with the highest overall tax burden is typically considered to be Sweden. Sweden has a high tax rate, with a top income tax rate of around 57.5% and a comprehensive tax-to-GDP ratio of approximately 45%. Therefore, the claim that a nation is the ""most highly taxed"" is generally true when referring to Sweden.

Answer: 1"
867,"Explanation: The claim is false. The total value of platinum in the world is significantly less than the U.S. national debt. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt was approximately $28 trillion, while the total value of platinum in the world is estimated to be around $100 billion. Therefore, even if you took every ounce of platinum in the world, it would not be enough to pay down the U.S. national debt.

Answer: 0"
868,"Explanation: The claim is false. In Oregon, minors under the age of 18 cannot consent to sterilization without parental consent. The Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) 40.700.010 states that a minor cannot consent to sterilization without the consent of a parent or guardian. Therefore, the claim that girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
869,"Explanation: The ""Fast and Furious"" operation, also known as Operation Wide Receiver, was a controversial law enforcement program that began in 2009 under the Obama administration. The program was designed to track the flow of weapons from the United States to Mexican drug cartels. The claim that it started in the Bush administration is false.

Answer: 0"
870,"Explanation: The claim that tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan is false. The U.S. government does not have a specific plan for a zombie apocalypse. While there are contingency plans for various emergencies, including natural disasters and public health crises, there is no evidence to suggest that the government has allocated resources specifically for a zombie apocalypse scenario. This claim is a humorous or satirical exaggeration, not a factual statement.

Answer: 0"
871,"Explanation: Rob Portman, a former U.S. Senator and current U.S. Trade Representative, has been criticized for his role in trade policies that some argue have led to job losses in the Mahoning Valley and other regions. However, the claim that he ""sucked the jobs out of the Mahoning Valley and sent them to China"" is an oversimplification and lacks specific evidence. While Portman's policies may have contributed to job losses, it is not accurate to attribute all of these losses solely to him. The claim also ignores the complex interplay of global economic factors, technological advancements, and other domestic policies that have influenced job markets.

Answer: 0"
872,"Explanation: The claim that actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson wore a T-shirt stating ""We Stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen"" is false. There is no evidence or verified reports to support this claim. The Rock has been known to express his views on social issues, but this specific statement has not been attributed to him.

Answer: 0"
873,"Explanation: The claim that ending federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) would jeopardize 9,000 jobs is based on a 2019 report by the NPR that stated that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if federal funding were to be eliminated. However, this report was a projection and not a guarantee. The actual impact on jobs would depend on various factors, including the ability of NPR to secure alternative funding sources and the specific circumstances of the job market. Therefore, while the claim is based on a real report, it is not necessarily accurate to say that 9,000 jobs would be jeopardized.

Answer: 0"
874,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Florida Insurance Commissioner, David Altman, has been actively involved in negotiating lower rates and advocating for consumers under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). He has been critical of the federal government's handling of the healthcare law and has worked to ensure that Floridians have access to affordable healthcare options. Therefore, the claim that Florida refused to allow the insurance commissioner to negotiate lower rates or refuse rates that are too high is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
875,"Explanation: Rick Scott, a former Governor of Florida, has not publicly stated that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs. The Department of Community Affairs is a state agency in Florida responsible for community development, housing, and other related issues. There is no credible source or statement from Rick Scott indicating that he intends to eliminate this department.

Answer: 0"
876,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia's CRCT (Criterion-Referenced Competency Test) sets some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation is not accurate. The CRCT is a standardized test used in Georgia to measure student achievement in various subjects. While the specific proficiency levels and expectations may vary, it is not accurate to say that Georgia has the lowest expectations in the nation. The expectations and proficiency levels are set by the Georgia Department of Education and are based on state standards, which are comparable to those in other states.

Answer: 0"
877,"Explanation: The claim that ""He's been endorsed by 'every major newspaper here in the state of Texas'"" is highly unlikely to be true. Endorsements from ""every major newspaper"" would be a significant achievement and would typically be widely reported and verified. However, there is no evidence provided to support this claim, and it is not a common occurrence for a single individual to receive endorsements from every major newspaper in a large state like Texas.

Answer: 0"
878,"Explanation: As of the latest data available, the House of Representatives does not have a majority of prochoice members. The majority of the House is composed of Republicans, who are generally more conservative on social issues, including abortion. While there are prochoice members in the House, they do not constitute a majority.

Answer: 0"
879,"Explanation: The claim states that ""a record four out of every 10 school kids in Ohio now qualifies for subsidized lunch."" This claim is based on a specific statistic about the number of students eligible for subsidized lunch programs. To verify the claim, I would need to check the latest data from reliable sources such as the Ohio Department of Education or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which manages the National School Lunch Program. Without this specific data, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
880,"Explanation: Florida is not the largest dog-racing state in the country. The largest dog-racing state is actually West Virginia, which has a long history of dog racing and hosts the annual West Virginia State Fair, which includes dog racing events. Florida does have dog racing, but it is not the largest in the country.

Answer: 0"
881,"Explanation: The claim ""We cut our deficits by more than half"" is vague and does not specify the time period or the context in which the deficit was cut. Without specific details, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, it cannot be determined if the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
882,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies emit unlimited carbon pollution into our air is false. Sen. Johnson has voted against several bills that would have increased regulations on carbon emissions, but he has not voted to allow unlimited carbon pollution. He has also supported measures to address climate change, such as investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Answer: 0"
883,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard, the graduation rates for the universities listed are as follows:
- Rutgers University: 60.5%
- Kean University: 33.3%
- Montclair State University: 50.1%
- New Jersey City University: 27.3%
- Stockton College: 27.3%
- Rowan University: 51.3%
- William Paterson University: 55.1%

Only Montclair State University and William Paterson University have graduation rates above 50% within four years. Therefore, the claim that all of these universities graduate less than 50% of their students within four years is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
884,"Explanation: The claim that a change in law carried out by the speaker stopped a $100 million tax increase in the Dallas school district is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess the truth of this claim, one would need to consult official records, statements from the Dallas school district, or other reliable sources that can confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0"
885,"Explanation: The claim ""Jeff Greene on why he went to Cuba"" is incomplete and lacks context. Without additional information about who Jeff Greene is and the specific reason for his visit to Cuba, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
886,"Explanation: The claim that the average public school teacher in Wisconsin makes $89,000 a year in salary and benefits is false. According to the National Education Association, the average salary for public school teachers in Wisconsin in the 2020-2021 school year was approximately $61,000. Benefits can add to this amount, but the total compensation is still significantly lower than the claimed $89,000.

Answer: 0"
887,"Explanation: The claim is true. The U.S. Mint has reported that the cost to produce a one-cent coin is more than a penny, and the cost to produce a five-cent coin is more than a nickel. This is due to the increasing cost of materials and the complexity of the minting process.

Answer: 1"
888,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he never voted for a tax increase"" is a statement about a person's voting record. To evaluate its truthfulness, we would need to verify the person's voting history. Without specific information about the person's voting record, we cannot definitively determine if the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
889,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Scott's sale of the state planes was not proper is a complex issue that depends on the specific circumstances and legal interpretations. Without detailed information about the sale, such as the process followed, the reasons for the sale, and any legal challenges or investigations, it is difficult to definitively determine the validity of the claim. However, if there are specific allegations of impropriety, such as conflicts of interest, lack of transparency, or violations of state procurement laws, then the claim could be true.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be definitively judged as true without more information.)"
890,"Explanation: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is ""job killing"" is a complex issue that has been debated extensively. Some studies suggest that the ACA may have led to a reduction in full-time employment, particularly among low-wage workers, due to the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees. However, other studies and analyses have shown that the overall impact on employment is minimal or even positive, with the ACA providing access to health insurance for millions of Americans who previously did not have it. Therefore, the claim that the ACA is ""job killing"" is not universally accepted and is subject to interpretation based on the specific data and studies one chooses to consider.

Answer: 0"
891,"Explanation: The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly prohibit someone from running for Congress simultaneously in multiple states. The Constitution does not address the issue of dual candidacies, leaving it to state laws and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to regulate such situations. However, the FEC has rules that can affect dual candidacies, such as the requirement to file a Statement of Candidacy in each state where one is running. Therefore, while the Constitution does not prevent it, practical and regulatory considerations may make it difficult or impossible to run for Congress in multiple states simultaneously.

Answer: 1"
892,"Explanation: The claim that Betty Sutton voted to destroy Medicare in 2010 is false. Betty Sutton was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio's 16th district from 2005 to 2013. She was a Democrat and did not vote to destroy Medicare. In fact, she was a strong supporter of Medicare and voted against any legislation that would have significantly weakened or dismantled the program.

Answer: 0"
893,"Explanation: The fiscal cliff agreement, which was reached in early 2013, included a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. While it did result in significant tax increases, it is not accurate to say that it was the largest tax increase in history. The fiscal cliff agreement was part of a broader package of measures aimed at addressing the U.S. budget deficit, and while it was a substantial increase, it was not unprecedented in terms of magnitude compared to other major tax increases in U.S. history.

Answer: 0"
894,"Explanation: The claim ""On the mosque near ground zero"" is false. The World Trade Center and the surrounding area, including the mosque, were not affected by the 9/11 attacks. The mosque, known as the World Trade Center Mosque, is located in the same area but was not damaged during the attacks. The claim is a misinterpretation of the location and the events.

Answer: 0"
895,"Explanation: Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. During his presidency, he was heavily involved in national security affairs, including decisions on military operations, intelligence, and foreign policy. He also served as a member of the Illinois State Senate and as a U.S. Senator before his presidency, where he gained experience in policy-making and legislative processes. Therefore, the claim that Obama ""has no experience or background at all in national security affairs"" is false.

Answer: 0"
896,"Explanation: The claim that White House spokesman Robert Gibbs lied when he said President Obama's birth certificate is posted on the Internet is false. In 2011, President Obama released his long-form birth certificate to address persistent rumors about his citizenship. This was done through the White House website, and the document was verified by the Hawaii Department of Health. Therefore, Gibbs' statement was accurate, and the claim that he lied is false.

Answer: 0"
897,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes a provision for end-of-life counseling, but it is entirely voluntary. The provision, known as the ""Five Questions"" or ""Five Wishes,"" is designed to help patients discuss their end-of-life preferences with their healthcare providers. However, patients are not required to participate in this counseling, and it is not a mandatory part of the healthcare reform bill.

Answer: 0"
898,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by John McCain's top lobbyist, Tony Blankley, during the 2000 presidential campaign. Blankley did indeed say, ""The American people won't care about this,"" when asked about the hiring of lobbyists for McCain's campaign. This statement was reported in various news outlets at the time, including The Washington Post and The New York Times. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
899,"Explanation: The claim that ""Three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the U.S. for asthma"" is not verifiable without specific data or sources. To accurately judge the claim, one would need to refer to reliable sources such as the American Lung Association's State of the Air report or similar health studies that rank cities based on asthma rates. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
900,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""For every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion"" is a misrepresentation of the actual data. According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2017, 34% of women who visited Planned Parenthood health centers for abortion services received an abortion. This means that the majority of women who visit Planned Parenthood for abortion services do not receive an abortion, and the claim that 32 out of 33 women receive an abortion is a significant exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
901,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Virginia Department of Health spends approximately $100,000 on abstinence education programs, not $400,000. Additionally, the claim that Virginia lost $2.5 million in federal funds due to Gov. Bob McDonnells' political agenda is not supported by any credible sources. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the facts.

Answer: 0"
902,"Explanation: The claim that the Democratic Party created the Ku Klux Klan is false. The Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1865 by a group of former Confederate soldiers in Pulaski, Tennessee. The Democratic Party did not create the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan's initial purpose was to intimidate and terrorize newly freed slaves and their supporters, and it was later revived in the 1910s and 1920s with a focus on anti-immigration and anti-Catholic sentiments. The Democratic Party has a history of supporting civil rights and has been opposed to the Ku Klux Klan.

Answer: 0"
903,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump mocked someone with a disability is based on a specific incident that occurred during his 2016 presidential campaign. In a 2016 rally, Trump was seen mimicking a reporter with a disability, which was widely criticized as ableist and disrespectful. This incident was widely reported and verified by multiple news outlets.

Answer: 1"
904,"Explanation: The claim states that the state auditor found that 37 percent of the 428,000 students receiving free and reduced-price lunches are ineligible. This claim is false because it is not possible for 37 percent of the students to be ineligible if they are already receiving free or reduced-price lunches. The percentage of ineligible students should be less than 100 percent, and the claim suggests that a significant portion of the students are receiving the wrong type of assistance.

Answer: 0"
905,"Explanation: President Obama did not campaign on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan. While he did support and sign into law the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which included provisions for reproductive health care, this was not the primary focus of his campaign. His campaign platform emphasized issues like healthcare reform, economic recovery, and ending the Iraq War.

Answer: 0"
906,"Explanation: The claim is false. The House of Representatives has indeed sued a sitting president in U.S. history. In 1998, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Bill Clinton, accusing him of perjury and obstruction of justice. Although he was acquitted by the Senate, this is a clear example of the House suing a sitting president.

Answer: 0"
907,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the Texas Department of Agriculture, the top five counties in Texas by cattle inventory are: 1. Tom Green County, 2. Bexar County, 3. Nueces County, 4. Travis County, and 5. San Saba County. These counties account for approximately 89% of the cattle inventory in Texas.

Answer: 1"
908,"Explanation: The claim that Kasich's trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs, specifically 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China, is not accurate. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of trade data. Trade deals can lead to job losses in certain sectors, but they also create new jobs in other sectors. The specific numbers provided are not supported by reliable sources or economic data. The claim is misleading and not based on factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
909,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Jon Corzine, a former Senator, was subpoenaed to testify before the Senate, it is not the first time in history that a former Senator has been subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues. There have been numerous instances of former Senators being called to testify before the Senate in the past.

Answer: 0"
910,"Explanation: The claim that the person never supported the federal health care individual mandate is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes an individual mandate that requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. The person in question, Donald Trump, has publicly stated his opposition to the ACA and the individual mandate, but he did not support the mandate when it was first implemented.

Answer: 0"
911,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of data from a study by the Federal Reserve. The study found that the top 400 wealthiest Americans have more wealth than the bottom 50% of Americans combined. However, this does not mean that the top 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans. The bottom 50% includes the top 400 Americans, so the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
912,"Explanation: The claim that Florida had five sanctuary cities while Jeb Bush was governor is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no official record or widely accepted information that supports the claim that Florida had five sanctuary cities during Jeb Bush's tenure as governor. Sanctuary cities are typically defined as cities that have policies in place to limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, and the number of such cities in Florida has been a subject of debate and misinformation.

Answer: 0"
913,"Explanation: The claim about the timing of the announcement for the president is vague and does not provide specific details or context. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
914,"Explanation: The claim is true. Pell Grants were first introduced in 1972, and by 1976, they were fully funded. In 1976, a full Pell Grant covered 72% of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college. Over the years, the purchasing power of Pell Grants has decreased due to inflation and changes in the cost of attendance. In the 2021-2022 academic year, a full Pell Grant covered 34% of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college.

Answer: 1"
915,"Explanation: The claim that 17 intelligence agencies have concluded that cyberattacks on U.S. elections come from the highest levels of the Kremlin is a complex issue. While it is true that multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed cyberattacks to Russian actors, including those linked to the Russian government, the claim that these attacks are ""designed to influence our election"" is more nuanced. The intelligence community has reported that Russian actors interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but the extent to which these actions were specifically designed to influence the election rather than other activities is a matter of ongoing debate and investigation.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or misleading as it simplifies and generalizes the intelligence community's findings.)"
916,"Explanation: The claim about Andrew Cuomo creating 500 jobs at a cost of $1.5 million per job in the SolarCity project is misleading and likely false. The SolarCity project in Buffalo, which was announced in 2017, was intended to create 3,000 jobs, not 500. Additionally, the cost per job figure of $1.5 million is not accurate and seems to be an exaggeration. The actual cost per job for such projects is typically much lower.

Answer: 0"
917,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence that former President Barack Obama made this statement. The claim appears to be a misattribution of a statement made by another politician or a fabrication. Additionally, the claim is not supported by any official records or statements from the Obama administration.

Answer: 0"
918,"Explanation: The claim is based on data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which reports that 30.4% of Texas college students graduate within four years and 58.1% graduate within six years. The claim is slightly inaccurate as it rounds down the percentages, but the overall statement is true.

Answer: 1"
919,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney told university students in Ohio to borrow money from their parents to start a business is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim. Mitt Romney has not made such a statement publicly.

Answer: 0"
920,"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, Nancy Pelosi, and Al Gore are all prominent political figures in the United States, but they have not collaborated on global warming. Newt Gingrich is known for his skepticism about climate change, while Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore are both prominent advocates for addressing global warming. Therefore, the claim that they have teamed up on global warming is false.

Answer: 0"
921,"Explanation: The claim that the Senate immigration bill would result in a population increase of over 70 million people in 20 years is an exaggeration and not supported by the actual provisions of the bill. The Senate immigration bill, known as the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, aims to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the U.S., increase the number of refugees admitted, and reform the visa system. While it does increase the number of immigrants, the projected population increase is not as dramatic as the claim suggests. Estimates from various sources, including the Migration Policy Institute, suggest that the bill would increase the U.S. population by several million over the next 20 years, but not by 70 million.

Answer: 0"
922,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama ""shunned the opportunity to talk to soldiers to thank them for their service"" is false. In fact, President Obama made several visits to military bases and troops during his presidency to express his gratitude and support. For example, he visited troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations to thank them for their service and to discuss the ongoing operations. These visits were widely reported in the media and are documented in historical records.

Answer: 0"
923,"Explanation: The claim that there are pipes carrying natural gas in this country made of wood is false. Natural gas pipelines are typically made of materials like steel, plastic, or composite materials, not wood. Wood is not suitable for this purpose due to its susceptibility to rot, insects, and other environmental factors that could compromise the integrity of the pipeline.

Answer: 0"
924,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney says ""class sizes don't matter"" is false. Mitt Romney has publicly stated that class size does matter and that reducing class sizes can improve educational outcomes. For example, in a 2012 presidential debate, Romney mentioned that reducing class sizes can help teachers provide better instruction. Therefore, the claim is a misrepresentation of Romney's actual stance on the issue.

Answer: 0"
925,"Explanation: The claim is referring to Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator and former presidential candidate. The statement suggests that Cruz's TV ad about John Kasich was a lie and that stations had to pull it off the air. However, there is no specific evidence provided to support this claim, and it is not widely reported that such an incident occurred. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
926,"Explanation: The claim that ""My office sends federal money back every year"" is false. Federal money, such as tax refunds, is typically sent to individuals or businesses based on their tax returns and is not something that an office would ""send back"" annually. The process involves the IRS calculating the amount of tax owed or refundable and then sending the appropriate amount to the taxpayer.

Answer: 0"
927,"Explanation: The claim states that there are over 25 million people living in Texas and less than 2 percent of them have concealed handgun licenses. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, as of 2021, there are approximately 25.1 million people living in Texas. The Texas Department of Public Safety also reports that as of 2021, there are about 1.6 million active concealed handgun licenses in Texas. To verify the claim, we can calculate the percentage of people with concealed handgun licenses:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of concealed handgun licenses}}{\text{Total population}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1,600,000}{25,100,000} \right) \times 100 \approx 6.37\% \]

Since 6.37% is greater than 2%, the claim that less than 2 percent of Texans have concealed handgun licenses is false.

Answer: 0"
928,"Explanation: The claim is based on a report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) which estimated that reducing pay and benefits for federal employees could save $103 billion over 10 years. However, this figure is not a direct savings but rather a projection based on various scenarios and assumptions. Additionally, the claim that this would amount to more than $50,000 per worker is misleading as it does not specify the number of workers or the distribution of the savings.

Answer: 0"
929,"Explanation: The claim that the person is the ""first Aggie governor of Texas"" is not verifiable with the information provided. The term ""Aggie"" typically refers to graduates of Texas A&M University, but without specific details about the person's name, term in office, and their connection to Texas A&M, it is impossible to confirm this claim.

Answer: 0"
930,"Explanation: The claim is about Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's collective-bargaining limits and their impact on the city of Milwaukee's budget. Walker implemented collective-bargaining limits in 2011, which restricted public employees' collective bargaining rights. These changes were part of a broader effort to reduce government spending and balance the state's budget. However, the specific impact on the city of Milwaukee's budget is not directly stated in the claim, and the claim does not provide any evidence or context to support the assertion that these limits helped balance the city's budget.

Answer: 0"
931,"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey's public school students have the best Advanced Placement (AP) scores in the nation is not accurate. While New Jersey does have a strong education system and its students often perform well on AP exams, it is not accurate to say that they have the best scores in the nation. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of data.

Answer: 0"
932,"Explanation: The claim states that the 30 percent set aside for affordable housing in urban renewal areas is calculated citywide, not district by district. This claim is false because the 30 percent requirement is typically applied on a project-by-project basis, rather than being a citywide average. Each project within an urban renewal area must meet the 30 percent affordable housing requirement, but the overall citywide percentage can vary based on the specific projects and their locations.

Answer: 0"
933,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, it did not grant personhood status to the preborn. The Dobbs decision merely held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, leaving the issue to the states. The claim that this is the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn is incorrect because there have been other cases and laws that have recognized fetal personhood in various forms.

Answer: 0"
934,"Explanation: The claim that Republican candidates in Oregon are advocating violence against gays is a false statement. There is no evidence to support this claim, and it is a misrepresentation of the political views and actions of Republican candidates in Oregon. Republican candidates, like any other political candidates, may have differing views on various issues, but advocating violence is not a part of their platform or any credible political discourse.

Answer: 0"
935,"Explanation: The claim that ""the debt will soon eclipse our entire economy"" is a broad and vague statement that lacks specific context or data. It is not possible to accurately assess the truth of this claim without knowing which economy is being referred to, what time frame is being considered, and what specific debt is being discussed. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
936,"Explanation: The claim suggests a correlation between gains in Atlanta Public Schools scores on a national standardized test and dramatic score increases on state tests. However, correlation does not imply causation. Gains on a national standardized test do not necessarily indicate that the same improvements will be reflected on state tests. The two tests may have different formats, content, or scoring systems, and improvements on one do not guarantee improvements on the other. Therefore, the claim is not necessarily true.

Answer: 0"
937,"Explanation: A ""no-tax pledge"" is a political promise made by a candidate or politician to not raise taxes. This pledge is often used in political campaigns to attract voters who are opposed to tax increases. However, it is important to note that such pledges can be made without any legal or binding force, and politicians may still raise taxes after being elected if they believe it is necessary for their policy goals. Therefore, the claim that signing a no-tax pledge is a binding legal commitment is false.

Answer: 0"
938,"Explanation: The claim that the number-one source of illegal immigration is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population is not accurate. While it is true that some individuals overstay their visas, the majority of illegal immigrants enter the country through the southern border without proper documentation. According to the U.S. Border Patrol, the majority of apprehensions at the southern border are of individuals who do not have valid entry documents. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security reports that the number of overstays has been decreasing in recent years.

939,"Explanation: There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Al Qaeda has camps with the drug cartels in Mexico. While it is true that Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have attempted to establish links with drug cartels for funding and operational purposes, there is no specific evidence of Al Qaeda having camps or bases in Mexico in collaboration with drug cartels. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the broader issue of transnational criminal networks.

940,"Explanation: The claim that Romneycare (Massachusetts Health Care Reform) sent costs spiraling out of control and hiking premiums is not accurate. While there were initial increases in premiums, the overall impact of Romneycare was to reduce the number of uninsured residents and improve access to healthcare. A study by the Commonwealth Fund found that the uninsured rate in Massachusetts dropped from 10.9% in 2006 to 2.7% in 2015, and the state's health insurance market remained stable. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) built upon Romneycare's framework, and the ACA's implementation has been associated with a reduction in premiums for many Americans.

943,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, the process for selecting delegates to the Republican National Convention is determined by state party rules and does not involve the chairman of the party appointing delegates.

Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

955,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was a significant piece of legislation passed in 2010. It aimed to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance, expand Medicaid, and reduce the number of uninsured Americans. The claim about support for the Affordable Care Act can vary depending on the specific context and the time period being discussed. However, as of my last update in October 2023, the ACA has had varying levels of support and opposition from different political parties and the public. The support for the ACA has been a contentious issue, with some people praising its provisions and others criticizing it.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true, as the Affordable Care Act has had support from various groups and individuals, although the level and nature of this support have varied over time.)"
956,"Explanation: The claim is false. Tim Kaine, a former U.S. Senator and Governor of Virginia, has been accused of appointing a radical jihadi to the Virginia Immigration Commission. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The individual in question, Ali Al-Akhras, is a Muslim community activist and has been involved in various community initiatives, but there is no evidence to suggest that he is a ""radical jihadi"" or that he was appointed to the commission in exchange for campaign contributions. The claim appears to be a misinformation campaign.

Answer: 0"
957,"Explanation: The claim that we are experiencing the worst economic recovery America has ever had is subjective and depends on the specific metrics and timeframes used for comparison. While the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant economic disruption, the recovery has been swift in many ways, with the U.S. economy rebounding quickly after the initial downturn. However, it's important to note that the recovery has been uneven, with some sectors and regions recovering more slowly than others. Therefore, the claim that it is the ""worst"" recovery is not universally accepted and depends on the perspective and criteria used for evaluation.

Answer: 0"
959,"Explanation: The claim states that New Jersey's job growth in May represents 25 percent of all the jobs created in the country. To verify this, we need to compare the number of jobs created in New Jersey with the total number of jobs created in the United States. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, New Jersey added 10,000 jobs in May 2023, while the United States added 375,000 jobs in the same period. To find the percentage, we calculate (10,000 / 375,000) * 100 = 2.66%. This is significantly less than 25%, so the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
960,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Obama in 2010. The primary goal of the ACA was to increase access to affordable health insurance for Americans. While the law has had mixed results, it has indeed brought down the costs for many Americans through various provisions such as subsidies for low- and middle-income individuals, expansion of Medicaid, and the requirement for insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. Therefore, the claim that ""President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs for average Americans"" is false.

Answer: 0"
961,"Explanation: The claim is true. A trade war, which involves countries imposing tariffs or other barriers to trade with each other, can indeed have significant economic impacts. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which was implemented during the Great Depression, is often cited as an example of how protectionist trade policies can exacerbate economic downturns. The act led to a significant increase in tariffs, which reduced international trade and contributed to the length and severity of the Great Depression.

Answer: 1"
962,"Explanation: The claim that China is practicing how to blow up our satellites is a misinterpretation of a real event. In 2021, China conducted an anti-satellite (ASAT) test, which involved the destruction of one of its own satellites. This test was not directed at any other country's satellites, including those of the United States. The test was condemned internationally due to the creation of space debris and the potential threat to other satellites. The claim that China is practicing to blow up our satellites is false and misleading.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the majority of job growth in Virginia has been in the private sector, but it is not as high as ninety percent.

Answer: 0"
973,"Explanation: The claim about Rhode Island having the worst maintained bridges and the second worst maintained roads in the United States is not accurate. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2021 Infrastructure Report Card, Rhode Island's bridges are in fair condition, with a grade of C-. While the state's roads are in poor condition, with a grade of D-, it is not the second worst in the country. Alaska has the worst maintained roads, with a grade of D-, and Rhode Island ranks 40th in the nation for road conditions. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
974,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a specific database used by police to look up wanted suspects excludes certain warrants issued by Atlanta Municipal Court.

Answer: 0"
975,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin road signs have always been made in Wisconsin and that Scott Walker is outsourcing them to an out-of-state company and paying more money for them is false. Wisconsin has indeed historically produced road signs within the state, but there have been instances where the state has outsourced the production to other states or companies. However, the claim that Scott Walker specifically did this and paid more money for them is not supported by reliable sources. The claim is a mix of true and false information, but the specific allegation about Scott Walker is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
978,"Explanation: The claim ""On a timetable to withdraw from Iraq"" is a reference to the U.S. military's withdrawal from Iraq, which was part of the U.S. strategy following the 2003 invasion.

979,"Explanation: The claim that over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from Wisconsin is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total nonfarm employment in the U.S. increased by 212,000 jobs in June 2022. Wisconsin's job growth was 10,000 jobs, which is approximately 4.7% of the total U.S. job growth. Therefore, the claim that over 50 percent of U.S. job growth in June came from Wisconsin is an exaggeration and is not accurate.

986,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island's legislature is the strongest in the country is not accurate. The strength of a legislature is typically measured by factors such as the number of bills passed, the influence of the legislature on national policy, and the effectiveness of its lawmaking processes. Rhode Island's legislature is relatively small and has a lower profile compared to larger states like California or Texas, which have more significant impacts on national policy and have larger legislative bodies. Therefore, it is not accurate to describe Rhode Island's legislature as the strongest in the country.

Answer: 0"
987,"Explanation: The claim that uninsured voters made up about 5 percent of the electorate in 2010 is false.

Answer: 1"
993,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that only 49 out of 3,000 faculty members at Texas A&M University brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead over the past five years is not accurate. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of a specific study or report. It is important to note that the majority of faculty members at any university are not expected to generate revenue to cover their salaries and overhead costs. Instead, they rely on institutional funding, grants, and other sources of income.

996,"Explanation: The claim that Mitch McConnell voted to raise Medicare costs for a current Kentucky senior by $6,000 is false. Medicare costs are determined by the federal government and are not directly influenced by individual senators' votes.

Therefore, it is not accurate to attribute a specific increase in Medicare costs to a single senator's vote.

According to the latest data from the University of Texas System, the four-year graduation rate for the University of Texas at Austin, the flagship campus, was approximately 65.5% in 2020. While the university has been working to improve graduation rates, the claim of a 75% graduation rate is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
998,"Explanation: The claim that Texas children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching is false. Teacher training and preparation are essential components of becoming a certified educator. In Texas, as in most states, teachers must complete a teacher preparation program, pass state certification exams, and often have student teaching experience before they can teach in a classroom. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a teacher would be hired without any teaching practice.
