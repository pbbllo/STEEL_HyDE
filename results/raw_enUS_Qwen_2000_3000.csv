0,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, did not have the authority to pardon individuals for federal crimes, including those involving firearms. Pardons for federal offenses are granted by the President of the United States, not state governors. Additionally, the claim refers to a specific incident involving a ""decorated soldier"" who was charged at age 13, which does not align with typical pardon practices or known cases. There is no public record of Romney pardoning such an individual during his tenure as governor.

Answer: [0]"
1,"Explanation: The claim is false. During the Philippine–American War (1899-1902), American soldiers were accused of using waterboarding, but the U.S. military did not formally recognize waterboarding as torture at that time. The practice of waterboarding was not universally condemned by the U.S. military until much later. In fact, the U.S. military officially banned the use of waterboarding as a form of interrogation in 2007, long after the Philippine–American War had ended. The court-martial mentioned in the claim likely refers to specific incidents where American soldiers were punished for using such methods, rather than a broader recognition of waterboarding as torture.

Answer: [0]"
2,"Explanation: The claim provided does not contain any factual information about the Teamsters' stance on drilling in Alaska or the speaker's voting record on this issue. It is a statement that expresses the speaker's opinion and voting behavior but does not provide enough context to verify its accuracy. Without additional information or evidence, we cannot confirm or deny the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
3,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at reliable health statistics from reputable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or local health departments in Austin. Without specific data showing a significant increase in HIV/AIDS cases among women in Austin, it's not possible to confirm this claim. The claim could be true if there were documented evidence of a rise in these cases, but without such evidence, it cannot be verified.

Answer: [0]"
4,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to determine if there is any credible evidence that Craig Huey has publicly referred to Planned Parenthood as a ""murder mill."" After researching, I found no credible sources or statements from Craig Huey that support this claim. The term ""murder mill"" is often used by anti-abortion activists but without specific evidence linking it to Craig Huey, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: 0"
5,"Explanation: The claim that the conviction rate is almost exactly the same for whites and blacks who commit murder is false. Research and data from various studies and reports indicate significant disparities in conviction rates between different racial groups for similar crimes, including murder. Factors such as systemic biases in the criminal justice system, socioeconomic differences, and variations in how cases are prosecuted can contribute to these disparities.

Answer: [0]"
6,"Explanation: The claim states that New Jersey Network is the only news station covering New Jersey government. This is false because there are multiple news stations and media outlets in New Jersey that cover state government, including local television stations like NJTV, WABC-TV, and WNYC, as well as online news platforms such as NJ.com and The Star-Ledger. These sources provide comprehensive coverage of New Jersey government activities, legislation, and policies.

Answer: [0]"
7,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, generally applies the same health insurance requirements to members of Congress as it does to all other Americans. The ACA mandates that individuals have health insurance coverage or face a penalty, which applies to all citizens, including elected officials. While there may be some differences in how certain provisions are implemented for members of Congress due to their unique status and benefits, the core requirement to have health insurance under the ACA is the same for them as it is for other Americans.

Answer: 0"
8,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need context about who ""he"" is and during which period of his tenure as governor. Without specific details such as the name of the individual and the time frame, it's impossible to verify whether the claim is true or false. However, if we assume a common scenario where a politician might take credit for reducing state spending while in office, the claim could be true if there is evidence that the state's spending was indeed reduced during that period.

Answer: 0

(Note: The answer is 0 because without specific context, we cannot confirm the truthfulness of the claim. If more context were provided, the answer could potentially change to 1 if the claim could be verified as true.)"
9,"Explanation: The claim ""Says she is entering in the most diverse class ever, of U.S. Representatives"" is vague without additional context. To determine if this claim is true, we would need more specific information about who ""she"" is, what time period is being referred to, and how diversity is being measured (e.g., by race, gender, ethnicity, etc.). Without these details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
10,"Explanation: This claim makes several specific assertions about state Sen. Steve Ogden's actions and their impacts. To evaluate the truthfulness of these claims, we would need to examine historical records, legislative documents, and official statements from relevant sources.

1. **Driving force behind business income tax hurting small business**: This would require evidence showing that Sen. Ogden was the primary advocate for such a tax and that it had a significant negative impact on small businesses. Without specific references or data, this cannot be verified as true or false.

2. **Crafted the Robin Hood school finance scheme**: The ""Robin Hood"" school finance scheme refers to a policy aimed at redistributing school funding. If Sen. Ogden was indeed involved in crafting this scheme and it led to increased property taxes, this would need to be substantiated with legislative records and analyses.

3. **Wrote a budget resulting in a $14 billion deficit**: Budget deficits are typically the result of a combination of spending and revenue decisions made by multiple parties over time. While a senator might influence a budget, attributing a specific deficit amount to one individual without context is not accurate.

4. **Voted against gun freedoms**: This would require documentation of specific votes and the context surrounding them. Without such details, this cannot be confirmed.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context to verify each part of the claim, it is not possible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false based solely on the provided information.

Answer: [0]"
11,"Explanation: The claim that ""our first president and our first commander in chief prayed every day"" is partially true, but the statement about having a ""field manual of prayers"" is not accurate. George Washington, the first president of the United States, was known for his religious observance and often referred to prayer in his writings and public addresses. However, there is no historical evidence to support the existence of a ""field manual of prayers"" as described in the claim. 

Answer: 1

The reason for choosing 1 is that while George Washington did pray regularly, there is no documented evidence of him having a specific ""field manual of prayers."" Therefore, the claim is partially true but includes an unsupported detail."
12,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as official statements from the FBI or news outlets that report on such investigations. Without specific information indicating that Congressman Renacci is currently under FBI investigation, we cannot confirm this claim. Therefore, based on the available information, this claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
13,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent job market data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or other economic reports that track employment trends across states. Without specific data for Ohio and a comparison with other states for the past year, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. The claim could be true if Ohio indeed saw significant job growth compared to other states, but without concrete numbers, we cannot confirm its validity.

Answer: 0"
14,"Explanation: This claim is vague and does not provide specific details about which budget plan, the amount of money involved, or the exact nature of the road paving project. Without these specifics, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, such claims often lack context regarding the overall state budget and how funds are allocated between different sectors.

Answer: 0"
15,"Explanation: The claim ""Were the highest taxed nation in the world"" is incomplete as it does not specify which country ""were"" refers to. However, assuming the claim is about a specific country, we would need to check historical tax data for that country against global tax data from the same period to verify if it was indeed the highest taxed nation.

Answer: 0

(Note: Without a specific country mentioned, it's impossible to definitively verify the claim. If a specific country were provided, I could conduct a more detailed analysis using reliable sources like the World Bank or International Monetary Fund data on tax revenues as a percentage of GDP.)"
16,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data from reliable sources that track law enforcement officer fatalities. According to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, as of 2023, Texas has indeed reported the highest number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty among all states. The fund provides a comprehensive database of such incidents.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because Texas has consistently had the highest number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty compared to other states over recent years."
17,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including public records, financial disclosures, and company information. Rick Scott, who served as the Governor of Florida from 2011 to 2019, is known for his business interests. However, there is no widely reported or verified information suggesting that he has heavily invested in a company specifically designed to help illegal aliens transfer money. Companies like Western Union and MoneyGram are well-known for such services, but there is no credible evidence linking Rick Scott to such a company.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be false based on the lack of credible evidence supporting it."
18,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if Sandy Pasch indeed voted for a bill that cut school aid by nearly $300 million. This would require checking the voting records of the state Senate during the relevant period and cross-referencing them with the details provided in the claim. Without access to specific legislative records and voting data, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if such records exist and show that Sandy Pasch did vote for a bill cutting school aid by nearly $300 million, then the claim would be true.

Answer: [0]"
19,"Explanation: The claim that more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock is false. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the most recent figures show that in 2019, about 71.1% of births to Black women were to unmarried mothers. This figure has been declining since its peak in 2007 when it was around 75%. While the percentage is high, it does not exceed 72% as stated in the claim.

Answer: [0]"
20,"Explanation: The claim provided is incomplete and lacks specific details such as the state in question and a reliable source for the number of undocumented immigrants. Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, immigration statistics can vary significantly by state and over time, often requiring data from official government sources like the U.S. Census Bureau or Department of Homeland Security.

Answer: 0"
21,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the results from the 2012 United States presidential election in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Mitt Romney did not receive any votes in certain precincts where he was not a candidate or where there were no records of his vote count. This is because in some precincts, only the Democratic primary candidates were on the ballot, and Mitt Romney was a Republican candidate. Therefore, he would not have appeared on the ballot in those precincts and thus could not have received any votes.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because in certain precincts where only Democratic candidates were on the ballot, Mitt Romney, as a Republican candidate, did not receive any votes."
22,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of new jobs created this year, broken down by full-time and part-time categories. Without such data from a reliable source like government labor statistics or reputable economic reports, it's impossible to determine if the overwhelming majority of new jobs are indeed part-time. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual numbers.

Answer: 0"
23,"Explanation: The claim ""Says his plan would cut taxes without increasing the deficit"" is a statement about a policy proposal. To evaluate its truth, we need to consider whether such a plan is theoretically possible and whether it has been implemented successfully in practice.

In economic terms, cutting taxes typically reduces government revenue, which could potentially increase the deficit unless offset by other measures (like spending cuts or increased revenue from other sources). Therefore, a plan that claims to cut taxes without increasing the deficit would need to show how it achieves this without any counterbalancing factors.

While there may be theoretical models or specific plans that attempt to achieve this goal, in practice, it is extremely rare for such a plan to be realized without any trade-offs or additional measures. Many economists argue that it is nearly impossible to cut taxes significantly without increasing the deficit, as reducing government revenue directly impacts the budget balance.

Answer: [0]"
24,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the minimum wages of various developed countries. According to data from the International Labor Organization (ILO) and other economic reports, the United States has a minimum wage that is indeed among the lower ranks when compared to other developed nations. As of recent data, several countries like Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Germany have significantly higher minimum wages than the U.S. The U.S. minimum wage is often cited as being around $7.25 per hour (as of 2009), which is notably lower than many other developed countries.

Answer: 1

The claim that the U.S. has the third-lowest minimum wage among developed countries is generally considered accurate based on available international data."
25,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but also contains some inaccuracies. President Barack Obama did support access to reproductive health care, including abortion, during his campaign. However, he did not explicitly declare that ""everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion"" as a core part of his health care reform plan. Instead, he supported the idea of comprehensive coverage for reproductive health services, which included family planning services such as contraception and abortion. His stance was generally pro-choice and he believed in the importance of reproductive rights, but he did not frame it as a central component of his health care reform plan.

Answer: [0]"
26,"Explanation: The claim ""Says library district would come at no direct cost to the city budget"" suggests that establishing a library district would not require any additional funds from the city's budget. However, this statement is too vague without context about how the library district would be funded. Typically, creating a new district might involve costs such as administrative expenses, infrastructure development, or ongoing operational costs, which could be funded through various means like property taxes, grants, or other sources. Without specific information indicating that these costs would be entirely covered by external funding and not impact the city budget, we cannot assume it comes at no direct cost.

Answer: [0]"
27,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible evidence or historical record supporting the assertion that Kendrick Meek made such a specific claim about his candidacy in relation to Sonia Sotomayor's suitability for the Supreme Court. Political candidates often make general statements about their qualifications and those of others, but there is no documented instance of Meek making this particular claim. Additionally, such a specific and unverified claim would likely be scrutinized and challenged by other political figures and media outlets.

Answer: [0]"
28,"Explanation: The claim is incomplete and lacks specific details such as the state name and the exact rates being compared. Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify whether the state's unemployment rate is indeed the fifth-highest in the country, how it compares to the national average, and whether it is higher than all neighboring states. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive judgment about the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
29,"Explanation: This claim is false. The term ""Obama-Clinton war on coal"" is a political rhetoric often used by conservative media and politicians to criticize environmental policies that affect the coal industry. However, there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that these policies specifically caused such a large number of job losses in Michigan. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the coal mining industry in Michigan has been declining for decades due to various factors including automation, competition from other energy sources, and global market changes, not just U.S. government policies. Additionally, the number of coal-related jobs in Michigan was already in decline before the Obama administration took office.

Answer: [0]"
30,"Explanation: The claim that there are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year is difficult to verify without a specific context (such as which country's borders are being referred to). However, according to data from the Pew Research Center, the number of unauthorized immigrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border has fluctuated over the years but has generally been much lower than 350,000 annually. For instance, in fiscal year 2019, the number was around 400,000, but this includes both apprehensions and returns, not just successful crossings. Additionally, the term ""illegal"" can be subjective and may include various legal statuses such as asylum seekers or those with pending cases.

Answer: [0]"
31,"Explanation: The claim states that six convictions are connected to an allegation by prosecutors that Gov. Scott Walker is at the center of a criminal scheme. To evaluate this, we need to look at the factual evidence regarding any such allegations against Governor Scott Walker. As of my last update, there have been no convictions directly linking Governor Scott Walker to a criminal scheme. Various investigations and legal proceedings have been conducted, but none have resulted in convictions that implicate him in a criminal scheme. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
32,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is called the ""Badger State"" because ancestors came with the hope of living the American dream by mining is false. The term ""Badger State"" actually originated from early settlers who lived in badger holes or dug for badgers. The state was officially named so in 1845, long before significant mining activities began in Wisconsin. While mining did become a major industry in Wisconsin later, it was not the reason for the state's nickname.

Answer: [0]"
33,"Explanation: This claim appears to be referencing national reading proficiency levels for African-American and Hispanic boys in the United States. According to data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which is a large-scale assessment of student achievement in the U.S., the percentages of African-American and Hispanic fourth-grade boys reading below proficient levels have been around these figures. For example, in 2019, 85% of African-American fourth-grade boys and 83% of Hispanic fourth-grade boys were not at the proficient level in reading. The slight discrepancy between the claim and the actual data could be due to rounding or a specific year being referenced.

Answer: 1"
34,"Explanation: The claim provided does not contain any specific details such as dates, names, or locations that would allow for a factual verification. It is a vague statement that lacks context and concrete information necessary to determine its truthfulness. Without additional context or evidence, it is impossible to confirm or deny whether a Shred-It truck rolled up to Republican headquarters on the day a state leader resigned.

Answer: 0"
35,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the number of executions conducted by each state over a specific period. According to data from the Death Penalty Information Center, Texas has indeed executed the most people since the modern death penalty was reinstated in 1976. As of the latest available data, Texas has carried out more executions than any other state.

Answer: 1"
36,"Explanation: The claim that tax rates were significantly higher ""in the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s"" is generally true. During World War II, the U.S. government implemented high tax rates to fund the war effort. For example, the top marginal income tax rate reached as high as 94% during the peak of the war. After the war, these rates remained high but gradually decreased over time. In the 1950s and 1960s, the top marginal income tax rate was still above 90%, though it had been slightly reduced from the wartime levels. This high rate was maintained to support various social programs and to address income inequality.

Answer: 1"
37,"Explanation: The claim is false. John McCain, a Republican Senator from Arizona, was actually a strong advocate for honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He co-sponsored legislation to establish a federal holiday in Dr. King's honor, which was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. The holiday was first observed in 1989.

Answer: [0]"
38,"Explanation: The claim that risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism, is not accurate based on historical records and available data. While Donald Trump's presidency was indeed a significant factor in global economic discussions and analyses, it is important to note that risk assessments often consider multiple factors and sources. In many reports from reputable financial and economic institutions, such as the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report, terrorism has consistently been listed among the top global risks alongside other issues like cyber threats, climate change, and geopolitical tensions. Donald Trump's presidency was certainly a notable event, but it was not universally ranked above terrorism in terms of global economic threats.

Answer: [0]"
39,"Explanation: The claim is accurate according to data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other economic studies. In 2007, the top 1 percent of income earners in the United States indeed reported earning a significant portion of the total income. According to the IRS, the top 1 percent of taxpayers earned about 21.8% of all income, while the bottom 50% of taxpayers earned approximately 12.9% of the total income. This means that the top 1 percent did earn more than the combined income of the bottom 50%.

Answer: 1"
40,"Explanation: The claim states that more than 12,500 service members were discharged due to their sexual orientation under the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" (DADT) policy, and that this resulted in a cost of over $360 million. Additionally, it claims that many of these individuals had special skills like translators, engineers, and pilots.

The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was in effect from 1994 to 2011. According to the Department of Defense, during this period, approximately 13,600 service members were discharged for being gay or lesbian, which aligns with the claim of more than 12,500. However, the exact cost of these discharges is not definitively documented in the same way. The DoD did not keep detailed records of the financial impact of these discharges, making it difficult to confirm the $360 million figure. Furthermore, while the claim mentions that many of those discharged had special skills, there is no specific data provided to support this assertion.

Answer: 0

The claim is partially accurate regarding the number of discharges but lacks reliable evidence to support the exact cost figure and the specific mention of high-demand skills among those discharged. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified and is considered false."
41,"Explanation: The claim states that out of 13 Bill Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years when his wife Hillary Clinton was not serving as Secretary of State. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the dates of these speeches and the periods Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State (2009-2013). Without such detailed information, it's impossible to verify the exact number of speeches that fit this criterion. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed or denied with the given information.

Answer: 0"
42,"Explanation: The claim ""Our reserves are now in much better shape than they were just a few years ago"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without specific context, such as what type of reserves (oil, water, financial, etc.), the time frame being referred to, and the criteria for determining ""better shape."" Reserves can improve due to various factors like increased production, reduced consumption, or improved management, but these improvements need to be quantitatively measured against a baseline to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
43,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but also misleading. In many states, voters have the option to vote before Election Day through various methods such as absentee ballots, mail-in ballots, or early voting. However, the statement ""In 32 other states and Washington D.C."" is not accurate because it does not account for the fact that early voting and absentee voting options are available in all 50 states and Washington D.C. Additionally, the term ""avoid the wait"" might be misleading since the availability of these voting methods does not guarantee a completely wait-free experience.

Answer: 0"
44,"Explanation: The claim suggests that responding to a major snow event in Atlanta would be similar to Kansas City, Mo., responding to a major earthquake. This comparison is not accurate because the two scenarios involve different types of natural disasters with distinct impacts and responses.

Atlanta, being in the southeastern United States, is not typically prepared for heavy snowfall, which can lead to significant disruptions in infrastructure and daily life. However, a major earthquake would present a completely different set of challenges, such as structural damage, potential landslides, and aftershocks, which require immediate and specialized emergency responses.

Kansas City, Mo., located in the central United States, is more accustomed to dealing with winter weather conditions and has developed systems to manage snow events. In contrast, earthquakes are rare in this region, and the city's response plans would focus on different aspects such as search and rescue operations, assessing structural damage, and providing emergency medical care.

Answer: [0]"
45,"Explanation: Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani was indeed sentenced to stoning in Iran. She was convicted of charges including adultery and sorcery, and the sentence was initially carried out in 2010, though it was later suspended due to international pressure and appeals. The sentence was later commuted to a prison term.

Answer: 0"
46,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump supported the impeachment of President George W. Bush is false. Donald Trump was a supporter of George W. Bush and his presidency. In fact, Trump ran for president as a member of the Republican Party, which was the same party as Bush. Throughout his career and during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump praised Bush's leadership and policies. There is no historical evidence to suggest that Trump ever supported the impeachment of President Bush.

Answer: [0]"
47,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of the statement. The claim suggests that a specific individual's political opponent had their campaign contributions investigated by the federal government in 2008. Without more specific information about who the opponent was and in what context this occurred, it's challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, given the broad nature of campaign finance laws and investigations in the United States, such an investigation could have occurred. To confirm the truth of this claim, we would need to look into the specific case and the records of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) or other relevant authorities.

Answer: [0]"
48,"Explanation: The claim states that New Jersey opened offices in Shanghai and London after a decade without any foreign trade offices and subsequently saw an 18 percent increase in exports. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on when New Jersey last had foreign trade offices, the exact dates these new offices were established, and the export figures before and after their establishment. Without such concrete data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional supporting evidence."
49,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Chris Christie's campaign promises during his gubernatorial run. There is no widely known or documented evidence suggesting that Chris Christie specifically promised ""no school cuts"" as part of his campaign platform. In fact, Christie was known for his efforts to reduce state spending and balance the budget, which often included cuts to various programs, including education. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
50,"Explanation: The claim states that the Texas Department of Agriculture seeks to purchase up to 300,000 promotional stress balls. To evaluate this claim, we would need to look for official announcements or press releases from the Texas Department of Agriculture that confirm such a purchase. Without any credible source or official statement supporting this claim, it cannot be verified as true. Additionally, the Texas Department of Agriculture typically focuses on agricultural matters rather than promoting non-agricultural items like stress balls.

Answer: [0]"
51,"Explanation: The claim suggests that someone is clarifying their statement about Dr. George Tiller, stating they did not call him a ""baby killer"" as some liberal groups have charged, but were instead reporting what pro-life activists referred to him as. This clarification indicates that the person in question is attempting to distance themselves from the term ""baby killer,"" which is a highly charged and emotionally loaded term often used by pro-life advocates to describe doctors who perform abortions. By stating they were merely reporting what pro-life groups called Tiller, the speaker is likely trying to present a more neutral stance while acknowledging the terminology used by those who oppose abortion.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be true because it accurately reflects a common practice in journalism where reporters may clarify their statements to avoid misinterpretation or to present information in a balanced manner."
52,"Explanation: The claim that ""In preparing a rules package for the 112th Congress, the GOP had no discussions with Democrats"" is likely false. In the legislative process, it is common for both parties to engage in discussions and negotiations to reach a consensus on rules packages. This helps ensure that the rules are acceptable to a majority of members and can pass through the House and Senate. Without such discussions, it would be highly unusual for a rules package to be successfully implemented.

Answer: [0]"
53,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the tax policies of various countries. While the U.S. does offer a wide range of deductions and incentives for corporations through its tax code, such as research and development credits, investment in certain types of property, and expensing of certain business costs, it is not necessarily the country with the most number of deductions available to corporations. Countries like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom also have extensive tax incentive programs for businesses. Additionally, the specific deductions available can change over time due to legislative actions.

Answer: 0"
54,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. UPS, like many large corporations, typically provides comprehensive health insurance benefits to its employees, including their spouses. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires employers to offer health insurance to their full-time employees, but it does not mandate that they provide coverage for spouses. Furthermore, the ACA includes subsidies for individuals purchasing insurance through the exchanges, which are available regardless of whether an employer offers a group plan or not. Therefore, it is unlikely that UPS would leave 15,000 of its employees' spouses without health insurance and direct them to the exchange without any form of support.

Answer: [0]"
55,"Explanation: The claim ""GEORGIA ROADWAY FATALITIES THIS YEAR: 59 PLEASE DRIVE SAFELY"" is a statistical statement about road fatalities in Georgia for a specific year. To evaluate its truthfulness, we would need access to official data from the Georgia Department of Transportation or another reliable source that provides such statistics for the current year. Without verifying this information against a credible source, it's impossible to confirm or deny the accuracy of the number provided.

Answer: [0]"
56,"Explanation: The claim ""We didn't have a development director for over seven months"" cannot be verified without additional context such as the specific organization, time period being referred to, and any relevant records or communications that might confirm or deny this statement. However, if we assume that there is no conflicting information available and the statement is made by someone who should know about the organizational structure, then it could be true.

Answer: [0/1] 0 (This would be 0 if there is no supporting evidence or if the claim is contradicted by available information. Since we don't have specific details, we cannot definitively say it's true, hence the default is 0.)"
57,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific records of Kim Simac's property tax payments over the past nine years. Without access to such detailed financial records or a reliable source confirming these details, it is not possible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional evidence or a reliable source to confirm the details about Kim Simac's property tax payments."
58,"Explanation: The claim that Medicare spends ""$15-billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies"" is false. Medicare, which is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and older and certain younger people with disabilities, does not provide direct subsidies to insurance companies. Instead, Medicare contracts with private insurance companies to provide coverage under Medicare Advantage plans. These plans receive a fixed amount of money from Medicare to cover each enrollee, but these payments are not considered subsidies to insurance companies; they are payments for services rendered. The term ""subsidy"" typically refers to financial assistance provided directly to individuals or entities to reduce the cost of goods or services.

Answer: [0]"
59,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the spending during the 111th Congress under the Democratic majority with the total spending over the first 100 Congresses. The 111th Congress was from January 3, 2009, to January 3, 2011, which covers a period of about two years. According to historical data, the 111th Congress saw significant increases in spending due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, which aimed to stimulate the economy during the Great Recession.

The total spending during the 111th Congress was approximately $4.7 trillion, including the ARRA and other legislation. In contrast, the total spending over the first 100 Congresses (from 1789 to 1946) was significantly lower, as the U.S. economy and government were much smaller. Historical estimates suggest that the total spending over these 100 Congresses was around $1.5 trillion when adjusted for inflation.

Given these figures, it is clear that the spending during the 111th Congress was indeed much higher than the combined spending of the first 100 Congresses.

Answer: 1"
60,"Explanation: The claim that 29 states no longer have a death tax because the tax damaged their economic competitiveness is not accurate. The death tax, also known as the estate tax, was repealed at the federal level in the United States with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. However, many states still have their own estate taxes. Additionally, the repeal of the federal estate tax did not result in all states eliminating their own estate taxes. Some states chose to maintain their estate taxes for various reasons, such as funding public services or addressing wealth inequality. Therefore, the claim that the death tax was universally eliminated due to its impact on economic competitiveness is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
61,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire during the terrorist attack in Benghazi is false. The Benghazi attack occurred on September 11, 2012, and the first U.S. military reinforcements arrived within hours of the attack. Additionally, the U.S. government provided immediate assistance to the victims and their families. The delay in response was not due to Clinton's actions but rather due to the chaotic situation and the need for coordination among various agencies.

Answer: [0]"
62,"Explanation: The claim states that thirty U.S. cities have Triple A baseball teams and that virtually everyone of them plays in government-owned ballparks. To evaluate this, we need to consider both parts of the statement.

First, regarding the number of Triple A teams, as of the latest data available, there are approximately 30 Triple A teams in the United States. This part of the claim is accurate.

Second, about the ownership of the ballparks, while many Triple A teams do play in ballparks owned by local governments, it is not universally true. Many ballparks are privately owned or managed by local sports authorities, even if they are located in publicly owned land. For example, the ballpark for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs (Triple A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies) is owned by a private entity but sits on land owned by the city of Allentown.

Given these points, the claim is partially accurate but not entirely true because not every Triple A team plays in a government-owned ballpark.

Answer: [0]"
63,"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker led the effort in Arkansas to improve schools in 1983. To evaluate this, we would need specific evidence such as legislation passed, reports published, or public statements from that time period that directly attribute the improvement efforts to the speaker. Without such evidence, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true without additional supporting evidence. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false."
64,"Explanation: This claim is misleading and does not accurately reflect the data on income levels and unemployment rates for African-Americans during President Barack Obama's tenure. While it is true that the Great Recession had a significant impact on many Americans, including African-Americans, the economic policies and actions taken during Obama's presidency actually led to improvements in these areas. For instance, the African-American unemployment rate dropped from 16.7% in October 2009 to 8.7% in February 2014, which was the lowest rate since 2008. Additionally, median household income for African-Americans increased by 5.1% from 2009 to 2012, though it is important to note that income growth was slower compared to other racial groups.

Answer: [0]"
65,"Explanation: The claim ""I did not vote to spend money to fight that (Amendment 6 redistricting) lawsuit"" cannot be verified without additional context. To determine the truth of this statement, we would need to know the specific voting record of the individual making the claim regarding the spending of funds for the lawsuit related to Amendment 6 redistricting. Without such information, it is impossible to confirm or deny whether the person voted against such spending.

Answer: 0"
66,"Explanation: The claim ""One year today since #GOP took control of the House and no new jobs"" is incomplete without a specific date or context. However, based on the general statement, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Date and Context**: The claim mentions ""one year today,"" which implies a specific date. Without knowing the exact date, it's impossible to verify the claim accurately.

2. **Job Creation**: The claim suggests that there have been no new jobs created under the Republican-controlled House for one year. This would require data on job creation rates during that period, which is not provided in the claim.

3. **Subjectivity**: Job creation can be measured in various ways (e.g., total number of jobs, net job growth, types of jobs), and the claim does not specify how ""new jobs"" are defined.

Given these considerations, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false without additional context and data.

Answer: [0]"
67,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the roles of both Patrick Gaspard and Bertha Lewis, and whether they had a direct working relationship as described.

Patrick Gaspard is known to have worked in various political capacities. He served as the White House Political Director under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011. However, Bertha Lewis was the executive director of ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) from 2003 to 2010. While both were involved in political and community organizing work during overlapping periods, there is no widely recognized public record indicating that Gaspard served as the ""right-hand man"" for Bertha Lewis at any point in time.

Answer: [0]"
68,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent educational rankings for Ohio schools. As of the latest available data, Ohio has not consistently ranked in the top five nationally for education quality. Various national rankings, such as those from U.S. News & World Report or other educational rating organizations, typically place Ohio in the middle to upper-middle range but rarely in the top five positions. Additionally, Education Week, a reputable source for education news and analysis, does not currently rank states or individual schools in the top five nationally. Therefore, the claim that Education Week rates Ohio schools in the top five in the nation is false.

Answer: [0]"
69,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify if there was indeed an earmark in a federal spending bill specifically allocated for potato pest management in Wisconsin. Earmarks are specific funding requests that legislators insert into legislation, often for local projects or initiatives. However, without access to the actual text of the spending bill in question or a reliable source confirming this earmark, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and thus, it remains unconfirmed."
70,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a credit agency has stated that Representative Gibbs recklessly caused a downgrade in credit ratings and higher interest rates. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting such a statement from a recognized credit rating agency like Moody's, S&P Global Ratings, or Fitch Ratings.

Without specific details about which credit agency made this statement or the context in which it was made, it is difficult to verify the claim. However, if a credit agency were to make such a statement, it would typically be accompanied by detailed analysis and evidence explaining the rationale behind the downgrade and the actions of the representative that led to it.

Given the lack of specific information and without being able to confirm this from a reliable source, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
71,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the scale of the project, the cost, and its status as the largest and most expensive infrastructure project in North America. While the claim does not provide specific details about the project, it suggests that the pipeline is both large and costly. However, without concrete data from reliable sources such as government reports or industry analyses, it is difficult to confirm the exact cost and the comparative size against other major infrastructure projects in North America.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence, and thus, based on the information provided, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the statement."
72,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data from reputable sources such as the Federal Reserve, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or housing research organizations. According to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which provides comprehensive data on household finances, including mortgage characteristics, the percentage of Hispanic homeowners with subprime mortgages has varied over time but does not consistently reach 40%. For example, in 2016, the SCF reported that about 25% of Hispanic homeowners had subprime mortgages. This figure is significantly lower than the claimed 40%.

Answer: 0"
73,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false because there is no historical record or credible source attributing these exact words to Lee Fisher. Lee Fisher was a former Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas, known for his strong support of gun rights. It is highly unlikely that he would have made such a statement given his political stance.

Answer: [0]"
74,"Explanation: The claim ""I was the first member of Congress to contribute to Donald Trump"" is likely false. Donald Trump ran for president multiple times, and there is no historical evidence suggesting that any member of Congress contributed to his campaign before him. In fact, political contributions from members of Congress to presidential candidates are not common due to ethical and legal restrictions. Additionally, the term ""first member of Congress"" to contribute to Trump would imply a unique and unprecedented action, which is unlikely given the established norms and regulations surrounding political contributions.

Answer: [0]"
75,"Explanation: The claim ""I have received more contributions than any other candidate in the race, Republican or Democrat"" cannot be verified without specific data on the financial contributions of all candidates in the race. Contributions can vary widely depending on the election, the year, and the specific candidates running. Without access to a comprehensive and up-to-date database of campaign finance reports for all candidates in the relevant race, it is impossible to confirm whether this statement is accurate.

Answer: [0]"
76,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Hawaii has a political culture where incumbents rarely lose elections. To evaluate this, we need to consider historical election data from Hawaii. In recent decades, Hawaii has seen competitive elections where incumbents have been defeated. For example, in the 2018 U.S. House race, Republican incumbent David Ige lost his seat to Democrat Colleen Hanabusa. Additionally, in the 2020 gubernatorial race, incumbent David Ige was defeated by Democrat Josh Green. These examples indicate that Hawaii does experience instances where incumbents are thrown out of office.

Answer: 0"
77,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify two pieces of information: 1) Ohio's ranking in the nation for its economy when Governor John Kasich took office, and 2) Ohio's ranking in terms of economic job growth at that time.

According to various sources, including reports from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and other economic analyses, Ohio's economy was not ranked 38th in the nation when John Kasich took office in January 2011. In fact, Ohio's economy was performing relatively well compared to other states during that period. Additionally, Ohio did experience significant job growth under Kasich's tenure, which aligns with the statement that it was sixth in the nation in terms of economic job growth.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because Ohio's economy was not 38th in the nation when Governor John Kasich took office."
78,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker ""literally invented a $3.6 billion deficit"" is false. Deficits are not something that politicians ""invent""; they arise from the difference between government revenues and expenditures over a given period. Walker, like any other governor, had to deal with existing fiscal situations and make decisions about budgeting and spending. While he was involved in significant budget cuts and changes during his tenure, attributing the creation of a specific deficit amount to him as if it were a deliberate act of invention is inaccurate.

Answer: [0]"
79,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the number of veterans per capita in Virginia compared to other states. According to recent data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Census Bureau, Virginia does indeed have a high concentration of veterans. As of the latest available data, Virginia ranks among the top states with the highest number of veterans per capita. However, it's important to note that the ranking can change over time due to various factors such as population growth and military base closures.

Answer: 1

The claim is true based on the most recent data available, indicating that Virginia has more veterans per capita than many other states in the country."
80,"Explanation: The claim that ""today you can't rely on (the retirement fund for public employees), it's not funded"" is too broad and lacks specific context. Retirement funds for public employees can vary significantly from country to country and even within different states or regions of a country. Some public employee retirement systems are well-funded and reliable, while others may face funding challenges due to various economic factors, mismanagement, or changes in legislation.

To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need more specific information about which particular retirement fund is being referred to and the current status of its funding. Without such details, it's impossible to determine if the claim is universally true or false.

Answer: 0"
81,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare Florida's payday lending regulations with those of other states. Payday lending regulations vary widely across the United States. Some states have strict regulations, while others have very few. Florida has implemented some measures to regulate payday lenders, such as requiring a minimum income-to-debt ratio for borrowers and limiting the number of loans a borrower can take out in a year. However, many states have even stricter regulations, including outright bans on payday lending or more stringent requirements for lenders. For example, states like California, New York, and Illinois have more comprehensive regulations that include higher minimum income-to-debt ratios, longer cooling-off periods between loans, and more extensive reporting requirements.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because Florida's payday lending regulations are not considered the strongest compared to most other states. Many states have implemented more stringent measures to protect consumers from predatory lending practices."
82,"Explanation: This claim is quite broad and lacks specific data or sources to support it. Without a reliable and recent study or survey that provides statistics on the physical and mental fitness of young adults in the country, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the term ""young adults"" can refer to a wide age range (typically 18-25 years old), and what constitutes ""not fit to serve"" can vary depending on the context (e.g., military service, public service, etc.). Therefore, without concrete evidence, we cannot confirm the validity of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
83,"Explanation: The claim is false. In 2014, the Agriculture Act (also known as the Farm Bill) was signed into law, which included a provision allowing states to conduct research on industrial hemp production. This effectively removed federal prohibition on the cultivation of industrial hemp for research purposes, provided that the hemp is grown under a state program and meets certain criteria. Additionally, in 2018, the Farm Bill was further amended to remove industrial hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, making it legal to grow at the federal level as long as it contains less than 0.3% THC.

Answer: [0]"
84,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two parts: the job creation rate in the first six months of the current year compared to the entire year of 2011, and whether 2011 was indeed the best year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000.

1. **Job Creation Rate**: The claim states that as many jobs were created in the first six months of the current year as in the entire year of 2011. This would imply a very high rate of job creation in the first half of the current year. However, without specific data from both the first six months of the current year and the full year of 2011, it's impossible to verify this claim definitively.

2. **Best Year for Private-Sector Job Growth Since 2000**: The claim also asserts that 2011 was the best year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000. This would require comparing the number of jobs created in 2011 with those in other years since 2000. Again, without access to comprehensive data on private-sector job growth for each relevant year, this part of the claim cannot be verified.

Given the lack of specific data to support these claims, we cannot conclusively determine their accuracy. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be verified as true or false.

Answer: [0]"
85,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every poll you see, the overwhelming majority of people want E-Verify"" is false. This statement is overly broad and does not accurately reflect the results of actual polling data. Polling results on E-Verify can vary significantly depending on the context, the specific question asked, and the demographic surveyed. Some polls may show strong support for E-Verify among certain groups, while others might show mixed or even opposing views. Additionally, public opinion can change over time and may be influenced by various factors such as political climate, economic conditions, and awareness of the issue.

Answer: [0]"
86,"Explanation: The claim that it costs taxpayers more than $1 million simply to operate the governor's mansion over a four-year term is highly dependent on the specific state and its budgeting practices. In some states, the cost of maintaining a governor's mansion might be significantly higher due to extensive security measures, luxury amenities, and high maintenance costs. However, in other states, the costs might be much lower, especially if the mansion is not used for official functions or if the state opts for a more modest approach.

To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need to look at the specific budget details of the state in question. Without such data, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information about the specific state and its budgeting practices for the governor's mansion."
87,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump supports eminent domain and the Supreme Court's Kelo decision is partially accurate but requires context. Eminent domain is a legal power that allows the government to take private property for public use, often with compensation. The Kelo v. City of New London case (2005) upheld the city's right to use eminent domain to transfer property from one private owner to another to promote economic development. While it is true that the Kelo decision supported the use of eminent domain for economic development purposes, Donald Trump has expressed support for the concept of eminent domain in general. However, he has also criticized the Kelo decision for allowing the government to take property from one private owner to give to another for economic gain. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate without specifying the context of Trump's support.

Answer: [0]"
88,"Explanation: The claim ""On adoption by gay couples"" is incomplete and lacks specific details to be evaluated as true or false. To properly assess this claim, we would need more context such as a statement about the legality, success rate, or statistics related to gay couples adopting children.

Answer: 0

(Note: The score of 0 is given because the claim as stated does not provide enough information to determine its truthfulness.)"
89,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Matt Patten received money from Frank Russo and Jimmy Dimora for a ""dirty campaign."" However, without specific evidence or context to support this statement, it cannot be verified as true. The term ""dirty campaign"" is vague and could refer to various unethical practices, but the claim does not provide enough details to substantiate the source of funds or the nature of the alleged campaign.

Answer: [0]"
90,"Explanation: The claim that seventy percent of the people living in abject poverty are women is false. While it is true that women are disproportionately affected by poverty, the exact percentage varies widely depending on the region, country, and specific data sources used. According to the United Nations, globally, about 90% of extreme poverty is found in developing regions, and women often face additional barriers such as gender discrimination, limited access to education, and economic opportunities, which contribute to their higher likelihood of living in poverty. However, attributing exactly 70% of abject poverty to women oversimplifies the issue and does not reflect the complex global statistics.

Answer: [0]"
91,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the statement regarding Rutgers University's football program under head coach Greg Schiano and its graduation rates compared to other Division I football programs. While it is possible for a specific coach to have a high graduation rate, it would be necessary to verify the actual statistics from reliable sources such as the NCAA or other educational reports. Without access to the most recent and accurate data, it is not possible to confirm whether Rutgers had the best graduation rate among all Division I football programs during Schiano's tenure.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without current and reliable data, so it is considered false until proven otherwise."
92,"Explanation: This claim generalizes a complex social issue by attributing a lack of understanding of poverty to people of a certain race. It oversimplifies the experiences of poverty and racial identity, ignoring the fact that poverty can affect individuals from any racial background. Additionally, it implies that being white inherently means one cannot understand the struggles of poverty, which is not supported by evidence or experience.

Answer: [0]"
93,"Explanation: The claim ""Nobodys addicted to marijuana"" is false. While it is true that not everyone who uses marijuana becomes addicted, there is evidence that some individuals can develop a substance use disorder related to marijuana use. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 9% of people who use marijuana will become addicted, and the risk increases with higher frequency of use and earlier age of onset. Therefore, it is inaccurate to state that no one is addicted to marijuana.

Answer: [0]"
94,"Explanation: This claim requires a detailed examination of the fiscal policies implemented by Governor Scott Walker during his tenure in Wisconsin. The statement suggests that Walker took money from schools and used it to provide tax breaks to the wealthy. To evaluate this, we would need to look at specific budget documents, spending reports, and tax data from the period in question.

Historically, Walker's administration did implement significant changes to the state's budget and tax structure. For instance, he signed into law a bill that eliminated the state income tax for most taxpayers, which could be seen as providing tax breaks to many residents. However, the claim also suggests that this was funded by reducing school funding. This would require evidence showing that the money taken from education was directly reallocated to tax cuts.

Without specific data and context, it's difficult to definitively confirm or deny the exact figures mentioned ($1.6 billion from schools and $2 billion in tax breaks). However, based on known policy actions and budget changes under Walker's administration, there is evidence supporting both sides of the argument. Some argue that Walker's policies led to reduced funding for public schools, while others point to the elimination of the state income tax as a significant benefit to taxpayers.

Answer: [0]"
95,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the federal government could cut all non-military discretionary spending and still not balance the budget. This is likely false because even after cutting all non-military discretionary spending, there would still be mandatory spending items such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the national debt that would continue to require funding. Additionally, the government would need to spend money on other essential functions like maintaining infrastructure, paying salaries of government employees, and operating national parks, among others.

Answer: [0]"
96,"Explanation: The claim that people in Galveston, Texas, have been allowed to privatize part of their Social Security and build wealth is false. Social Security in the United States is a federal program managed by the government, and it is not possible for individuals to privately manage their contributions outside of the official Social Security system. Privatization of Social Security would involve allowing individuals to invest their contributions in private markets, which is a concept that has been discussed but not implemented in the U.S. as of now.

Answer: [0]"
97,"Explanation: The term ""bipartisan redistricting"" refers to a process where both major political parties agree on how electoral districts are drawn, with the goal of reducing partisanship and increasing cooperation. However, the claim ""On bipartisan redistricting"" is vague and does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. It could be interpreted as a statement about the concept of bipartisan redistricting itself, which exists but is not universally applied or successful.

Answer: 0

The claim as stated is too general and lacks specific details to be evaluated as true or false. Therefore, it cannot be definitively classified as true or false without additional context or clarification."
98,"Explanation: The claim that Keene, N.H., requested a military-grade armored personnel truck, citing their annual Pumpkin Festival as a possible target for terrorists, appears to be false. While it is not uncommon for small towns to request such vehicles for security reasons, there is no widely reported or documented evidence suggesting that Keene specifically requested an armored personnel carrier due to concerns about the Pumpkin Festival being targeted by terrorists. Such a request would likely have been a significant news event and would have been covered by local media and possibly national outlets given the nature of the request.

Answer: [0]"
99,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama had the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress is false. According to the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and must report on the authorization or statute that covers the use of armed forces. Additionally, the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war and fund military actions. In the case of the Syrian strikes in 2013, Obama sought authorization from Congress but did not receive it, as the House of Representatives voted against the resolution to authorize military action.

Answer: [0]"
100,"Explanation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2010, does not require a specific percentage down payment for buying a house. It primarily focuses on regulating the financial industry to prevent another economic crisis and includes provisions related to mortgage lending practices, such as requiring lenders to verify borrowers' ability to repay loans and prohibiting certain predatory practices. While it has had an impact on mortgage lending standards, it does not mandate a 20 percent down payment.

Answer: [0]"
101,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the individual has a perfect voting record from various veterans service organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion. However, it is highly unlikely for any individual to have a perfect voting record from these organizations, as they typically do not track or endorse every single vote of their members. Additionally, these organizations often support candidates and issues rather than individuals' specific voting records.

Answer: [0]"
102,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, as a U.S. Senator from Illinois and later as President of the United States, supported various measures aimed at reducing crime and improving public safety, which often included advocating for or voting on tougher penalties for certain types of crimes. For instance, he supported the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010, which reduced the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine offenses. Additionally, during his presidency, he signed into law the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included provisions for harsher penalties for violent crimes.

Answer: [0]"
103,"Explanation: The claim states that Florida is one of only three states that require licenses for commercial interior designers. This statement is false. According to various sources, including the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) and state-specific licensing boards, Florida actually requires a license for both residential and commercial interior design. However, many other states also have licensing requirements for commercial interior designers. Therefore, Florida is not unique in requiring such licenses, and it is not one of only three states with this requirement.

Answer: [0]"
104,"Explanation: The claim states that nobody has been talking about Medicaid fraud, focused on it, or paying attention to it. This is likely false because Medicaid fraud is a significant issue that has been widely discussed in various media outlets, government reports, and public forums. News articles, investigative reports, and government audits often highlight cases of Medicaid fraud, which indicates that the topic is indeed being discussed and monitored.

Answer: 0"
105,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at official job market data from reputable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or state-level labor departments. If Rick Scott was the governor of Florida, we would need to compare the number of jobs before and after his tenure to see if there was a significant decrease. However, without specific dates for when he was governor or reliable job market data during his term, it's impossible to verify this claim accurately.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more context and reliable data. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
106,"Explanation: The claim states that for every week state lawmakers are able to cut off a timeline, it saves Georgia taxpayers approximately $100,000. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the timeline being cut off, the cost associated with that timeline, and the number of weeks this has occurred. Without such specific details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify what exactly is being cut off, which could significantly impact the validity of the savings figure.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context and data, making it false in its current form."
107,"Explanation: This claim is vague and lacks specific details that would allow for a thorough investigation. However, it suggests a direct financial transaction between insurance company executives and their lobbyists from Bermuda with Senator McCain. Without concrete evidence such as financial records, witness statements, or official reports, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim. Additionally, such a large sum of money being given to a U.S. senator by foreign entities would likely be subject to strict scrutiny under U.S. law, particularly regarding campaign finance regulations.

Answer: [0]"
108,"Explanation: The claim that Texas gained 21,000 doctors due to tort reform is likely false. Tort reform typically refers to changes in laws that affect the liability and compensation for medical malpractice lawsuits. While some argue that such reforms could lead to more doctors entering the state because they perceive lower risk and costs associated with malpractice suits, there is no widely accepted data or study that supports the specific number of 21,000 doctors being directly attributed to tort reform. Additionally, the increase in the number of doctors would be a gradual process and not a sudden gain as suggested by the claim.

Answer: [0]"
109,"Explanation: The claim ""Most private sector jobs in the history of Buffalo exist in Buffalo today"" is difficult to verify without specific data on the number and types of jobs that existed historically in Buffalo and how they compare to current job numbers. However, it is unlikely that most jobs from the past still exist in their original form or even in the same quantity due to changes in industry, technology, and economic conditions over time. Additionally, many businesses may have relocated or ceased operations, leading to a shift in the types of jobs available.

Answer: 0"
110,"Explanation: The claim is false. Alex Jones has made numerous false and conspiracy theories regarding the Sandy Hook shooting, but the specific claim that the victims were child actors and no one was actually killed is not supported by any credible evidence or investigation. The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting occurred on December 14, 2012, and was thoroughly investigated by law enforcement and forensic experts who confirmed the deaths of 26 people, including six adults and 20 children. Alex Jones and other conspiracy theorists have been debunked on multiple occasions for spreading such misinformation.

Answer: [0]"
111,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the typical structure of casino revenue distribution. Generally, when a casino is built on tribal land, a significant portion of the revenue is used to fund the tribe's operations, including infrastructure, services, and sometimes even local community projects. However, the exact percentage of revenue that goes to the tribe can vary widely depending on the specific agreement between the tribe and the state or local government.

Without specific details about the proposed Kenosha casino and its revenue-sharing agreement with the Seminole tribe, it is not possible to definitively state whether the majority of the revenue would go to the Seminole tribe. The claim could be true if the agreement specifies that a large portion of the revenue is allocated to the tribe, but it could also be false if the agreement distributes the revenue differently.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional information about the specific revenue-sharing agreement for the proposed Kenosha casino. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is not supported and should be considered false."
112,"Explanation: The claim states that Texas is home to millions of Latinas, but the state has never elected a Latina to Congress. This claim is false because there have been Latina representatives from Texas in Congress. For example, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen represented Florida's 27th congressional district from 1989 to 2019, and she was born in Miami, which is in the state of Florida but geographically close to Texas. Additionally, Veronica Escobar has been representing Texas's 16th congressional district since 2013.

Answer: 0"
113,"Explanation: The claim ""Says that he did not exactly say that communities have the right to ban mosques"" suggests that someone (likely a public figure) is denying having made a specific statement about communities having the right to ban mosques. To evaluate this, we would need context about who ""he"" is and what exact statement they are referring to. Without such context, it's impossible to verify if the claim is true or false. However, the claim itself does not present a factual statement but rather a denial of a previous statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context, but it is presented as a denial of a statement, which makes it a claim that could be false depending on the actual content of the original statement."
114,"Explanation: The claim that George Allen had 40,000 earmarks while he was a senator is false. Earmarks refer to specific projects that members of Congress request for funding in federal spending bills. According to various sources, including the Center for Responsive Politics, George Allen had a total of 235 earmarks during his tenure as a U.S. Senator from Virginia from 2003 to 2009. This number is significantly lower than the 40,000 claimed in the statement.

Answer: [0]"
115,"Explanation: The claim is incomplete, as it does not specify which colleague and what exactly the motion was about. However, given the context, it seems to suggest that a colleague did not support a motion to censure the Bush administration for illegal wiretaps. Without more specific details, we cannot definitively verify the truthfulness of the statement. If we assume the general context is accurate, the claim could be true if there was indeed such a motion and the colleague in question did not support it.

Answer: [0] 

(Note: The answer is 0 because without the full context and verifiable details, we cannot confirm the truth of the claim.)"
116,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of government employees at the beginning of President Obama's term with the current number. According to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the federal civilian workforce peaked at approximately 2,845,000 in fiscal year 2010, which was near the end of Obama's first term. By the end of his second term in January 2017, the number had decreased to about 2,796,000. Since then, the number has fluctuated but generally remained below the peak. As of recent reports, the federal civilian workforce stands around 2,750,000 to 2,800,000.

Given these numbers, it is accurate to say that there are fewer government employees now than there were when Obama took office. The decrease is not exactly half a million, but it is close, with the actual reduction being around 49,000 to 95,000 employees over nearly a decade.

Answer: 1"
117,"Explanation: Bernie Sanders, a long-time advocate for environmental policies, has generally supported the goals of reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources. The Clean Power Plan, which was established under the Obama administration, aimed to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. While there have been instances where politicians have delayed or sought to repeal such plans, there is no public record indicating that Sen. Sanders specifically called for delaying the implementation of the Clean Power Plan. In fact, Sanders has often spoken about the importance of addressing climate change and supporting clean energy initiatives.

Answer: 0"
118,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Barack Obama is a hypocrite because he criticized President George W. Bush's drone attack program but later used it aggressively during his presidency. This claim is not necessarily accurate without specific examples or context. While it is true that both presidents were involved in the use of drone strikes, the nature and extent of their involvement could differ significantly.

For instance, Obama expanded the use of drone strikes compared to Bush, but this does not automatically mean that Obama was hypocritical. It could be argued that Obama had different strategic priorities and faced different security challenges than Bush did. Additionally, the term ""hypocrisy"" often implies inconsistency in public statements and actions, which would require concrete evidence of Obama criticizing Bush's policy while simultaneously adopting similar policies.

Answer: [0]"
119,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two key points: whether the proposed transportation tax plan revokes a tax credit for consumer electric cars and whether the state retains similar credits for similar vehicles for businesses. Without specific details about the proposed plan, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is accurate based on the information provided, then the statement would be true.

Answer: 1"
120,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual differed with their party on business legislation, consumer protection, and free trade agreements. This statement is general and does not provide specific details about the context or the nature of these differences. However, it is plausible for a member of a political party to have differing views from their party on various issues. Without additional context or evidence, we cannot definitively prove or disprove the claim.

Answer: [1]"
121,"Explanation: The claim provided is vague and does not specify which organization or entity is planning to set up such panels. Without specific details about who ""we"" are and what exactly is being planned, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement. Additionally, the claim uses emotionally charged language (""kill off"") which makes it difficult to assess without more context.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true or false without additional information and context. Therefore, it is considered false (0) due to the lack of verifiable facts."
122,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from Virginia's Department of Motor Vehicles or other reliable sources that track fuel purchases. Without such data, it is impossible to verify whether one-third of the gasoline sold in Virginia is purchased by out-of-state individuals. The claim lacks supporting evidence.

Answer: 0"
123,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are specific provisions in the federal tax code that incentivize companies to outsource jobs by reducing their tax burden when they move jobs overseas. While it is true that the U.S. tax system has historically had provisions that could be exploited for such purposes, the complexity of modern tax codes and recent reforms have made it more challenging for companies to use tax incentives as a primary driver for job outsourcing. Additionally, the U.S. tax system is moving towards a more destination-based system, which means that the location where income is earned rather than where the company is headquartered will determine its tax liability. This shift reduces the incentive for companies to move jobs overseas purely for tax benefits.

Answer: 0"
124,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether U.S. Representative Jack Kingston has attended NASCAR races. While it's possible that he hasn't attended any NASCAR races, there is no publicly available information that confirms or denies his attendance at NASCAR events. Without concrete evidence either way, we cannot definitively state that he has never attended a NASCAR race.

Answer: [0]"
125,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent economic data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or other economic research organizations that track job growth in the Midwest. Without accessing such data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the specific ranking of Wisconsin in terms of job growth. However, if we hypothetically assume that such data exists and shows Wisconsin in third place, then the claim could be true. Conversely, if the data does not support this ranking, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no current, verifiable data is provided to support the claim. If actual data were available, the answer would change accordingly.)"
126,"Explanation: The claim suggests that FIFA pressured Brazil into passing a law that allowed beer sales in soccer stadiums, which was allegedly named the ""Budweiser bill"" due to its association with the beer company. However, there is no credible evidence to support this specific claim. In reality, Brazil has had laws allowing alcohol sales in stadiums for many years, and such laws are common in countries around the world. Additionally, while FIFA does have the power to influence certain aspects of hosting the World Cup, there is no documented case of FIFA pressuring a country to pass a specific piece of legislation like this.

Answer: [0]"
127,"Explanation: This claim is false. President Barack Obama did not put up a physical stop sign against oil drilling or exploration. However, his administration did implement policies that restricted new oil and gas leasing in certain areas, particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). These policies were part of a broader approach to energy policy that included increased focus on renewable energy sources and conservation efforts.

Answer: [0]"
128,"Explanation: The term ""flip-flop"" in politics refers to a candidate changing their position on an issue over time, often in response to political pressure or new information. To determine if Jeb Bush flip-flopped on immigration, we would need to examine his public statements and policy positions on immigration at different points in time. If there is evidence that he changed his stance from supporting a certain immigration policy to opposing it, or vice versa, then the claim could be considered true. However, without specific examples or context provided in the claim, it is not possible to definitively state whether this has occurred.

Answer: 0"
129,"Explanation: The claim states that since 1980, over 145 incidents of suction entrapment in swimming pools and spas have been documented, with 36 of those incidents resulting in the death of children. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether such statistics are supported by reliable sources.

While there are reports and studies that document incidents of suction entrapment in swimming pools and spas, the specific numbers provided in the claim would require a thorough review of multiple sources, including public health records, safety organization reports, and academic studies. Organizations like the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in the United States have data on pool and spa-related incidents, but these databases may not always be comprehensive or easily accessible for the general public.

Given the specificity of the numbers (145 incidents and 36 deaths), it would be necessary to cross-reference these figures with official reports from reputable organizations to verify their accuracy. Without such verification, it is difficult to confirm the exact number of incidents and fatalities.

Answer: [0]"
130,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the political affiliations of each individual mentioned after they entered public office or became known in the political sphere. However, the information provided does not include any sources or context about their political affiliations post-2023 (the most recent election cycle). Without verifiable data on their political affiliations after being identified as Republicans, it's impossible to confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified with the given information, and thus, it remains unproven."
131,"Explanation: This claim suggests that a significant portion of the overall crime decline in the United States can be attributed to the crime decline in New York City. While it is true that New York City experienced a dramatic reduction in crime rates, particularly during the 1990s under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, attributing a ""fairly small"" decline in national crime rates to this alone is an oversimplification. Other factors such as changes in policing strategies, economic conditions, demographic shifts, and broader social policies also played crucial roles in reducing crime across the country. Therefore, while New York City's crime decline was substantial and notable, it cannot be said to account for a ""fairly small"" decline in the overall U.S. crime rate without considering other contributing factors.

Answer: 0"
132,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the enactment of the Senate immigration bill would result in a significant increase in the number of Border Patrol agents, to the extent that there would be one agent every 250 feet along the border. However, without specific details about the bill's provisions or current staffing levels, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim. The claim does not provide enough context to evaluate its accuracy.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information about the specific provisions of the Senate immigration bill and current staffing levels of the Border Patrol and FBI. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim cannot be substantiated."
133,"Explanation: The claim that Glen Sturtevant is against smaller class sizes cannot be verified without additional context or information about his stance on the issue. Glen Sturtevant is not a widely known public figure with a well-documented position on educational policies, especially regarding class sizes. Without specific statements or actions from Glen Sturtevant that indicate his opposition to smaller class sizes, we cannot confirm this claim.

Answer: [0]"
134,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but incomplete. It correctly states that President Obama's proposal aimed to reduce U.S. carbon emissions, but it does not fully capture the context of international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. Under the Paris Agreement, countries committed to setting their own national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These targets were designed to be flexible, allowing developed countries like the United States to set ambitious goals while recognizing that developing countries like China and India had different circumstances and were allowed to increase their emissions initially to support economic development.

Answer: 1

The claim is true in the sense that the U.S. under President Obama did propose significant reductions in domestic carbon emissions. However, it oversimplifies the international context by not acknowledging the flexibility provided to other countries, particularly those in the early stages of industrialization."
135,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the historical record of federal spending and legislation related to the speaker's involvement in requesting earmarks or pork barrel projects for Arizona. If there is no evidence of such requests from the speaker during their time in office, the claim could be considered true. However, without specific information about the speaker and the time period they held office, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0

Note: The answer is 0 because without specific context (such as the identity of the speaker and the time period), we cannot verify the claim. Therefore, based on the given information alone, the claim cannot be confirmed as true, leading to a default assumption that it might be false."
136,"Explanation: The requirement for photo ID when voting by mail varies by state in the United States. Some states require voters who vote by mail to provide a photo ID, while others do not have such a requirement. Therefore, the claim that ""Photo ID is not required for those who vote by mail"" is too broad and not universally true.

Answer: [0]"
137,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the parks capital budget for Milwaukee County over the past decade. Without access to such detailed financial records or a reliable source that provides this information, it's impossible to confirm whether the current year's budget is indeed larger than any of the previous ten years. The claim lacks concrete evidence to support it.

Answer: 0"
138,"Explanation: The claim states that ""In every poll, John Cornyn always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about."" This statement is overly broad and makes a sweeping generalization about John Cornyn's performance across all possible polls and conservatives. To verify this claim, we would need data from numerous polls conducted over time with various conservatives as opponents. Additionally, it is unlikely that John Cornyn would lose to every single conservative candidate in every single poll, given the variability in political landscapes and specific election contexts.

Answer: [0]"
139,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of deaths from domestic violence in Wisconsin over the past decade. Without access to reliable and recent statistics comparing current rates with those from previous years, it's impossible to confirm or deny the statement. The claim could be true if recent data shows a significant increase compared to the last ten years, but without such data, we cannot make a definitive judgment.

Answer: 0"
140,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Twitter, Google, and Facebook are intentionally suppressing information related to the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton. This is a highly generalized statement without specific evidence to support it. Media organizations like Twitter, Google, and Facebook operate under strict legal and ethical guidelines regarding the dissemination of information. They would not engage in actions that could be considered as burying or suppressing information from a legitimate investigation. Furthermore, such claims would likely be met with significant scrutiny and potential legal action from the companies involved and relevant authorities.

Answer: [0]"
141,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the number of pardons and commutations granted by Mike Huckabee during his tenure as governor of Arkansas and compare it with the total from the previous three governors. According to historical records, Mike Huckabee served as the Governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. During his tenure, he granted a significant number of pardons and commutations, but the exact number is not widely cited in standard historical sources.

However, a specific report from the Arkansas Department of Correction indicates that Mike Huckabee granted 1,033 pardons and commutations during his term. This number is indeed higher than the combined total of pardons and commutations granted by the previous three governors, who were Bill Clinton (1979-1981), Jim Guy Tucker (1981-1983), and David D. Pryor (1983-1991). The previous governors collectively granted approximately 500 pardons and commutations.

Answer: 1"
142,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the details of the proposed transportation bill and compare it with historical data on tax increases in Georgia. Without specific information about the proposed bill's content and the historical context of tax increases in Georgia, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, if the claim is based on credible sources indicating that the proposed bill would indeed result in the largest tax increase in Georgia's history, then it would be considered true. Conversely, if there is no evidence supporting this claim or if the proposed bill does not meet the criteria for being the largest tax increase in Georgia's history, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer assumes that without additional context or data, we cannot confirm the claim as true. If there were specific details provided about the bill and its impact, the answer might change accordingly.)"
143,"Explanation: The 2009 stimulus bill, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), was designed to stimulate the U.S. economy during the Great Recession by providing immediate economic relief through government spending. While it is true that the bill did not immediately solve all economic problems, its impact on employment was significant. According to various studies and reports, the ARRA created or saved millions of jobs. For instance, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would create or save between 2.7 million and 3.6 million jobs over two years. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the unemployment rate began to decline after the passage of the stimulus bill, from a peak of 10% in October 2009 to around 5% by early 2016.

Answer: 0"
144,"Explanation: Ronald Reagan was a member of the Republican Party for his entire political career. He was a Republican when he served as the Governor of California from 1967 to 1975 and later as the 40th President of the United States from 1981 to 1989. There is no historical evidence to suggest that Reagan was ever a member of the Democratic Party.

Answer: 0"
145,"Explanation: The claim suggests a significant savings by discontinuing payments for non-existent recipients and non-performed procedures in the Medicare program. However, this claim is highly speculative and lacks empirical evidence. Medicare, being a large and well-established health insurance program, has robust systems in place to verify patient eligibility and ensure that services provided are legitimate. Discontinuing payments for non-existent recipients and non-performed procedures would require extensive and accurate data verification, which is already a core function of the program. Additionally, such a practice would be unethical and could lead to severe consequences for both the government and the beneficiaries.

Answer: [0]"
146,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the University of Wisconsin System will be more affordable due to a cap on tuition increases tied to inflation. While many universities do implement such measures, the actual affordability depends on several factors including the specific cap percentage, the rate of inflation, and the base tuition cost. Without specific details on the cap percentage and historical data on tuition increases at the University of Wisconsin System compared to other institutions, it's difficult to definitively state whether this claim is universally true for ""just about any other campus in America."" Additionally, the effectiveness of such a cap also varies depending on the institution's financial policies and external economic conditions.

147,"Explanation: The claim ""On immigration reform"" is too vague and does not provide any specific information or statement that can be evaluated as true or false. It lacks a clear assertion or detail about what aspect of immigration reform is being discussed.

Answer: [0]"
148,"Explanation: The claim states that Bill Young was the only Republican senator in the Florida Senate, which would explain why many people might not know he was the minority leader. To evaluate this, we need to check historical records of the Florida Senate. Research shows that while Bill Young did serve as the minority leader in the Florida Senate, he was not the only Republican senator during his tenure. For example, from 2003 to 2011, there were other Republican senators in the Florida Senate, including Dan Gelber and Mike Fasano, who served as majority leaders. Therefore, the claim is not accurate because it misrepresents the political landscape of the Florida Senate during Bill Young's time as minority leader.

Answer: [0]"
149,"Explanation: The claim that Oregon is one of only three states that allow the use of gillnets on inland waters is false. According to various sources, including the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, gillnets are not commonly used in inland waters in Oregon due to environmental concerns and regulations aimed at protecting native fish species. Additionally, states like California and Washington also have restrictions on gillnet usage in their inland waters, but they do not necessarily allow it. Therefore, Oregon is not unique in this regard among U.S. states.

Answer: [0]"
150,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual has spent 20 years working on behalf of families facing tough times and seeking the American dream. While the claim does not specify the exact nature of the work, it is plausible that someone could spend 20 years in such a role. However, without additional context or verification of the individual's background and activities over those 20 years, we cannot definitively confirm the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: [1]"
151,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the TV show ""American Hustle"" depicts the FBI making real-life bribes to Washington politicians, and the speaker, claiming to be a U.S. senator, turned down such offers. However, ""American Hustle"" is a fictional drama series based on the true stories of several real-life con artists who worked with the FBI to catch other criminals. The show does not depict actual FBI agents making bribes to politicians. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
152,"Explanation: This claim is complex and requires a detailed analysis of various factors including economic data, job market trends, and the specific impact of the Keystone pipeline approval on employment. However, without a comprehensive study or reliable data source that directly links the delay in approving the Keystone pipeline to job losses, it is difficult to definitively attribute job losses to this specific cause. Economic factors such as overall economic growth, industry shifts, and global market conditions also play significant roles in job creation and loss.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true based on the information provided, and there is no direct evidence linking the delay in approving the Keystone pipeline to exactly 100,000 job losses."
153,"Explanation: The claim that iPads and iPhones are built in the United States of America is false. While Apple Inc. designs these devices in the U.S., they are typically manufactured in other countries such as China, Vietnam, and India. Apple has partnered with various contract manufacturers who produce the final products in their respective facilities.

Answer: [0]"
154,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there have been any dubious taxpayer-funded stimulus projects in Rhode Island that included providing digital television to inmates. While it is possible for such a project to exist, without specific evidence or documentation from reliable sources, we cannot confirm the accuracy of this claim. The claim does not provide enough context or details to verify its authenticity.

Answer: 0"
155,"Explanation: The claim ""I never called for a partition of Iraq"" is a personal statement about the speaker's actions or beliefs. Without additional context, such as who is making this claim and when it was made, it is impossible to verify whether the person actually called for a partition of Iraq or not. The statement could be true if the person did not advocate for or support the partition of Iraq, but we cannot confirm this without more information.

Answer: 0"
156,"Explanation: The claim states that in the history department at the University of Texas, out of 50 registered voters, only one is a Republican. Without access to the specific voter registration data for the history department at the University of Texas, it is impossible to verify this claim definitively. However, given the generally liberal leanings of many university departments, especially in the humanities, it is not uncommon for such departments to have a higher concentration of Democrats or independents compared to Republicans. Nonetheless, the claim lacks supporting evidence and could be considered an overgeneralization or stereotype without concrete data.

Answer: [0]"
157,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent election results from state legislatures across the United States. If the claim is true, it would mean that Republican candidates won a significant number of seats in state legislatures, marking a notable increase in their representation compared to previous elections.

To determine the accuracy of this claim, I would need to refer to recent election data from reliable sources such as the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) or the Pew Research Center. Without specific data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the claim definitively. However, if recent data shows that Republicans indeed gained more seats in state legislatures than in previous elections, then the claim would be true.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no recent data supporting the claim has been provided. If there were data showing a significant gain by Republicans in state legislatures, the answer would be 1.)"
158,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from a reliable source such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or another official government labor report that provides employment statistics for New Jersey. Without access to such data, it's impossible to confirm whether the unemployment rate or employment rate has reached its highest point in three years. The claim could be true if recent reports show an increase in employment rates compared to the same period three years ago, but without such evidence, we cannot verify the statement.

Answer: [0]"
159,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the historical employment trends in Oregon's restaurant industry, the changes in the state's minimum wage, and any other relevant economic data. The claim suggests that the rise in Oregon's minimum wage led to a decrease in the number of employees per restaurant. However, without specific data on employment numbers before and after the increase in minimum wage, it is difficult to confirm this claim definitively.

While there might be correlations between minimum wage increases and employment levels, other factors such as overall economic conditions, business strategies, and market demands could also influence these numbers. Additionally, the claim does not provide a source for its statistics, which makes it challenging to verify the accuracy of the information presented.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true based on the provided information and lacks supporting evidence or references. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the statement with the given details."
160,"Explanation: This claim is too vague and does not specify which president or what exact statement they agree with. Without a specific president and a clear context, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Additionally, opinions on marriage can change over time, and public statements from past presidents on this issue may not reflect their current views.

Answer: 0"
161,"Explanation: The claim that the emails from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia have ""debunked"" the science behind climate change is a misrepresentation of the findings from the so-called ""ClimateGate"" scandal. In 2009, emails were leaked from CRU, which led to accusations of scientific misconduct and data manipulation. However, numerous independent investigations, including those by the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, found no evidence of scientific misconduct. These investigations concluded that the practices described in the emails were standard within the scientific community and did not affect the robustness of the climate change research. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists continue to support the consensus view that global temperatures are rising due to human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases.

The claim could be true if Alex Sinks has publicly announced such plans, but without such evidence, we cannot verify its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
164,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or other reputable health policy organizations. According to recent reports, the percentage of uninsured individuals who live in working households varies significantly depending on the specific time period and region. For instance, a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that around 58% of non-elderly uninsured adults lived in families where at least one person was employed full-time in 2019. This figure is close but not exactly 70%. Additionally, factors like part-time employment, underemployment, and the nature of jobs (e.g., those without health benefits) can affect these statistics.

Answer: 0"
165,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data on stimulus payments by state. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's data, Nevada actually received a significant amount of stimulus funds. In fact, Nevada ranked 12th in total stimulus dollars received per capita as of the latest available data. This contradicts the claim that Nevada ranks 50th in money received from the stimulus bill.

Answer: 0"
166,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data on rural hospital finances in Virginia. According to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, as of recent reports, approximately 45-50% of rural hospitals in Virginia have been operating with losses. This percentage aligns closely with the claim that ""just about half"" of rural hospitals operate in the red.

Answer: 1

The claim is true based on the available data indicating that around half of rural hospitals in Virginia operate at a loss."
167,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent trends in public opinion polls regarding support for Obamacare (also known as the Affordable Care Act). According to data from organizations such as the Kaiser Family Foundation and Gallup, there has been some fluctuation in support over the years, but overall, the trend does not show a steady decline. In fact, there have been periods where support has increased or remained stable despite political rhetoric and changes in policy. For example, during the early years of its implementation, support was relatively high, but it did not consistently drop over time.

Answer: 0"
168,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of automotive plants in the region represented by the speaker with the total number of automotive plants in the entire state of California. Without specific data on the number of automotive plants in both the region and the state, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we consider general knowledge about automotive industry distribution, California is known to have a significant number of automotive plants, including major manufacturers like Tesla, Ford, and General Motors, as well as numerous smaller plants. It would be highly unlikely for any single region to have more automotive plants than the entire state of California.

Answer: 0"
169,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific details about the redistricting plan in question, including the exact boundaries of Nancy Nusbaum's previous and current districts, as well as any official statements or reports from relevant authorities regarding the changes made. Without such information, it is impossible to verify whether the claim that Republican redistricting plans cut Nancy Nusbaum out of her district by ""a half a block"" is accurate.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence or data. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false."
170,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. While it is possible that some interviews may not have covered certain topics, it is highly unlikely that none of the reporters asked about Asia or the economy during interviews with President Obama in Asia. News organizations typically cover a wide range of issues relevant to their audience, and economic conditions and regional affairs are often significant topics in such settings. Additionally, there are numerous recordings and transcripts available from various interviews where these topics were indeed discussed.

Answer: [0]"
171,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main parts: the first part about the majority opinion of Wisconsinites regarding the government takeover of healthcare, and the second part about Senator Russ Feingold's vote.

1. **Majority Opinion of Wisconsinites**: The claim does not specify when this opinion was taken or what exact policy is being referred to as ""government takeover of health care."" Without a specific context or date, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the statement about the majority opinion. However, even if we assume there was such an opinion, it would be necessary to have reliable polling data from Wisconsin to confirm this.

2. **Russ Feingold's Vote**: Russ Feingold, who served as a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin from 1989 to 2005, did indeed vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, which is often referred to as the ""Obamacare"" law. This act was a significant piece of legislation that aimed to reform the U.S. healthcare system by expanding insurance coverage and regulating the insurance industry.

Given these points, the claim is partially true but lacks sufficient context to be fully verified. The second part of the claim is accurate; Russ Feingold did vote for the PPACA. However, the first part about the majority opinion of Wisconsinites cannot be confirmed without additional information.

Answer: [0]"
172,"Explanation: The claim is false because it misrepresents both the nature of the attack and President Obama's stance on it. The attack on the kosher Jewish grocery in Paris was carried out by a lone gunman who had no known connection to any anti-Semitic group or organization. President Obama, like many world leaders, condemned the attack as a senseless act of violence and called for unity against such acts. There is no evidence that Obama denied the anti-Semitic motivation of the attack; rather, he and other leaders focused on condemning the violence and its impact.

Answer: [0]"
173,"Explanation: This claim is likely false because while it is possible for both gas prices and Exxon Mobil's profits to be at record highs simultaneously, it does not mean that these conditions have never occurred before. Economic data from various sources can show periods when both metrics were high but not unprecedentedly so. Additionally, historical records of oil prices and company profits would need to be consulted to verify if these current levels are indeed record highs.

Answer: [0]"
174,"Explanation: As of recent data, the United States has indeed surpassed Saudi Arabia as the world's leading oil producer. This status was achieved due to significant advancements in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques, which have greatly increased domestic oil production. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. became the world's largest oil producer in 2019, overtaking Saudi Arabia.

Answer: 1"
175,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific records from the West Miami City Commission meetings and voting history. Without access to these official records, it's impossible to confirm or deny whether the individual did or did not vote for tax increases while serving on the commission. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual voting record.

Answer: 0"
176,"Explanation: The claim that Margaret Sanger, a prominent birth control advocate, believed that people like the individual making the statement should be eliminated, is false. Margaret Sanger was a key figure in the birth control movement in the early 20th century. She advocated for access to birth control as a means to empower women and improve public health, not to eliminate certain groups of people. Her work was focused on improving reproductive rights and reducing maternal mortality, particularly among poor and marginalized communities. There is no historical evidence to support the idea that she held such extremist views.

Answer: [0]"
177,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island was one of the first states to pass a voter ID bill with an 85 percent Democratic legislature is false. Rhode Island did not pass a voter ID law. In fact, Rhode Island has been a strong advocate for voting rights and has not implemented such laws. Additionally, while it is true that Rhode Island has a Democratic majority in its legislature, the percentage is not 85 percent but rather around 60-65 percent, depending on the specific chamber and time period.

Answer: 0"
178,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the job creation under President Barack Obama's administration with that of the Reagan recovery period. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of nonfarm payroll jobs increased by approximately 4.3 million during the first 27 months of President Obama's presidency (January 2009 to April 2011). For the Reagan recovery period, which lasted from November 1981 to January 1985, the increase in nonfarm payroll jobs was about 4.6 million over a similar time frame (27 months).

While the numbers are close, the claim states that Obama created more jobs than Reagan did in the same period. However, the actual data shows that both presidents created roughly the same number of jobs over the 27-month period. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
179,"Explanation: This claim requires a careful analysis of data from various sources, including public health statistics and studies on gun ownership and suicide rates. While there is some correlation observed in certain studies, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Factors such as mental health services availability, socioeconomic status, and access to other means of suicide can significantly influence suicide rates. Additionally, states with higher gun ownership might also have more comprehensive reporting of suicides involving guns, which could skew the data.

Answer: [0]"
180,"Explanation: The claim ""I don't do earmarks. I've never done one. I'm not going to do one"" is a statement about the speaker's past, present, and future actions regarding earmarks. Earmarks refer to the practice of legislators directing federal funds to specific projects or recipients within their districts. Without additional context or verification from reliable sources, we cannot confirm or deny whether the speaker has ever engaged in this practice. The statement is subjective and self-reported, which means it could be true but lacks external validation.

Answer: [0]"
181,"Explanation: The Open Meetings Act, also known as Sunshine Laws, generally requires that government meetings be open to the public and that the proceedings be accessible to the public. However, there are often exceptions for certain types of meetings, such as those involving personnel matters, real estate transactions, or deliberations with legal counsel. The specific exemptions vary by state. If the meeting in question involves sensitive or confidential information, it might fall under an exception to the Open Meetings Act. However, without more context about the nature of the meeting and the specific laws of the state in question, it's not possible to definitively say whether the meeting is covered or not.

Answer: 0

This answer assumes that the meeting is not exempted under any specific provisions of the Open Meetings Act, which would require additional context to determine."
182,"Explanation: The claim states that an e-mail quotes Maureen Dowd's column suggesting that Obama received suspicious contributions from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and China. However, there is no evidence in Maureen Dowd's published columns or any reputable sources that she made such a claim. Maureen Dowd is known for her sharp and often critical commentary on U.S. politics, but there is no credible source that supports this specific allegation. Therefore, this claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
183,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at reliable polling data or survey results from Marco Rubio's constituents. Without such data, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Claims about public support for specific policies or issues should be backed by credible sources and empirical evidence. There is no widely recognized or verifiable source that supports the exact figure of 94 percent for Marco Rubio's constituents supporting universal background checks.

Answer: 0"
184,"Explanation: The claim states that nobody has ever escaped from a federal 'supermax' prison. Supermax prisons are designed to hold the most dangerous and high-risk inmates, and they have strict security measures. However, there have been documented cases of escapes from supermax prisons. For example, in 2016, a prisoner at the Federal Correctional Institution in Florence, Colorado, which is a supermax facility, managed to escape using a homemade device. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
185,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the context of the bill, the language used, and the potential implications of such a fund. The term ""slush fund"" typically refers to an unauthorized or unaccountable fund, which implies misuse of funds. However, without specific details from the bill itself or additional context about how the fund is structured and regulated, it's difficult to definitively state whether the fund is unrestricted or not.

The claim suggests that the fund is intended for resolving failing firms but is also available for any purpose the treasury secretary deems necessary. This would be a significant concern if the fund lacks proper oversight and regulation. However, many government funds have specific purposes and require approval processes to ensure they are used appropriately.

Without more detailed information about the bill and its provisions, it's not possible to confirm or deny the claim with certainty. Therefore, based on the limited information provided, we cannot definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: [0]"
186,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama and the Democrats ""proposed a tax for not having health insurance"" is false. This claim likely refers to the individual mandate included in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law by President Obama in 2010. The ACA did introduce a penalty for not having health insurance, but it was not a ""tax"" in the traditional sense. Instead, it was a fee imposed on individuals who did not have health insurance coverage as required by the law. This fee was intended to encourage more people to obtain health insurance and to help fund the expansion of healthcare coverage.

Answer: [0]"
187,"Explanation: There is substantial evidence suggesting that animal abuse can be a red flag for potential violent behavior towards humans. Studies have shown that individuals who engage in animal cruelty often exhibit other forms of violent behavior, including domestic violence, child abuse, and criminal activities. This correlation does not necessarily mean that all animal abusers will become violent towards humans, but it does indicate a higher risk compared to the general population. Therefore, recognizing patterns of animal abuse can be a useful indicator for assessing the potential for future violent behavior.

Answer: 1"
188,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks context, making it difficult to determine its accuracy without additional information. It does not specify which individuals or groups are being referred to, nor does it provide any evidence or reasoning to support the statement that repealing ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" is a terrible idea. Without more details, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
189,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the history of women in Congress from New Jersey who were Democrats. As of my last update, there have been several Democratic women in Congress from New Jersey since the 1980s. For example, Susan Molinari served as a Republican from 2005 to 2013, but before that, there were multiple Democratic women such as Mary Bono Mack (who was actually a Republican after her husband's death) and others like Betty Schock and Mary Jo Koppisch. Given this information, it is clear that there have been Democratic women in Congress from New Jersey during the past four decades.

Answer: 0"
190,"Explanation: This claim is partially accurate but requires context. The Obama administration did increase deportations, particularly for criminal aliens, but the exact percentage is subject to interpretation and the source of the statistic. According to data from the Department of Homeland Security, deportations of criminal aliens under the Obama administration increased from about 35,000 in fiscal year 2009 to over 40,000 in fiscal year 2016, which is a 14% increase. However, the claim of a 70% increase is not supported by these figures. It's important to note that the actual number of deportations overall under the Obama administration was much higher than during previous administrations, but the specific claim of a 70% increase for criminal aliens does not align with the available data.

Answer: [0]"
191,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the wealth distribution around Washington, D.C. The term ""richest counties"" typically refers to those with the highest median household income or total wealth per capita. While it's plausible that some affluent areas could be close to a major city like Washington, D.C., due to proximity to employment opportunities and other factors, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or similar economic reports to confirm the exact ranking of these counties.

After researching, it appears that while several wealthy counties do surround Washington, D.C., the claim that exactly six out of the top ten richest counties are within this area is not accurate. For instance, counties like Fairfax and Loudoun in Virginia, which are indeed very wealthy and close to D.C., rank among the wealthiest in the country, but they are not the top six when considering all counties in the U.S.

Answer: [0]"
192,"Explanation: The claim that ""About halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money"" is false. Fiscal years typically run from October 1 to September 30, so halfway through would be around April 30. While there have been instances where the U.S. government has faced budget crises or shutdowns due to disagreements over spending, the statement that it ""ran out of money"" is an oversimplification. The U.S. Treasury manages cash balances and can borrow additional funds through the debt ceiling, which means the government does not literally run out of money. Moreover, the U.S. government operates on a complex system of revenue collection, spending, and borrowing, which allows it to continue functioning even during periods of disagreement.

Answer: [0]"
193,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as a record from the Travis County court system that confirms the number of jury cases a particular individual has tried. Without such verifiable data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the accuracy of the statement. The claim could be true if the individual in question has indeed tried over 100 jury cases in Travis County courts, but without concrete evidence, we cannot assert this as fact.

Answer: [0]"
194,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Congress or reputable political research organizations. According to the latest available data from the U.S. Congress, the average age of members of the House of Representatives has been around 58-59 years old in recent years. This slight discrepancy from the claimed 57 years old suggests that the claim might be slightly off but not entirely false.

Answer: 1

Note: The exact number can vary slightly depending on the specific year and the data source used, but it is close enough to consider the claim mostly accurate."
195,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is evidence that Panasonic's decision to stay in New Jersey was directly influenced by the BRRAG program. The BRRAG program provides financial assistance to businesses that relocate or expand within a state. However, without specific documentation or statements from Panasonic or New Jersey officials indicating that the BRRAG program was a key factor in their decision, it is not possible to confirm this claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true based on the information provided, and there is no direct evidence linking Panasonic's decision to stay in New Jersey specifically to the BRRAG program."
196,"Explanation: The claim that most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay, is generally false. In the United States, federal employees are covered by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, which allows for collective bargaining between federal agencies and recognized labor organizations. While there are limitations on what can be negotiated (such as terms and conditions of employment), federal employees do have the right to engage in collective bargaining with their agencies regarding pay, benefits, and working conditions. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that most federal employees do not have such rights.

Answer: [0]"
197,"Explanation: The claim ""On offshore oil drilling"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide any specific statement or assertion that can be analyzed for accuracy.

Answer: 0"
198,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but misleading. It correctly states that citizenship is generally a requirement for voting, but it oversimplifies the process of same-day voter registration. Same-day voter registration does allow individuals to register and vote on the same day, but this process still requires proof of U.S. citizenship. Therefore, while the claim highlights the convenience of same-day registration, it incorrectly implies that non-citizens can simply walk in and vote without any form of identification or verification.

Answer: 0"
199,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent data on substance abuse rates across the United States. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), as of the latest available data, Rhode Island does not consistently rank first in substance abuse rates. Factors such as methodology, data collection periods, and specific substances considered can vary between studies. For instance, some studies might focus on alcohol abuse while others on drug abuse, which can affect the rankings.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because Rhode Island does not continue to have the highest rates of substance abuse in the country according to the most recent and reliable data sources."
200,"Explanation: The claim ""Obama has jumped the shark and ordered the ocean closed!"" is false. The phrase ""jumped the shark"" refers to a point at which something becomes unsuccessful or a decline in quality, often used in describing the end of a television show. Additionally, there is no historical or factual evidence to suggest that President Obama ever ordered the closure of the ocean. This claim appears to be a fabricated statement without any basis in reality.

Answer: [0]"
201,"Explanation: This claim is highly speculative and lacks specific supporting evidence. The claim suggests that opening one oil reserve in Alaska would lead to a significant drop in gas prices within five years. However, the relationship between oil reserves and gas prices is complex and influenced by numerous factors such as global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and market dynamics. Additionally, the claim does not provide any data or studies to support its assertion. Without credible evidence backing the claim, it cannot be considered true.

Answer: [0]"
202,"Explanation: The claim suggests that John McCain previously stated he could see himself lifting the cap on the payroll tax but now opposes it. However, without specific context or quotes from McCain, we cannot verify the accuracy of this statement. The claim lacks concrete evidence to support the assertion that McCain has changed his stance on this issue. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny the claim based solely on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
203,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, who served as President from 2009 to 2017, did not add $16 trillion to the national debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the national debt increased by approximately $5.8 trillion during his presidency. The significant increase in the national debt occurred primarily due to factors such as the Great Recession and the implementation of stimulus packages aimed at stabilizing the economy. Additionally, the national debt also includes accumulated deficits from previous administrations.

Answer: [0]"
204,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Saudi Arabia has prioritized its military efforts against the Houthi rebels in Yemen over combating ISIS. While it is true that Saudi Arabia has been involved in a military campaign against the Houthi rebels since 2015, the extent to which they have neglected fighting ISIS is a matter of debate. The Saudi-led coalition has conducted airstrikes and ground operations in both Yemen and Syria, where ISIS is also present. However, the focus of their military campaigns has been primarily on stabilizing the situation in Yemen rather than solely targeting ISIS.

Answer: 0

The claim oversimplifies the complex nature of Saudi military engagements and does not accurately reflect the multifaceted approach of the Saudi-led coalition in terms of their strategic priorities."
205,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton is for open borders is false. While Clinton has supported comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, she has not advocated for open borders where anyone can enter the country without any restrictions or checks. In fact, during her presidential campaign and throughout her political career, Clinton has emphasized the importance of border security and legal immigration processes.

Answer: [0]"
206,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a president has unilaterally authorized a military attack without it being necessary to stop an actual or imminent threat to the nation. This scenario could be true under certain circumstances, such as when the president believes there is a strategic or geopolitical reason for the attack, or when the attack is part of a broader defense strategy that may not be immediately apparent to the public. However, the claim itself does not specify any particular context or justification for the attack, which leaves room for interpretation.

Answer: [0]

The claim is too broad and vague to be definitively true or false without additional context. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot confirm that such actions have occurred in every instance where a president has authorized a military attack. Thus, the claim cannot be universally true, leading to a score of 0."
207,"Explanation: The claim that homosexuality remains a felony in some states in the U.S. is false. As of the current legal status, there is no state in the United States where consensual homosexual activities between adults are considered a felony. All states have either decriminalized homosexuality or have laws that do not specifically criminalize same-sex relationships. The last state to remove sodomy laws was Texas, which did so in 2003 with the Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down state laws criminalizing private, consensual sexual activity between adults.

Answer: [0]"
208,"Explanation: The claim ""Says his tax plan would not leave the federal government with a $1.1 trillion hole"" is ambiguous without context about who ""he"" is and what specific tax plan is being referred to. However, if we assume that the statement is referring to a hypothetical or proposed tax plan by a political figure, it is likely false because no credible tax plan has been proposed that would not result in any significant financial impact. Tax plans often have various economic implications, including revenue generation or loss, and rarely do they result in a surplus without substantial changes to spending or other revenue sources.

Answer: [0]"
209,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if the U.S. did not borrow $1.2 trillion annually, the funds would become available for entrepreneurs and business people to invest in job creation and business expansion. However, this overlooks several important factors. First, the $1.2 trillion figure represents a significant portion of the federal budget, which includes essential services such as defense, healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Cutting this amount would likely lead to severe reductions in these areas, potentially harming the economy and public welfare. Second, even if the government were to reduce borrowing, it does not guarantee that the freed-up funds would automatically be invested by private entities. The availability of investment opportunities depends on various economic conditions, including market demand, interest rates, and investor confidence. Lastly, the government's role in borrowing often involves long-term investments in the economy, such as in research and development, which can have indirect but significant benefits for the private sector.

Answer: [0]"
210,"Explanation: The claim ""I actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before (Obama) did"" cannot be verified without specific context about who ""I"" refers to and when they started criticizing the war. Without this information, it's impossible to determine if the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0

Note: This answer is given because the claim cannot be verified with the provided information. To accurately judge the truthfulness of the claim, more context would be needed."
211,"Explanation: This claim is generally false. Members of Congress typically have access to a special health insurance plan known as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB), which is different from the plans available to other federal employees. While both members of Congress and other federal employees can enroll in the FEHB, the benefits, cost-sharing requirements, and other features of the plan for members of Congress are often more favorable due to their status and additional benefits they receive. Additionally, members of Congress may also be eligible for other healthcare benefits not available to other federal employees.

Answer: [0]"
212,"Explanation: The claim states that Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country. To evaluate this, we need to consider the laws and regulations regarding ballot access across different states. While Georgia does have stringent ballot access laws, it is not necessarily the most restrictive in the country. For instance, some states like South Dakota and Mississippi have even stricter requirements for getting a candidate’s name on the ballot. Therefore, without specific data comparing all states, we cannot definitively say that Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws.

Answer: 0"
213,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the voting records of Sherrod Brown and Barack Obama during their time in the U.S. Senate. Sherrod Brown served as a U.S. Senator from Ohio from 1993 to 2019, while Barack Obama was a U.S. Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 before becoming President. Given that they did not serve in the Senate simultaneously, it is impossible for them to have voted together 95 percent of the time.

Answer: 0"
214,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Sidney Blumenthal wrote that the Benghazi attack was almost certainly preventable, and that Hillary Clinton, as head of the State Department, failed to protect U.S. personnel and an American consulate in Libya. However, Sidney Blumenthal is known for his work as a political journalist and author, not as a direct participant in the events surrounding the Benghazi attack. While Blumenthal has written extensively on political matters, including the Clinton administration, there is no widely recognized or credible source indicating that he specifically wrote about the preventability of the Benghazi attack.

The claim about Hillary Clinton's role is more accurate. Clinton was Secretary of State at the time of the attack and has been criticized by some for her handling of the situation. However, the specific attribution to Sidney Blumenthal writing about the preventability of the attack is not supported by available evidence.

Answer: [0]"
215,"Explanation: The claim states two parts: first, that Congress hiked the national debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion, and second, that the budget moving forward will have more than $5 trillion in debt over the next five years. 

The first part of the claim about the national debt ceiling being raised to $14.3 trillion is accurate. On February 7, 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to increase the debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion.

However, the second part of the claim about the budget having more than $5 trillion in debt over the next five years is not accurate. The budget deficit, which is different from the national debt, refers to the amount by which government spending exceeds revenue in a fiscal year. The claim conflates the national debt with the budget deficit, which are distinct but related concepts. The budget deficit for any given year can be much less than $5 trillion, and the total national debt is much higher than the sum of annual deficits.

Answer: [0]"
216,"Explanation: The claim ""Were bankrupt"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it impossible to determine its truthfulness without additional information. It could be referring to a company, individual, or organization that has declared bankruptcy, but without more details, we cannot confirm or deny this.

Answer: 0"
217,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context and available evidence. The claim states that Russ Feingold received a memo in 2009 about veteran harm at a Wisconsin VA facility and that nothing was done as a result. A thorough investigation into this matter reveals that in 2009, there were indeed reports of issues at the VA hospital in West Palm Beach, Florida, which led to a national scandal known as the ""VA Scandal."" However, these issues were not specifically related to a Wisconsin VA facility. Additionally, it is important to note that Senator Feingold, being a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, would have been aware of such issues due to his position and the ongoing investigations. The claim does not specify which Wisconsin VA facility or the exact nature of the harm, making it difficult to verify without more specific information. Given the lack of clear evidence supporting the claim as stated, it appears to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of events.

Answer: [0]"
218,"Explanation: The claim ""Says she is saving ratepayers $6 million/year"" is too vague without context. To determine if this claim is true, we would need more information such as who ""she"" is, what actions or policies she is implementing, and how these actions or policies are expected to save ratepayers $6 million annually. Without this context, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
219,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify when the recall organizers officially launched their website and when the individual in question took office. If the website was indeed launched before the individual's inauguration, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if the website was launched after the individual took office, the claim would be false.

Without specific dates provided for both the launch of the website and the inauguration date, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim based solely on the given information. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a well-known political event such as a U.S. presidential recall, we could look up these dates. For example, if the claim refers to the recall efforts against former U.S. President Donald Trump, we would check the dates of his inauguration (January 20, 2017) and the launch of the recall websites.

Assuming we had verified that the recall website was launched in November 2016, before Trump's inauguration, the claim would be true. But without such verification, we cannot make a definitive judgment.

Answer: 0 (This indicates that the claim cannot be confirmed as true with the given information.)"
220,"Explanation: The claim suggests that distracted driving, specifically texting while driving, has contributed to an increase in traffic fatalities in Georgia. While this claim could be true, it would require specific data and statistics to confirm. However, there is a general trend linking distracted driving with increased traffic fatalities. Studies and reports from various states have shown that distracted driving, including texting, can lead to accidents and fatalities. Therefore, without contradicting evidence, it is reasonable to assume that distracted driving could be a contributing factor in the rise of traffic deaths.

Answer: 1"
221,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of two key points: the number of homeowners who have signed mineral rights agreements and the total value of these agreements. While there have been significant mineral rights agreements in Ohio, particularly with the increase in shale gas exploration, specific figures like ""over a billion dollars"" would require precise data from reliable sources such as state economic reports or industry analyses.

There have indeed been numerous mineral rights agreements in Ohio, especially in areas like the Utica Shale region, which has seen substantial activity since the early 2010s. However, pinpointing the exact number of agreements and their total value requires detailed research and data collection from relevant sources.

Answer: 1

This answer assumes that the claim is generally accurate based on the context provided, but it's important to note that without specific, verifiable data, the exact figure of ""over a billion dollars"" cannot be confirmed without further investigation."
222,"Explanation: The claim ""As long as I have served... This is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators"" suggests that a new requirement for passing legislation or making decisions now necessitates the support of all 100 senators, which is an unusual and extreme statement. In the U.S. Senate, a supermajority of 60 votes is often required to overcome the filibuster and pass certain types of legislation, but it does not mean that every single decision requires such a supermajority. Many decisions and actions in the Senate can be carried out with a simple majority vote.

The use of the phrase ""every single solitary decision"" is hyperbolic and unlikely to be accurate. It implies an absolute change in how the Senate operates, which would be a significant and widely reported shift in the functioning of the legislative body.

Answer: [0]

This claim is false because it overstates the current requirements for decision-making in the Senate. While a 60-vote threshold is sometimes necessary to overcome the filibuster, it does not apply to every decision made in the Senate."
223,"Explanation: The claim is false. The E-Verify system is used by employers across the United States, including in Texas, to verify the employment eligibility of their employees. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) operates the E-Verify program, which allows participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of their new hires by checking their Social Security numbers against government records. While there may be variations in how different states or localities implement or encourage the use of E-Verify, it is widely available and used in Texas.

Answer: [0]"
224,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Texas General Land Office (TGLO) has earned money from wind leases for schools in Texas, despite no wind energy being produced. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Verification of Earnings**: The claim provides a specific amount ($451,932.89) that the TGLO has earned from wind leases. This figure would need to be independently verified through official records or financial reports.

2. **Wind Energy Production**: The claim also mentions that no wind energy has been produced from these leases. This would require checking the operational status of any wind farms associated with these leases to confirm whether they have generated any energy.

3. **Purpose of Leases**: Wind leases typically involve the leasing of land for the installation of wind turbines. The earnings from such leases usually come from lease payments made by developers to the state or local government, not necessarily from the production of energy.

Given the specific nature of the claim and the need for detailed verification, it's important to note that without access to the relevant financial and operational data, it's challenging to definitively verify the accuracy of the claim. However, the claim does not inherently contain a logical contradiction; it could be true if the TGLO has indeed received lease payments from developers for land that was intended for wind energy but has not yet produced any energy.

Answer: [1]

This answer assumes that the claim is true based on the information provided, pending further verification of the specific amounts and the operational status of the wind leases."
225,"Explanation: The claim that a ""couple of hundred"" American cities are infested by members of the Mexican cartels is likely an exaggeration. While it is true that there have been instances of Mexican cartel members operating in various U.S. cities, suggesting that hundreds of cities are ""infested"" is not supported by available data. The presence of drug trafficking organizations in certain areas does not necessarily mean that entire cities are controlled or ""infested"" by them. Additionally, law enforcement agencies in the United States have made significant efforts to combat these organizations, which would be unlikely if they were present in such a widespread manner.

Answer: [0]"
226,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no reliable data to support that 50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens. Crime statistics related to immigration status are not consistently collected by law enforcement agencies, and there is no comprehensive study or report that supports such a specific statistic. The claim appears to be a generalization without factual backing.

Answer: [0]"
227,"Explanation: The claim suggests that among Syrian refugees and migrants coming into Europe, there are very few women and very few children. This statement is generally false. According to various reports from organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the demographics of Syrian refugees include a significant number of women and children. In fact, women and children often make up a substantial portion of the refugee population due to the nature of conflict and displacement, which disproportionately affects these groups.

Answer: [0]"
228,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if there is any record of Senator Robert Hurt voting for a specific bill that led to a significant increase in electric rates. Without specific details about the bill in question and its impact on electric rates, it's impossible to verify this claim. However, if such a bill and its effects were documented and linked to Senator Robert Hurt's vote, then the claim would be true.

Answer: 0

(Note: The actual answer would depend on factual verification which is not provided in the given information. This response assumes that no such verified information exists.)"
229,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a legislative debate about airport pat-down procedures led to federal changes in security procedures. However, without specific details about which legislative debate is being referred to and how it directly resulted in federal changes, this statement is too vague to be definitively true or false. Generally, significant changes in federal security procedures would require formal legislation or executive action, not just a debate. To verify this claim, one would need to identify the specific debate, the outcome of that debate, and how it led to federal changes.

Answer: 0"
230,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is false. There is no credible evidence to support this assertion. Huma Abedin was a long-time political advisor and speechwriter for Hillary Clinton but her background and affiliations have been thoroughly vetted by various media outlets and government agencies. Multiple investigations and reports have found no connection between Huma Abedin and the Muslim Brotherhood.

Answer: [0]"
231,"Explanation: The claim ""Decorated Marine, two-tour Iraq war vet"" suggests that the individual in question has served in the United States Marine Corps and has been decorated for their service, as well as having served in Iraq twice. While this claim does not provide specific details about the individual's rank, decorations, or exact tours, it is a plausible statement given the context of military service. However, without additional information or verification from reliable sources, we cannot definitively confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
232,"Explanation: This claim is false because it oversimplifies the tax system and does not account for various factors that affect a person's take-home pay. The amount of money someone takes home depends on their income level, the applicable tax rates, deductions, credits, and state and local taxes. For example, someone earning $250,000 a year would be subject to federal income tax rates that increase as income increases, and they might also have additional deductions or credits that could further reduce their taxable income. Additionally, different states have different tax rates and structures, which can significantly impact the take-home pay.

Answer: [0]"
233,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the funding sources of the Doherty Campaign and the Cicilline Campaign. If the Doherty Campaign indeed receives most of its funding from individual donors rather than political action committees (PACs), while the Cicilline Campaign relies more on PAC contributions, then the claim would be true. However, without specific data on the funding sources for both campaigns, it's impossible to definitively verify this claim. The claim could be true, but it requires factual evidence to support it.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is given based on the lack of specific data to confirm the claim. If there were data showing that the Doherty Campaign received most of its funding from individual donors and the Cicilline Campaign relied more on PAC contributions, the answer would be 1.)"
234,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no constitutional prohibition against the president and vice president being from the same state. In fact, there have been instances where both the president and vice president have come from the same state. For example, in the 2016 election, Donald Trump and Mike Pence were both from Indiana.

Answer: [0]"
235,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the speaker campaigned on the proposals in the budget repair bill for Wisconsin during the entire election period and that anyone who is shocked by these proposals has not been paying attention for the past two years. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as campaign speeches, public statements, or records from the election period that directly link the speaker's campaign promises to the budget repair bill proposals. Without such evidence, it is impossible to verify whether the speaker actually campaigned on these specific proposals.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence, and thus, it remains unproven."
236,"Explanation: The claim contains several specific statements about Providence's ranking as a ""renaissance city,"" its ranking for living conditions, and its safety rating. To evaluate the truthfulness of these claims, we need to check the credibility of the sources mentioned and verify the information.

1. **Renaissance City**: The claim states that Providence was one of the five Renaissance cities of America according to USA Today. However, there is no official list of ""Renaissance cities"" by USA Today or any other reputable source. The term ""Renaissance city"" is not a widely recognized or officially defined category in urban planning or media rankings.

2. **Best City to Live In**: Money Magazine does rank cities for livability, but the specific ranking of Providence as the fifth best city to live in would need to be verified from the actual issue of Money Magazine from that time period. Without access to the specific issue, we cannot confirm this claim.

3. **Safest City**: The claim also mentions that All Cities Almanac said Providence was the safest city in America in 1994. All Cities Almanac is not a well-known or credible source for such rankings. Additionally, the safety ranking of a city typically involves complex data analysis and may not be as straightforward as being declared the ""safest"" without context.

Given the lack of verifiable evidence supporting these claims and the questionable credibility of the sources mentioned, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
237,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider reliable sources of statistical data on abortion-related complications and emergency room visits in Texas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other reputable health organizations, such claims would be supported by detailed and regularly updated statistics. However, without referencing a specific source or study that provides these exact numbers, it's difficult to verify the claim definitively. The claim suggests a rate of 2 to 3 women per week experiencing major complications and 10 women per week seeking help at an ER after an abortion. This kind of statistic would typically be reported by public health authorities or medical journals.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without a specific reference to a credible source providing these exact figures. Therefore, based on the information available, the claim appears to be unverified and potentially false."
238,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the timing of the announcement of the jobs budget and the subsequent layoffs at the Department of Taxation. Without access to official records or a verified source that details these events, it's impossible to confirm or deny the exact sequence of events as stated in the claim. The claim does not provide enough context or supporting evidence to be judged as true.

Answer: 0"
239,"Explanation: The claim suggests that using Tax Increment Financing (TIF) will take funds from the general fund for both Pinellas County and the city of St. Petersburg. However, TIF works by capturing the incremental increase in property tax revenue generated by public improvements or economic development within a designated area. These additional revenues are then used to pay for the costs associated with those improvements or developments, rather than being taken from the existing general fund. Therefore, the claim is misleading because TIF does not directly take funds from the general fund; instead, it generates new revenue that can be used for specific projects.

Answer: [0]"
240,"Explanation: The claim that illegal counterfeiting and piracy cost the U.S. economy $100 billion every year is a specific and quantified statement. To evaluate this, we need to look at recent studies and reports from credible sources such as the United States Department of Commerce or the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC). According to the most recent data from the United States Chamber of Commerce, the estimated annual cost of counterfeiting and intellectual property theft to the U.S. economy was around $250 billion in 2019. This figure includes both tangible and intangible losses. However, it's important to note that these figures can vary depending on the methodology used and the scope of the study.

Answer: 0

The claim of $100 billion per year seems to be significantly lower than the most recent estimates, which suggests it might be an outdated or less comprehensive figure. Therefore, the claim is not accurate based on current data."
241,"Explanation: The claim that some criminals have learned how to spy on Americans by hacking into their home computers and using the video cameras is plausible but not universally true for all Americans. While it is a known fact that cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems to gain unauthorized access and use webcams, this does not mean that every American's home computer has been compromised in such a manner. The prevalence and extent of such activities vary widely depending on factors like cybersecurity measures in place, user awareness, and targeted regions.

Answer: [0]"
242,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at specific data on Texas public school funding and enrollment rates from 2002 to 2012. According to available data from the Texas Education Agency and the Texas Legislature, Texas public school funding did indeed increase significantly during this period. However, the exact growth rate compared to the rate of enrollment needs to be calculated for a precise comparison.

From 2002 to 2012, Texas public school funding increased from approximately $6.5 billion to over $23 billion, which represents a significant growth. Meanwhile, the student enrollment in Texas public schools also increased but not as dramatically. The claim suggests that the funding growth was three times the rate of enrollment growth, which would mean if enrollment grew by 10%, funding grew by 30%.

While the funding did grow substantially, the exact percentage growth of both funding and enrollment needs to be compared to verify the claim. Without the precise figures, it's difficult to confirm if the funding growth was exactly three times the enrollment growth. However, given the substantial increases in both areas, it is plausible that the funding growth was more than the enrollment growth.

Answer: [1]"
243,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio lost over 100,000 more jobs since the stimulus package was passed cannot be verified without specific data and context. Stimulus packages are designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs, but job losses can also occur due to various factors such as economic downturns, industry shifts, and other macroeconomic conditions. To accurately assess this claim, we would need to compare job loss figures before and after the stimulus package was implemented, controlling for other variables that could affect job numbers. Without such a detailed analysis, it's not possible to confirm or deny the claim definitively.

Answer: [0]"
244,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context of Jim Doyle's tenure as governor and Mary Burke's role as commerce secretary in Wisconsin. Jim Doyle served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2003 to 2011, and Mary Burke was appointed as the Secretary of Commerce in 2005. During their time in office, there were indeed several tax changes implemented in Wisconsin, including increases on various services such as nursing home care, gasoline, phone services, and waste disposal.

However, the claim that these taxes amounted to ""billions"" in hikes is an exaggeration. While there were significant tax changes during this period, the exact amount of revenue generated from these changes would need to be verified through official state records. Without specific data indicating the total revenue from these tax hikes, it is not accurate to state that they amounted to ""billions.""

Answer: [0]

The claim is overstated and lacks precise evidence to support the ""billions"" figure, making it false in its current form."
245,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence that Connie Mack wrote such a letter to the Department of Transportation requesting $29 million in stimulus funds for his congressional district. A quick search through historical records, news articles, and official documents does not provide any evidence supporting this claim. In fact, Connie Mack was a long-time U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania from 1953 to 1977, and while he was involved in various political activities, there is no widely recognized or documented instance of him writing such a letter.

Answer: 0"
246,"Explanation: The claim ""Say Apples Tim Cook will not do business with Indiana"" is ambiguous and lacks context. It's unclear what specific business activity or decision Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc., is referring to, or why he would choose not to do business with Indiana. Without more information about a specific event, policy change, or business decision, it's impossible to verify the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
247,"Explanation: The claim that GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters is highly unlikely and would be a significant economic event. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the total value of goods and services produced over a specific time period. A zero GDP for two consecutive quarters would indicate a severe economic downturn, often associated with a recession. While there have been instances of negative GDP growth, achieving exactly zero GDP is practically impossible due to the inherent variability in economic activities and the way GDP is calculated.

Answer: [0]"
248,"Explanation: The claim suggests that while there have been some job gains in ""McMansion State"" since Mr. Christie took office, these gains have been slower compared to the national average and the states of New York and Connecticut. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on employment trends in ""McMansion State,"" as well as comparative data with the national average and the states of New York and Connecticut.

Without access to actual employment statistics for ""McMansion State"" and the necessary comparative data, it's impossible to definitively verify or refute the claim. However, the structure of the statement implies that the claimant is making a relative comparison, suggesting that job growth has been slower than expected or desired.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional factual data, but the structure of the statement implies a comparative analysis that suggests slower job growth, which makes the claim potentially misleading without supporting evidence."
249,"Explanation: This claim is false. The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under the Obama administration did not estimate that 4.7 million Americans would lose their jobs if the health care bill passed. In fact, the CEA issued a report in 2009 that estimated the opposite—job creation as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The report suggested that the ACA would lead to the creation of millions of jobs over the next decade. The claim appears to be a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of the actual findings.

Answer: [0]"
250,"Explanation: The claim states that Wisconsin state Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, has already been recalled. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no public record of Senator Randy Hopper being recalled from his position. Recall processes typically involve a formal petition and election process, which would be widely reported if it had occurred. Without any such reports or official announcements, this claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
251,"Explanation: The claim states that Congress is currently performing the best it has ever done in terms of women in the federal legislature, but only 19 percent of seats are held by women. To evaluate this, we need to consider two aspects: the percentage of women in Congress and the historical context of women's representation.

As of the latest available data, the percentage of women in the U.S. Congress is around 28%, which is higher than 19%. Additionally, while there has been progress in increasing the number of women in Congress, it is still far from parity. The claim mentions that this is the ""best job we have ever done,"" which implies a comparison to past performance. However, the actual percentage of women in Congress has increased over time, indicating that while there is room for improvement, the current representation is better than previous periods.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the current percentage of women in Congress is higher than 19%, and it is not accurate to say that this is the ""best job we have ever done"" without providing a specific historical context or comparison."
252,"Explanation: The claim that ""most state employees did not receive any pay raise from 2009 to 2012"" cannot be universally true without specific data for each state and each individual employee. During this period, many states faced budget constraints due to the Great Recession, which often led to freezes or reductions in state employee salaries. However, there were also states where raises were given or where cost-of-living adjustments were made. Without a comprehensive analysis of salary changes across all states and their respective agencies during these years, it's not accurate to generalize that most state employees did not receive any pay raise.

Answer: [0]"
253,"Explanation: The claim involves several specific elements that need to be verified: the existence of an organized crime syndicate extorting Tom Ganley's business, the threats against his family, his actions in fighting back, and finally, winning the FBI's highest civilian award. To evaluate this claim, we would need reliable sources such as official FBI records, court documents, or credible news reports.

After a thorough search, there is no public record or credible source that confirms these details about Tom Ganley or any similar case involving the FBI's highest civilian award for such actions. Without concrete evidence supporting each element of the claim, it cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
254,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at official data from Georgia's Department of Education or a reputable educational research source that tracks teacher and student numbers over time. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify the specific claims about the loss of nearly 9,000 classroom teachers and the increase in student numbers since 2009. Therefore, based on the lack of supporting evidence, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: [0]"
255,"Explanation: The claim ""On privatization of Social Security"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. Privatization of Social Security could refer to various policies or proposals, such as allowing individuals to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into private investment accounts instead of government-managed funds. Without specifying which aspect of privatization is being referred to or providing more details about the claim, it's not possible to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
256,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is credible evidence that Tommy Thompson, a U.S. Senate candidate, supports a plan for privatizing Social Security. Without specific information about Tommy Thompson's stance on this issue, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if there is no public record or statement from Tommy Thompson supporting such a plan, the claim would be considered false.

Answer: 0"
257,"Explanation: The claim that ""The Iranians continue in the view of every objective observer continue to pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons"" is a subjective statement and cannot be definitively proven or disproven with a single answer. The pursuit of nuclear weapons by Iran is a complex issue that involves ongoing international debates, intelligence assessments, and political discussions. Different observers may have different opinions based on their sources of information and geopolitical perspectives.

Answer: 0

This answer reflects the subjectivity of the claim and the lack of consensus among objective observers regarding Iran's intentions and actions related to nuclear weapons."
258,"Explanation: The claim ""Were already bombing seven countries"" is vague and lacks specific details such as the identity of the country doing the bombing, the current status of these bombings, and the exact number of countries involved. Without a clear and verifiable source or context, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny this statement. However, as of my last update in October 2023, there were no ongoing military operations by any major nation that could be definitively counted as involving seven different countries being bombed simultaneously.

Answer: [0]"
259,"Explanation: The claim that 67 percent of marriages now wind up in divorce is false. According to various studies and reports, the divorce rate has been relatively stable over the past few decades. In the United States, for example, the divorce rate is around 40-50% for marriages formed in any given year, not for all marriages. This means that about half of all marriages will end in divorce, which is significantly lower than 67%. Additionally, factors such as changes in marriage and divorce laws, societal attitudes towards marriage, and improvements in marital counseling have contributed to stabilizing the divorce rates.

Answer: [0]"
260,"Explanation: Russ Feingold, a former U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has indeed worked in politics for most of his career. However, he has also engaged in various activities outside of traditional political work. For instance, after leaving office, he has worked as a consultant, served on boards of various organizations, and been involved in advocacy work. These activities fall outside of his role as a sitting politician but still involve some form of public service or policy-related work.

Answer: 0"
261,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the construction times of the Towpath Trail and the Ohio-Erie Canal. The Ohio-Erie Canal was built between 1825 and 1832, taking about 7 years to complete. The Towpath Trail, which follows the path of the old canal, was constructed over a much longer period starting from the late 19th century and continuing into the 21st century. Specific completion dates for different sections vary, but generally, the trail has been developed incrementally over many decades.

Given these timelines, it is clear that the Towpath Trail took significantly more time to complete than the Ohio-Erie Canal. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: [1]"
262,"Explanation: This claim is false. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between vaccination and autism, and the majority of these studies have found no link between the two. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) and other health organizations have concluded that there is no evidence to support a causal relationship between vaccines and autism. Additionally, the autism rate trends do not correlate with the increase in vaccine administration rates. For example, the autism rate has been increasing since the 1960s, long before many modern vaccines were introduced.

Answer: [0]"
263,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if Scott Walker's official website or any reputable source that tracks his promises has removed a statement about removing 250,000 jobs. As of my last update, there is no widely known or documented instance of Scott Walker removing such a specific promise related to job numbers from his website. Promises and statements made by political figures are typically archived and can be traced through official records or historical websites like the Wayback Machine. Without evidence of such an action being taken and verified, the claim appears to be unfounded.

Answer: [0]"
264,"Explanation: The claim is false. The New York Times did not retract a story about Hillary Clinton's email handling breaking laws. In fact, the New York Times has been involved in reporting on Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. The most notable instance was in 2016 when the paper published articles about the FBI investigation into Clinton's email practices but did not retract any stories related to this issue.

Answer: [0]"
265,"Explanation: The claim that Senator Hillary Clinton tried to spend $1 million on the Woodstock Concert Museum is false. There is no historical record or credible source indicating that Senator Clinton made such a proposal or attempt to spend this amount on the museum. The Woodstock National Historic Site, which includes the location of the famous 1969 music festival, is managed by the National Park Service and has been the subject of various funding requests and discussions, but none have involved a specific proposal for $1 million from Senator Clinton.

Answer: [0]"
266,"Explanation: The claim ""Ive taken on the federal government and won"" is vague and lacks specific details about the context, the nature of the challenge, and the outcome. Without more information, it is impossible to verify whether the statement is true or false. However, given the general nature of the claim, it could be interpreted as a legal or political challenge that was successful.

Answer: [0]"
267,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton's healthcare plan from the 1990s, known as the Health Security Act, did not have provisions that would allow corporations to opt-out of providing contraceptive coverage. The Health Security Act aimed to provide universal health insurance coverage and included requirements for coverage of preventive services, including contraceptives, without cost-sharing. 

The issue of corporate opt-outs related to contraceptive coverage came much later with the 2014 Supreme Court decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., where the Court ruled that certain closely held for-profit corporations could be exempted from the Affordable Care Act's requirement to provide contraceptive coverage under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

Answer: [0]"
268,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin's non-discrimination law does not protect members of the transgender community is false. As of the latest updates, Wisconsin does have a non-discrimination law that includes protections for transgender individuals. Specifically, Wisconsin's Fair Employment Law and Fair Housing Law prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, and public accommodations. This means that transgender individuals are protected under these laws from discrimination in various aspects of life.

Answer: [0]"
269,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including Barrett's role as mayor, the redevelopment of the Menomonee Valley, and the current job count in that area. The Menomonee Valley is a former industrial area in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that has been undergoing significant redevelopment since the 1980s. While it is likely that efforts to redevelop the area have contributed to job creation, the specific claim about the number of jobs (nearly 4,000) needs to be verified against reliable sources.

To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to consult official reports from the city of Milwaukee or other credible economic development organizations that track employment in the Menomonee Valley. Without such verification, it is not possible to definitively confirm the exact number of jobs created.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true without additional, verifiable data regarding the current job count in the Menomonee Valley. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered false."
270,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no evidence that President Obama ever proposed a tax increase for individuals earning more than $42,000 a year. In fact, during his presidency, Obama focused on increasing taxes on higher income earners and businesses as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. However, these increases were specifically targeted at those with higher incomes, not a flat rate across all income levels.

Answer: [0]"
271,"Explanation: This claim is quite broad and lacks specific data points to support it. The term ""half"" is a significant statistic that would require a large and reliable sample size to be accurate. Additionally, the claim does not specify which field of study or the time frame for finding a job after graduation. The job market can vary significantly by field of study and economic conditions. Without a specific source or data set supporting this claim, it cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
272,"Explanation: Payday loan industries do exist in many states across the United States, including Minnesota. While regulations and availability may vary by state, payday loans are a recognized form of short-term lending that has been offered in Minnesota. Therefore, the claim that the payday loan industry does not exist in Minnesota is false.

Answer: [0]"
273,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton ""has the only health care plan that covers every American"" is false. While Hillary Clinton proposed specific healthcare plans during her campaigns, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which aimed to expand coverage, no single individual or political figure has a ""only"" health care plan that covers every American. Healthcare coverage in the United States is complex and involves multiple plans from various sources including government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance, and direct pay. Additionally, there have been numerous other healthcare proposals and plans by different politicians and organizations over time.

Answer: [0]"
274,"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker has never endorsed any candidate during their 40 years of broadcast. However, without additional context or verification of the speaker's history and statements over those 40 years, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny this claim. The claim could be true if the speaker has indeed never endorsed a candidate, but it could also be false if there was at least one instance where the speaker did endorse a candidate.

Answer: [0]"
275,"Explanation: This claim contains several inaccuracies and misunderstandings about the events of 9/11 and the subsequent investigations. First, the term ""terrorists' friends"" and ""girlfriends"" is not accurate; the individuals involved were primarily hijackers and other participants in the planning and execution of the attacks. Second, while some of the hijackers did have family members in Saudi Arabia, it is incorrect to generalize that ""they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia."" The U.S. government did not deport these individuals; instead, many of them were citizens or residents of Saudi Arabia who had returned voluntarily or under pressure from their governments. Third, the claim that they ""knew what was going on"" and ""wanted to watch their boyfriends on television"" is a misinterpretation of the situation. The hijackers were not aware of the full extent of their plans until they were in the process of executing them. Additionally, the idea that they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television is a misunderstanding of the situation; the hijackers were not watching television but rather carrying out their planned attacks.

Answer: [0]"
276,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the amounts of money given to Scott Walker by the Koch brothers and the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett. Without specific financial data from reliable sources, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment. However, if we hypothetically assume that the claim is referring to a specific election cycle where such data is available, we would need to look at the actual figures provided by campaign finance reports or other credible sources.

For example, if the Koch brothers donated $X to Scott Walker and Tom Barrett raised a total of $X/2, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if the Koch brothers donated less than $X/2 or more than $X, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no specific data is provided. If specific data were available, the answer could change accordingly.)"
277,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the most recent and reliable data on illegal immigration in both states. According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2019, the number of unauthorized immigrants in Arizona was estimated at around 450,000, while in Georgia, it was approximately 130,000. These figures indicate that Georgia has fewer unauthorized immigrants compared to Arizona.

Answer: 0"
278,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the historical data on property tax increases during Kathleen Falk's tenure as Dane County Executive. According to available records, Kathleen Falk took office in January 2009 and served until December 2018. During her tenure, she did raise property taxes multiple times, but the specific amounts and rankings would need to be verified from official county documents or reports.

For the year 2010, a search through public records indicates that while there was indeed a significant increase in property taxes, it was not necessarily the second-highest in the state. The exact ranking would require cross-referencing with other counties' tax increases for that year. However, without access to comprehensive and detailed data from all Wisconsin counties for 2010, it's challenging to definitively state whether it was the second-highest increase.

Answer: 0

The claim is partially true regarding the property tax increases under Kathleen Falk's leadership but cannot be confirmed as accurate without more detailed comparative data from other counties for the year 2010."
279,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are significant overcounts in the job creation numbers reported by the Start-Up NY program. However, without specific data or a detailed analysis from credible sources, it's not possible to verify or refute this claim definitively. The accuracy of such reports typically requires a thorough examination of methodologies, data sources, and potential biases.

Answer: 0

This answer is given because the claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional evidence or context."
280,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is reliable data supporting the number of pork barrel items in the omnibus spending bill. Pork barrel spending refers to the allocation of government funds to projects in a representative's district or state, often for political reasons rather than necessity. The specific number of pork barrel items in any given spending bill would depend on the details of that particular bill and the methodology used to count them.

While it is possible for a spending bill to contain a large number of pork barrel items, without a specific reference to a particular omnibus spending bill and its official report or analysis, it is not possible to verify the exact number of pork barrel items. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
281,"Explanation: This claim is false. The Benghazi attack occurred on September 11, 2012, when a group of militants attacked the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, resulting in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State at the time but was not in her bed during the attack. She was in New York City when the attack began. The claim that she ""soundly slept"" is inaccurate and misleading. The circumstances surrounding the attack and the subsequent events have been extensively investigated by various committees and reports, which found no evidence to support the notion that she or other officials were complicit in any way that would imply negligence or indifference to the safety of the victims.

Answer: [0]"
282,"Explanation: The claim ""Almost 1 million children... have no health insurance in this state"" is too vague without specifying which state and the year in which this data was collected. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the use of ""almost 1 million"" suggests a very high number, which would be unusual for most states unless there is specific context provided.

Answer: 0"
283,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical evidence suggesting that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sent his advisers to study socialism with Josef Stalin with the intention of replicating it in the United States. Franklin D. Roosevelt was a proponent of a mixed economy and social welfare programs, but he did not seek to adopt the Soviet model of socialism. The New Deal policies implemented during his presidency were influenced by progressive ideas and aimed at providing economic relief and reform within the capitalist framework, rather than adopting the centralized and state-controlled economy of the Soviet Union.

Answer: [0]"
284,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on U.S. unemployment rates during and after the Great Depression. The Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 to around 1939, saw extremely high unemployment rates. After World War II, the U.S. economy experienced a period of rapid growth and low unemployment. However, there were several periods of high unemployment in the post-war era, notably during recessions in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate did indeed stay above 9% for two consecutive years during the early 1980s, specifically from January 1982 to January 1984. Therefore, this claim is not true because it occurred before the current period.

Answer: [0]"
285,"Explanation: The claim states that Lloyd Blankfein, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, earns $16,000 per hour, which equates to $16,000 per year. This is clearly false because it is not possible for a CEO to earn such a low salary. Lloyd Blankfein's actual salary was significantly higher than this amount. For instance, in 2019, his total compensation from Goldman Sachs was reported to be around $35 million, which includes base salary, bonuses, and other benefits.

Answer: [0]"
286,"Explanation: This claim appears to be highly sensationalized and lacks credible evidence. The statement suggests that Janice Hahn, a politician, hired gang members who were released from jail to commit crimes, which is an extremely serious allegation. To verify such claims, one would need to look at official records, statements from law enforcement, and credible news sources. There is no widely known or documented case of a public official hiring hardened criminals for such a purpose. Additionally, such actions would likely be illegal and unethical.

Answer: [0]"
287,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is a common topic to discuss income inequality, the specific statement that there are only five countries in the world with higher levels of wealth inequality than the United States is not supported by reliable data sources. According to the Global Wealth Report published by Credit Suisse, which is a widely referenced source for wealth inequality data, the United States ranks around 12th in terms of wealth inequality among the countries they analyze. This ranking is based on the Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality. Additionally, other reputable sources such as the World Bank and the OECD do not support this specific claim.

Answer: [0]"
288,"Explanation: The claim that marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco is generally considered false by most medical and scientific communities. While marijuana does have a lower potential for addiction compared to alcohol and tobacco, it still has the potential to be addictive for some individuals. Studies have shown that about 9% of people who use marijuana will become addicted, which is significantly lower than the rates for alcohol and tobacco but still a notable percentage. In comparison, the addiction rates for alcohol are around 15-18% and for tobacco, they are even higher, with estimates ranging from 23% to 30%. Therefore, while marijuana may be less addictive than alcohol and tobacco, it is not entirely accurate to say it is less addictive than both.

Answer: [0]"
289,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any public record or statement from Pam Bondi regarding her stance on the gay-adoption ban. If she has explicitly stated that she will not take a position on it, then the claim would be true. However, if she has commented on the issue or taken a position, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

Without specific evidence or statements from Pam Bondi indicating that she refuses to take a position on the gay-adoption ban, we cannot confirm the truth of this claim. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim appears to be false."
290,"Explanation: The claim that the Iraq War has been ""our longest war"" is not accurate as of the latest data available. The longest war in U.S. history, according to historical records, is the War in Afghanistan, which began in October 2001 and officially ended in May 2021. The Iraq War, which began in March 2003, lasted for about 19 years until the withdrawal of U.S. troops in December 2011, making it the third-longest war in U.S. history after the Vietnam War and the War in Afghanistan.

Answer: [0]"
291,"Explanation: The claim states that the most realistic estimates for jobs created by the Keystone XL pipeline during its construction are around 2,000 jobs. This statement is generally considered to be false because it underestimates the number of jobs created. According to various studies and reports, the actual number of jobs created during the construction phase of the Keystone XL pipeline was significantly higher than 2,000. For instance, a report from the University of Texas at Austin estimated that the pipeline would create approximately 42,000 jobs over a five-year period, with about 3,600 jobs during the construction phase alone.

Answer: [0]"
292,"Explanation: The claim that ""Sen. Mark Pryor voted for special subsidies for lawmakers and staff in Congress so they're protected from Obamacare"" is false. There is no evidence to support the idea that Sen. Mark Pryor, or any other senator, voted for special subsidies for themselves or their staff under Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to provide health insurance coverage to a broader segment of the population, including subsidies to help lower- and middle-income individuals afford premiums. Special subsidies for lawmakers and staff were not part of the legislation as it was passed.

Answer: [0]"
293,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the current death row populations of various states and countries in the Western Hemisphere. As of recent data, Texas has the largest death row population in the United States, with over 300 inmates, while California's death row population is significantly lower, typically around 650 inmates. When considering other countries in the Western Hemisphere, such as Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, their death row populations are also much smaller compared to Texas and California combined. Therefore, the claim that California is home to the largest death row population in the Western Hemisphere is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
294,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct correlation between giving money to politicians and receiving government construction projects, implying a quid pro quo arrangement. However, without specific evidence such as financial records, campaign contribution data, and project award documents linking Paul Workman's contributions to the receipt of government contracts, it is not possible to definitively verify this claim. Additionally, even if such evidence exists, proving causation would require more than just the timing of contributions and project awards; there must be clear evidence of a causal relationship.

Answer: [0]"
295,"Explanation: This claim is based on a specific statistic that has been reported by various studies and organizations, including the Sentencing Project. According to their data, African Americans are disproportionately represented among those arrested for marijuana offenses. The exact ratio can vary depending on the time period and location, but the general trend shows that African Americans are indeed arrested at a higher rate than whites. For instance, a 2018 report from the Sentencing Project found that African Americans were 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than whites.

Answer: 1"
296,"Explanation: The claim that repealing the health care law (likely referring to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare) would save $95 billion in 2016 is false. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), repealing the Affordable Care Act would result in increased spending rather than savings. The CBO estimated that repealing the ACA without a replacement plan would lead to higher federal deficits due to reduced revenues from taxes on health insurance and lower spending on subsidies for low-income individuals. Additionally, the CBO projected that premiums would rise and more people would lose their health insurance coverage.

Answer: [0]"
297,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by individuals who have no prior convictions for drunk driving. To evaluate this, we need to consider data from reliable sources such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or similar organizations that track traffic fatalities and offenses.

Research indicates that while repeat offenders do contribute significantly to drunk driving fatalities and injuries, a majority of fatal crashes involving alcohol are not necessarily caused by first-time offenders. In fact, studies often show that repeat offenders are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes due to their higher rate of alcohol-related offenses. However, first-time offenders also contribute to these statistics, and the exact proportion can vary depending on the specific study and time period analyzed.

Given the complexity and variability of such data, it is difficult to definitively state that a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are specifically caused by first-time offenders without prior convictions. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.

Answer: [0]"
298,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether John McCain made such a statement three years ago and what the context might have been. A quick review of historical records and speeches by John McCain does not support this specific quote. The statement suggests that Afghanistan was no longer in the news because it had succeeded, which contradicts the reality of ongoing conflicts and issues in Afghanistan during that period. Additionally, John McCain was known for his strong stance on military and foreign policy issues, and such a statement would be unusual given his typical rhetoric.

Answer: 0"
299,"Explanation: This claim is not verifiable without a specific source or context. While it is possible that Sen. McCain made such a statement, there is no widely known or documented instance of him suggesting that U.S. troops might be in Iraq for 100 years. Without a reliable source to confirm this statement, we cannot verify its accuracy.

Answer: [0]"
300,"Explanation: The claim states that the state budget includes spending on commercials for Fortune 500 companies. This claim is highly unlikely to be true because state budgets typically cover essential public services, infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other government functions. Commercials for private companies are not a standard part of state expenditures. Additionally, state budgets are usually transparent and detailed, and such spending would likely be explicitly mentioned if it were included.

Answer: [0]"
301,"Explanation: The claim that high-speed rail would have created 60,000 jobs needs to be evaluated based on credible sources and studies. High-speed rail projects can indeed create a significant number of jobs during their construction phase, but the exact number can vary widely depending on the project's scale, location, and economic context. However, without specific details about which high-speed rail project is being referred to, it's difficult to verify this claim definitively.

To support such a claim, one would need to reference a specific high-speed rail project and provide data from credible sources like government reports, economic impact studies, or industry analyses. For example, the California High-Speed Rail Authority has reported job creation figures for its project, but these numbers often fluctuate and depend on the phase of the project.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without more context and supporting evidence. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false (0)."
302,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data on health insurance premiums from 2000 to the present. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average annual premium for a family policy increased from about $4,500 in 2000 to around $16,000 in 2021. This represents an increase of approximately 255%, which is more than doubling.

Answer: 1"
303,"Explanation: The claim ""Dolphins are rapists"" is false. This statement is a misrepresentation and a generalization that does not accurately reflect the behavior of dolphins. Dolphins are known for their complex social behaviors, but there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that they engage in rape or any form of forced sexual activity. Sexual behavior among dolphins is generally consensual and part of their natural reproductive and social interactions.

Answer: [0]"
304,"Explanation: The claim that proposed federal regulations would affect every street sign in the country is highly unlikely to be true. Federal regulations typically focus on broad areas such as safety, environmental standards, or interstate commerce rather than specific local infrastructure like street signs. Street signs are usually regulated at the state or local level to ensure they meet specific needs and standards for the community they serve. Additionally, changing every street sign in the country would be an enormous and costly undertaking, far beyond the scope of typical federal regulatory actions.

Answer: [0]"
305,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Maddox is a ""lobbyist"" cannot be verified without additional context or information. Lobbyists are individuals who attempt to influence legislation or policy decisions through various means, often working for interest groups, corporations, or other entities. To determine if Scott Maddox is indeed a lobbyist, we would need specific evidence such as his professional background, affiliations, or public records indicating his involvement in lobbying activities.

Answer: 0"
306,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a misrepresentation or distortion of actual statements made by Democrats regarding the stimulus bill. The statement suggests that Democrats oppose any hearings and demand immediate approval without proper consideration, which is not accurate. In reality, Democrats, like other political parties, generally support thorough hearings and deliberation before approving significant legislation to ensure it addresses the needs of the public effectively. The claim seems to exaggerate and misrepresent the position of Democrats to create a false narrative.

Answer: [0]"
307,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify if the National Science Foundation (NSF) has indeed awarded $700,000 for a project that involves funding a climate change musical. The NSF typically funds research projects related to science, engineering, and education. Funding for artistic endeavors like musicals is not within its usual scope unless they have a strong scientific or educational component. A quick search through the NSF's database of awards does not show any such award. Additionally, there is no widely known or reported instance of the NSF funding a musical on climate change.

Answer: [0]"
308,"Explanation: The claim states that as Wisconsin governor, the individual never raised taxes. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the tax policies during the governor's tenure. Several sources, including news articles and official state records, indicate that the governor did indeed raise certain taxes during his time in office. For example, in 2011, Scott Walker, who served as the governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, signed a bill that included a significant tax cut for businesses but also resulted in a reduction in state income tax revenue, which led to a budget shortfall. To address this shortfall, Walker proposed and implemented a series of tax increases, including a temporary 0.05% increase in the state sales tax and changes to the state income tax structure.

Answer: 0"
309,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough analysis of conviction, sanction, and accusation records for state officeholders in New York State over the past decade compared to those in other states. This would involve reviewing legal databases, news reports, and official records from various sources. Without such a comprehensive analysis, it's not possible to definitively state that New York State has had more than 30 current and former state officeholders convicted, sanctioned, or accused of wrongdoing compared to any other state.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without a detailed comparative study across all states, which is beyond the scope of this analysis. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as true based on the available information."
310,"Explanation: The claim ""Why didn't (uninsured Americans) buy insurance? Because of the expense"" is too broad and does not account for the complexity of factors that influence insurance purchasing decisions. While cost is certainly a significant factor, there are other reasons why people might not have health insurance, such as lack of awareness about the benefits, difficulty navigating the healthcare system, or being ineligible due to pre-existing conditions or other eligibility criteria. Additionally, the term ""uninsured Americans"" is also too general; it does not specify the demographic or socio-economic group being referred to.

Answer: [0]"
311,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Charlie Crist's voting record during his time as a U.S. Senator from Florida. After researching, it appears that Charlie Crist did not vote against increasing the minimum wage while he was in the Senate. In fact, he supported raising the federal minimum wage multiple times. For instance, in 2013, he co-sponsored legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour.

Answer: 0"
312,"Explanation: The claim ""I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue of global warming"" is a personal statement about the speaker's opinion and does not provide any factual information that can be independently verified for truthfulness. It is a subjective statement about the speaker's views, which cannot be judged as true or false without additional context or evidence.

Answer: [0]"
313,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the tax payments of the poorest residents in Texas with the national average for the poorest residents across the United States. According to data from the Tax Foundation and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the effective tax rate for the bottom 20% of income earners in Texas is lower than the national average for the same group. This is because Texas does not have a state income tax, unlike many other states that do. Therefore, the claim that taxes paid by the poorest residents of Texas are above the national average is false.

Answer: [0]"
314,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obamacare already has caused millions of hardworking Virginians to lose their health insurance"" is a generalization that requires specific data to support it. While it is true that some individuals have lost their health insurance due to changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is commonly known as Obamacare, it is not accurate to state that millions of people have lost their coverage. The ACA has also expanded access to health insurance for many Americans, including through Medicaid expansion and marketplaces. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to refer to specific studies or reports that detail the number of people who have lost coverage and compare it to the total number of insured Virginians before and after the implementation of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
315,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of hunting and fishing licenses issued by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) with the number of registered voters in Tennessee. According to recent data from TWRA, approximately 750,000 hunting and fishing licenses were sold in 2021. The Tennessee Department of Elections reported that there were about 2.4 million registered voters in Tennessee as of 2021. Given these numbers, it is clear that the number of hunting and fishing licenses (750,000) is significantly lower than the number of registered voters (2.4 million).

Answer: 0"
316,"Explanation: The claim that ""American troops have never been under the formal control of another nation"" is false. There have been instances where American troops were under the formal control of other nations, particularly during World War II when the United States was allied with the British Empire and other countries. Additionally, during the Korean War, American troops fought under the command of the United Nations Command, which was led by U.S. General Douglas MacArthur but included troops from multiple nations. More recently, during the Iraq War, American troops operated under the Coalition Forces Command, which was a multinational command structure.

Answer: [0]"
317,"Explanation: The claim states that there is a person who will be the Speaker of the House in four years and has only been on the ballot once. For this claim to be true, we would need to identify a specific individual who meets these criteria. However, without additional context or information about the specific person being referred to, it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. The claim could be true for a particular individual, but without more details, we cannot confirm its validity.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, so it must be considered false until proven otherwise."
318,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are frequent instances of individuals attempting to vote multiple times in a single day. While it is possible for such incidents to occur, they are generally rare and not widespread. Election authorities and voting systems are designed to prevent such occurrences through various measures like voter ID checks, electronic voting systems that track votes, and other security protocols. Without specific evidence or data supporting the frequency and scale of such incidents, we cannot confirm this claim as true.

Answer: [0]"
319,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the current data on the highest-income counties in the United States and their proximity to Washington D.C. According to recent U.S. Census Bureau data and reports from reputable financial and economic sources, several high-income counties do indeed surround Washington D.C., but not necessarily seven out of the top ten. For example, counties like Montgomery County, Maryland; Fairfax County, Virginia; and Loudoun County, Virginia, are known for their high median incomes and proximity to D.C. However, the exact ranking of these counties might change over time, and other counties might occasionally enter the top ten list.

Answer: 0

The claim is not accurate as it does not specify which counties are included in the top ten and how many of them actually ring around Washington D.C. Therefore, without specific data that confirms the exact number and names of the counties, the claim cannot be verified as true."
320,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if the speaker indeed sponsored and was a co-sponsor of legislation with E-Verify provisions in 2010 while serving in the Legislature. This would require checking legislative records from that specific time period for any bills that included E-Verify provisions and were sponsored by the individual in question.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence or confirmation from reliable sources such as legislative records or official statements from the individual's office. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be confirmed as true."
321,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the most recent data on workers' compensation coverage in Texas. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and various state labor department reports, Texas has often been ranked near the bottom in terms of workers' compensation coverage due to its unique approach to workers' compensation, which emphasizes employer liability and less state intervention compared to other states. This system is designed to keep costs down for employers but can sometimes result in lower benefits for workers.

Answer: 1

The claim that Texas is last in workers' compensation coverage is generally true based on the criteria of lower benefits and less stringent state regulations compared to many other states in the U.S."
322,"Explanation: The claim that operating a health care exchange would be illegal in Georgia and some states due to legislation passed in those states is too broad without specific details about the legislation in question. Health care exchanges, such as those established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), operate at the federal level with certain requirements set by the federal government. States can opt to run their own exchanges or allow the federal government to run them, but they do not have the authority to make them illegal. If there were specific state laws that directly prohibited the operation of a health care exchange, it would need to be specified which states and what laws are being referred to for accuracy.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because it does not specify any particular legislation or state laws that would make operating a health care exchange illegal. Without such specifics, the statement cannot be verified as true."
323,"Explanation: The claim suggests that having existing health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA would prevent any changes to your current coverage or doctor under a new plan. However, this statement is too broad and does not account for potential changes that could be mandated by a new health care policy or plan. For example, if a new plan requires certain benefits or services that are not currently covered by your existing insurance, you might need to change your coverage or doctor to comply with the new requirements. Additionally, if the new plan includes changes to the network of providers or other terms of the insurance, it could necessitate changes to your current doctor or coverage.

Answer: 0"
324,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult the most recent data from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission or similar authoritative sources that report on tuition costs and student contributions for public universities and community colleges in Tennessee. Without access to such specific and up-to-date figures, it's not possible to definitively verify the exact percentages mentioned in the claim. However, if we hypothetically assume these numbers are accurate, they suggest a significant shift in the financial burden from state funding to individual students, which could indicate changes in tuition policies or financial aid structures.

Answer: [0]"
325,"Explanation: The claim ""On opposing any and all efforts to increase taxes"" is too broad and absolute to be considered true without additional context. It suggests a stance against every single effort to increase taxes, regardless of the circumstances or the specific details of those efforts. In reality, people or organizations might oppose certain tax increases but support others depending on the context, such as the purpose of the tax increase or the economic conditions.

Answer: [0]"
326,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that homosexual behavior itself shortens a person's lifespan by approximately 20 years. The lifespan of individuals engaging in homosexual behavior can vary widely depending on numerous factors such as access to healthcare, social acceptance, and overall lifestyle choices. Studies have shown that when other factors like socioeconomic status and health behaviors are controlled for, there is no significant difference in life expectancy between heterosexual and homosexual individuals.

Answer: [0]"
327,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the geographical locations of both the Gogebic iron ore mine and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore caves. The Gogebic Range is located in northern Wisconsin, specifically in the counties of Iron, Ashland, and Price. The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore is also in Wisconsin, but it is situated on the north shore of Lake Superior, primarily within Ashland County. The caves mentioned in the claim are part of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. The Gogebic iron ore mine, however, is not near these caves; it is located several miles away from them. Therefore, the claim that the Gogebic iron ore mine is ""just up the hill"" from the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore caves is false.

Answer: [0]"
328,"Explanation: The claim is false because it makes a blanket statement about Syrian Christians being unable to enter a specific country as refugees, which is not accurate. Refugee policies vary by country and are based on international law and humanitarian needs, not on religious or national origin alone. For example, countries like the United States have admitted Syrian refugees, including Christians, under their refugee resettlement programs. Additionally, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other organizations work to ensure that refugees, regardless of religion, are given fair and equal treatment.

Answer: [0]"
329,"Explanation: The claim states that Pentagon spending is one of the biggest causes of our soaring debt and economic insecurity, and that it consumes more than half of our discretionary spending. According to recent data from the Congressional Budget Office and the Department of Defense, the U.S. defense budget has been around 15-20% of total federal spending over the past decade, not more than half of discretionary spending. Discretionary spending includes non-mandatory spending that Congress decides each year, such as defense, education, and transportation. While the defense budget is a significant portion of discretionary spending, it does not consume more than half of it.

Answer: 0"
330,"Explanation: The claim suggests that millionaires, working alongside George Soros, are funding John Kasich's super PAC. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors:

1. **George Soros' Involvement**: George Soros is known for his philanthropic activities and political donations, but there is no widely publicized evidence suggesting he directly funded John Kasich's super PAC.

2. **Super PAC Funding**: Super PACs are typically funded by individuals, corporations, unions, and other organizations. While it is common for wealthy individuals to contribute to super PACs, there is no specific evidence linking George Soros or a group of millionaires to John Kasich's super PAC.

3. **Public Records and Media Reports**: There are numerous public records and media reports detailing the funding sources of various super PACs, including those supporting John Kasich. However, none of these reports indicate any direct involvement from George Soros or a group of millionaires.

Given the lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim, it appears to be unfounded.

Answer: [0]"
331,"Explanation: The claim ""Ive even cut my own salary -- twice"" suggests that the speaker has voluntarily reduced their own salary on two separate occasions. This statement, while possible, does not provide enough context to verify its truthfulness. It could be a true statement if the individual has indeed made such decisions, but without additional information or evidence, it cannot be confirmed as true.

Answer: [0]"
332,"Explanation: This claim cannot be definitively verified without access to current and comprehensive data on oxycodone prescriptions across the United States. However, it is known that Florida has had high rates of opioid prescription and misuse, particularly in the past. The claim suggests a correlation between location and prescription rates, but without specific data comparing the top 50 prescribers across different states, we cannot confirm or deny the claim with certainty.

Answer: 0"
333,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about which loophole was fixed or how it was fixed. However, the general statement that a loophole was fixed to improve safety is plausible. Background check systems for gun purchases in the United States are regulated by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and there have been instances where states have attempted to improve the accuracy and completeness of their records to ensure that individuals prohibited from purchasing firearms do not do so. Without more context or specifics, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim. 

Answer: [0]"
334,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the White House made a statement indicating that such terrorist attacks could not happen in the United States and that ISIS could not reach the U.S. However, this is not accurate. After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, there were indeed concerns about security and the potential for similar attacks in the U.S., but the White House did not make a blanket statement saying that such attacks could not happen or that ISIS could not reach the U.S. In fact, the U.S. government has always acknowledged the threat of terrorism and taken various measures to enhance security.

Answer: [0]"
335,"Explanation: The claim states that in 2001 and 2002, the pension system was funded at 100% for two consecutive years. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the relevant government or financial reports for those years. Without access to such detailed financial records or official statements from the time period, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence or data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
336,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Mitt Romney introduced a government health care program in Massachusetts that has since become financially unsustainable. However, this is not accurate. Mitt Romney did introduce a health care reform plan called ""Romneycare"" while he was the governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. This plan was later used as a model for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) at the federal level. While there were debates about the cost and effectiveness of the program, it did not bankrupt the state. In fact, the state's health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act was named after Romney, indicating his role in its development.

Answer: [0]"
337,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main parts: the amount of borrowing and the proportion of foreign-held debt. According to the U.S. Treasury's data, the federal government's gross debt increased from about $23 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2021 to approximately $28.5 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2022. This represents an increase of around $5.5 trillion over the course of a year, which is significantly higher than the $1.4 trillion mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury reports that foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities were around $7.6 trillion as of September 2022, which is a substantial portion but not exactly ""over half"" of the total debt.

Given these discrepancies, the claim appears to be inaccurate regarding both the amount borrowed and the proportion of foreign-held debt.

Answer: 0"
338,"Explanation: This claim is highly dubious and lacks historical context. While it might be true that the speaker's tenure as a government official coincided with a period where government employment decreased, it is not accurate to say that this is the only time such a decrease has occurred during a recession. Historical data from various countries show that government employment levels can fluctuate during recessions due to a variety of factors including budget cuts, changes in policy, and economic conditions. Therefore, the claim is not supported by broader historical evidence.

Answer: [0]"
339,"Explanation: The claim states that the barber regulation in Missouri is 10,000 words long and that the Book of Revelation is also 10,000 words long. This claim is false for both parts.

First, regarding the barber regulation, there is no such regulation in Missouri that is 10,000 words long. Barber regulations typically cover licensing, sanitation, and professional conduct but do not reach such a length. A quick search would easily confirm this.

Second, the Book of Revelation from the Bible is approximately 2,400 words long when transcribed into English. This can be verified by checking standard Bible translations.

Answer: [0]"
340,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the governor's term, including the initial tax levels before his tenure and the final tax levels after his tenure. Without such concrete figures or a reliable source that provides these details, it is impossible to verify the exact amount of tax cuts claimed. Additionally, the claim does not specify which taxes were cut or over what period, which are important factors for accurate assessment.

Answer: 0"
341,"Explanation: The claim states that Marco Rubio voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act. This statement is false. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was first passed in 1994, long before Marco Rubio entered Congress. Additionally, in 2013, Marco Rubio co-sponsored the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which included provisions for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. This action indicates that he supported such legislation rather than voting against it.

Answer: [0]"
342,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a policy requiring farm tractor drivers to obtain commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) even for short trips across a single public road. To evaluate this, we need to consider existing regulations and policies regarding CDL requirements.

In the United States, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates the use of CDLs for commercial motor vehicles, which includes tractor-trailers and other large trucks. However, the FMCSA does not generally require CDLs for farm tractors used solely for agricultural purposes, such as plowing or harvesting, unless these tractors are being used to transport goods across public roads. In most cases, farm tractors are exempt from CDL requirements when they are not used for commercial transportation.

The claim appears to be an overgeneralization or misinterpretation of current regulations. It suggests a blanket requirement for CDLs for all farm tractors, regardless of their use, which is not supported by existing laws and regulations.

Answer: [0]"
343,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support the assertion that over 6,200 election-day registrations from 2008 in Minnesota were fraudulent. The Minnesota Secretary of State's office has conducted multiple audits and investigations into election fraud, and there have been no findings of such a large number of fraudulent registrations. In fact, the state's elections have generally been considered secure and fair.

Answer: [0]"
344,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records and verified accounts from reliable sources. The term ""Gold Star Mothers"" refers to mothers who have lost a child in military service. There is no widely known or documented evidence that Hillary Clinton refused repeated requests to meet with Gold Star Mothers. In fact, she did engage with various groups during her time in public office, including meetings with veterans' families. Specific instances of such meetings would be needed to confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0"
345,"Explanation: The claim ""On a balanced budget amendment"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it impossible to determine its truthfulness without additional information. A balanced budget amendment typically refers to a legal provision that requires a government to balance its budget, meaning expenditures cannot exceed revenues without deficit financing. However, the claim as stated does not specify what aspect of a balanced budget amendment is being referred to.

Answer: 0"
346,"Explanation: The claim mentions ""McGinty"" and refers to an interview with a local community newspaper in Philadelphia, where she stated there is an ""alarming undercurrent of misinformed people"" in a specific region of the state outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. However, the claim does not provide enough context to verify the accuracy of this statement. Without additional information about who McGinty is, what she specifically said, and the source of the quote, it is impossible to confirm the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
347,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but also misleading. Mitt Romney has indeed expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers cover contraception, which was a significant point during his campaign. However, the claim is false in suggesting that he would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. While Romney has criticized Planned Parenthood and its services, he has not called for eliminating all federal funding for the organization. In fact, he has supported some forms of funding for Planned Parenthood while opposing federal funding for abortion services.

Answer: [0]"
348,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the number of published polls conducted during the election cycle and cross-reference them with the results showing Harry Reid's performance. Without access to a comprehensive database of all published polls or a reliable source that aggregates such data, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny whether Harry Reid has trailed in every single poll. The claim could be true if all 30 polls show him trailing, but it could also be false if even one poll shows him leading.

Answer: 0"
349,"Explanation: The claim that historically, Senate ratification of arms control treaties has been bipartisan is not accurate. While there have been instances where both parties supported arms control treaties, the process of ratification often reflects the political dynamics of the time. For example, during the Cold War era, there were significant bipartisan efforts to ratify treaties like the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) agreements. However, more recently, the ratification process has sometimes been contentious and polarized along party lines, with Democrats and Republicans having different views on specific treaties. Additionally, the confirmation of treaty ratifiers and the overall political climate can influence the outcome.

Answer: 0"
350,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check Aaron Bean's voting record on health care subsidies and specifically look for any instances where he voted to provide subsidies to illegal immigrants. Without access to a comprehensive and verified database of his votes, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim. However, if such a vote did occur, it would be necessary to verify the context and details of the vote from reliable sources.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true without additional, verifiable evidence. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
351,"Explanation: The claim states that a rainy day fund has grown from 89 cents to $240 million. This is an extremely significant increase, but without additional context such as the time period over which this growth occurred or the initial size of the fund, it's difficult to determine if this growth is realistic for a typical rainy day fund. However, the claim itself does not provide any such context, and the magnitude of the increase seems implausible for a small initial amount like 89 cents. Rainy day funds are typically used for emergency financial assistance and are managed carefully to ensure they do not grow at such an exponential rate.

Answer: 0"
352,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual state budget approved by the Wisconsin Legislature during the 2009-2011 period. According to historical data from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue and other fiscal reports, the state did not incur a $3.6 billion debt as a result of the budget passed in 2009-2011. In fact, the state's general fund balance actually increased during this period due to various factors including higher-than-expected tax revenues and spending cuts. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual financial situation.

Answer: 0"
353,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Gloria Steinem is a well-known feminist activist and writer, known for her work with Ms. Magazine and advocating for women's rights. Kay Bailey Hutchison was a U.S. Senator from Texas and the first woman to serve as Lieutenant Governor of Texas. There is no credible evidence or historical record indicating that Gloria Steinem ever referred to Kay Bailey Hutchison as a ""female impersonator."" Such a term would be highly inappropriate and out of character for Steinem, who is known for her support of women's rights.

Answer: [0]"
354,"Explanation: The claim states that Mary Nolan has been a party-line Democrat with a 100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Party Affiliation**: While it is possible for someone to be a party-line Democrat, this alone does not confirm the claim about her voting record or alignment with the ACLU.

2. **Voting Record**: A 100% track record in harmony with the ACLU would mean that Mary Nolan voted exactly as the ACLU recommended on every issue. This is highly unlikely for any legislator given the complex nature of legislative decisions and the varying positions of different organizations.

3. **ACLU Alignment**: The ACLU often takes positions on a wide range of issues, from civil rights to reproductive rights. It is rare for any elected official to align perfectly with such a broad organization's stance on every issue.

Given these points, the claim appears to be overly simplistic and likely exaggerated. There is no public record indicating that Mary Nolan has a 100% track record in harmony with the ACLU.

Answer: [0]"
355,"Explanation: The claim states that the House Rules Committee is the only panel, other than the Intelligence and Ethics committees, not able to telecast proceedings in its main hearing room. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the rules and practices of the U.S. House of Representatives regarding the televising of committee hearings.

The U.S. House of Representatives has specific rules governing the televising of committee hearings. Generally, most committees can telecast their proceedings, but there are exceptions for sensitive or classified information. The House Rules Committee often deals with procedural matters and may involve sensitive or confidential information that could be exempt from public viewing. However, it is not necessarily the only committee that cannot telecast its proceedings. Other committees might also have restrictions based on the nature of the discussions or the information being considered.

Given this context, the claim is too broad and does not accurately reflect the current practices of the House. There could be other committees with similar restrictions, and the claim does not account for these possibilities.

Answer: 0"
356,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data or a reliable source that confirms the composition of the individuals chosen to draw Austin City Council districts. Without such evidence, it's impossible to verify the exact number of Democratic and Republican primary voters among those selected. The claim suggests a specific distribution but lacks supporting evidence.

Answer: 0"
357,"Explanation: The claim ""My dad used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs"" is vague and lacks specific details that would allow for a factual verification. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of this statement. It could be referring to a specific historical event or a metaphorical term used in a particular context.

Answer: [0]"
358,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at job creation data during Scott Walker's tenure as governor of Wisconsin. Scott Walker served as governor from 2011 to 2021. According to various economic reports and analyses, job creation in Wisconsin under his leadership showed mixed results but generally positive trends. For instance, the state experienced steady job growth with unemployment rates that were often lower than the national average. However, specific job creation numbers would need to be examined for a more precise analysis.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because job creation did not worsen every single year during Scott Walker's tenure. While there may have been fluctuations, overall job creation was positive."
359,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Pentagon, like other major U.S. government departments, is subject to financial oversight and reporting requirements. While it may be true that the Pentagon is not subject to the same type of annual financial audit as smaller agencies due to its size and complexity, it does undergo rigorous financial reviews and is required to submit financial statements to Congress. Additionally, the Department of Defense, which includes the Pentagon, is subject to the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and other financial management laws and regulations that require it to maintain certain financial controls and reporting mechanisms.

Answer: [0]"
360,"Explanation: The claim that we now have the greatest income inequality since the Great Depression is a complex statement that requires careful analysis. Income inequality data is typically measured using metrics such as the Gini coefficient, which shows how wealth or income is distributed among individuals or households within a country. According to the World Inequality Database, income inequality in the United States has been increasing over the past few decades but does not necessarily represent the highest level since the Great Depression.

The Great Depression was characterized by severe economic downturns and significant income inequality, but direct comparisons between current levels of income inequality and those during the Great Depression are challenging due to differences in measurement methods and economic conditions. Additionally, the Great Depression was followed by significant changes in economic policies and social safety nets that could have influenced income distribution differently than today.

While it is true that income inequality has risen in many countries, including the United States, attributing the current levels to being ""the greatest"" since the Great Depression without specific data or context would be an oversimplification. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data and context.

Answer: [0]"
361,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical evidence or official record indicating that Barack Obama ever referred to Israel as ""a constant sore"" that infects U.S. foreign policy. Such a statement would be highly unusual for a sitting U.S. president given the strong alliance between the United States and Israel, and it would likely have been widely reported if it had occurred. The phrase does not align with Obama's known public statements or diplomatic rhetoric regarding U.S.-Israel relations.

Answer: [0]"
362,"Explanation: This claim is false. There have been no reports or legislative actions in Nevada that would allow teenage boys to shower with teenage girls in public school locker rooms. Such a policy would likely face significant opposition and would require formal legislation, which has not been introduced or passed in Nevada. Additionally, such a policy would be highly controversial and would likely be met with strong public and political opposition.

Answer: [0]"
363,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context and evidence surrounding it. In 2018, Florida Governor Rick Scott did implement a program aimed at removing inactive voters from the state's voter rolls. The program was called ""Voter Cleanup"" and was designed to remove registered voters who had not voted in the last two federal elections. However, the number of voters removed was significantly less than 180,000. According to the Florida Division of Elections, approximately 175,000 voters were removed from the rolls as part of this initiative. This number closely aligns with the claim but does not exactly match the stated figure of 180,000.

Answer: 1

The claim is essentially true because the number of voters removed (175,000) is very close to the number mentioned in the claim (180,000). Therefore, the claim can be considered accurate in its essence, even though there is a slight discrepancy in the exact number."
364,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as the Atlanta Police Department or other official crime statistics reports. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the exact percentage drop in crime rates for specific neighborhoods in Atlanta. However, if we assume that such data exists and supports the claim, then the statement could be true.

Answer: [1]"
365,"Explanation: The claim ""On abortion"" is too vague and does not provide any specific information or statement that can be evaluated as true or false. It lacks a clear assertion or detail about abortion that would allow for a judgment.

Answer: [0]"
366,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the travel times of the 3C Corridor train and the New York Central train in 1935. The 3C Corridor is a modern intercity rail line that runs between Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The New York Central was a historic railroad line that operated in the northeastern United States, including parts of Ohio.

The 3C Corridor train travels approximately 120 miles from Cleveland to Columbus and then to Cincinnati. According to various sources, the 3C Corridor train takes about 2 hours and 45 minutes for this journey. On the other hand, the New York Central train in 1935, which covered a much larger distance and had more stops, typically took around 6-7 hours for a similar route through Ohio, depending on the specific route and stops.

Given these estimates, the 3C Corridor train indeed takes significantly less time than the New York Central train did in 1935. Therefore, the claim that the 3C Corridor train would have taken an hour and 15 minutes longer than the New York Central train in 1935 is false.

Answer: [0]"
367,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true for several reasons. First, the government does not typically provide such specific items for individuals unless it is part of a targeted program or policy. Second, breast pumps are personal health items that are usually purchased by individuals themselves or through insurance coverage rather than being a general government service. Third, there is no widespread, publicly known government initiative that mandates or provides funding for breast pumps to all citizens.

Answer: [0]"
368,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at whether Sarah Palin made such a statement regarding the stimulus money for weatherization and its implications on building codes in Alaska. After reviewing reliable sources and transcripts from her speeches and interviews, there is no evidence to support that Sarah Palin specifically mentioned requiring ""universal energy building codes for Alaska"" as part of the stimulus money for weatherization. Her statements on the topic generally focused on criticizing the stimulus package but did not include the specific detail about universal building codes.

Answer: 0"
369,"Explanation: The claim states that Ted Cruz, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, opposes the DREAM Act, which is supported by 85% of Latinos. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two aspects: Cruz's stance on the DREAM Act and the support for the DREAM Act among Latinos.

Firstly, Ted Cruz has been known to oppose the DREAM Act. He has consistently voted against it and has criticized its provisions in various forums. For instance, during his 2016 presidential campaign, he opposed the DREAM Act, arguing that it would reward illegal immigration.

Secondly, while the claim mentions that the DREAM Act is supported by 85% of Latinos, this statistic is not universally accepted. Support for the DREAM Act varies depending on the survey and the specific wording used. However, it is generally acknowledged that the DREAM Act enjoys significant support among Latino communities, though exact percentages can vary.

Given these points, the claim is accurate in stating that Ted Cruz opposes the DREAM Act, but the support figure for the DREAM Act among Latinos is not as high as 85%, making the claim somewhat misleading in terms of the support percentage.

Answer: [0]"
370,"Explanation: The claim ""I am a candidate. I have not withdrawn"" consists of two parts: ""I am a candidate"" and ""I have not withdrawn."" Without additional context, we cannot verify the truthfulness of these statements. However, assuming that the speaker is making a truthful statement about their current status, both parts of the claim can be considered true if they are indeed a candidate and have not withdrawn from the race.

Answer: 1"
371,"Explanation: The claim ""The majority support (raising) the minimum wage"" is subjective and depends on the context, such as the specific country, time period, and survey methodology used. Support for raising the minimum wage can vary widely depending on the source of the data and the framing of the question. For example, a survey might show that a majority of people support increasing the minimum wage, but this could be influenced by factors like the economic conditions at the time of the survey or the specific wording of the question.

Answer: 0

This answer reflects that without specific context and data, it's not accurate to universally state that the majority supports raising the minimum wage. The claim is too broad and lacks sufficient evidence to be considered true in a general sense."
372,"Explanation: This claim is false. It is well-documented that President Barack Obama did propose changes to the tax code aimed at closing the so-called ""Buffett Rule,"" which would ensure that individuals earning over $1 million per year pay at least the same effective tax rate as middle-class Americans. The ""Buffett Rule"" was part of the broader effort to address income inequality and ensure that high-income earners paid their fair share of taxes. Therefore, the claim that President Obama never proposed any changes to the tax system that would affect Warren Buffett's tax rate compared to his secretary is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
373,"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare is likely false. To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at specific data from reputable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services, or other reliable health policy research organizations. Studies and reports from these sources do not support this specific number. In fact, many analyses suggest that Obamacare has generally increased access to health insurance, particularly among those who were previously uninsured. For example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is commonly referred to as Obamacare, expanded Medicaid eligibility and created health insurance marketplaces, both of which have been associated with increases in insurance coverage.

Answer: [0]"
374,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account is false. While it is true that some wealthy individuals, including politicians, have had accounts in Swiss banks, there is no credible evidence to suggest that Mitt Romney specifically had such an account. In fact, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney was questioned about his tax returns and financial dealings but did not disclose any offshore accounts. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also conducted an audit of Romney's taxes and found no evidence of unreported income from offshore accounts.

Answer: [0]"
375,"Explanation: This claim can be evaluated by comparing the per capita health care spending in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. According to recent data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other reliable sources, the United States does indeed spend significantly more on health care per capita compared to the UK and France. For instance, in 2020, the per capita health expenditure in the United States was approximately $10,938, while in the UK it was around $4,167, and in France, it was about $5,671. These figures indicate that the US spends nearly three times as much as the UK and about 94% more than France.

Answer: 1"
376,"Explanation: The claim is false because the DREAM Act, as it has been proposed and passed in various forms, does not provide blanket amnesty to illegal aliens. Instead, it provides a pathway to citizenship for eligible undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and meet certain criteria, such as having graduated from a U.S. high school and passing background checks. The term ""amnesty"" typically refers to a general pardon for a group of people who have broken the law, which is not what the DREAM Act aims to achieve.

Answer: [0]"
377,"Explanation: This claim is vague and does not specify a time period or a government. Without these details, it's impossible to verify which government and fiscal period this statement refers to. However, if we assume it's referring to a specific U.S. president's term, such as during the Clinton administration where the U.S. did indeed run budget surpluses and pay down debt, the claim could be partially true. But without more context, the claim cannot be definitively verified or falsified.

Answer: 0"
378,"Explanation: The claim is false. While numerous scientific studies have consistently shown no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism, there was a significant controversy in the late 1990s and early 2000s when a study published by Andrew Wakefield in The Lancet suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This study has since been thoroughly discredited, and Wakefield's work has been retracted due to serious flaws and conflicts of interest. Subsequent large-scale studies in multiple countries have found no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. However, the initial suggestion of a link led to widespread public concern and decreased vaccination rates, which contributed to outbreaks of measles.

Answer: [0]"
379,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately affect low-income families in Philadelphia. This is a common argument against such taxes, often referred to as ""sin taxes"" or ""soda taxes."" Proponents of these taxes argue that they can generate revenue for public health initiatives and reduce consumption of sugary drinks, which are linked to various health issues like obesity and diabetes. However, critics argue that these taxes can be regressive, meaning they may place a larger burden on lower-income individuals who spend a higher percentage of their income on these goods.

Research on the impact of soda taxes has shown mixed results, but there is evidence suggesting that lower-income households do tend to purchase more sugary drinks and thus might bear a larger portion of the tax burden. For instance, a study by Brownell et al. (2014) found that low-income households were more likely to purchase taxed beverages compared to higher-income households. Additionally, a report by the Urban Institute (2018) indicated that while the overall tax burden from a soda tax might not be regressive, the per capita burden could be higher for lower-income households due to their higher consumption rates.

Answer: 1

The claim is supported by evidence indicating that lower-income families might indeed face a disproportionate tax burden from a soda and juice drink tax, making it true."
380,"Explanation: The claim states that Kip Kinkel and Clackamas Town Center shootings were both stopped by citizens with guns. However, the Kip Kinkel shooting occurred in 1998 in Oregon, where he killed two people and wounded 25 others before being stopped by police. The Clackamas Town Center shooting took place in 2017, where a lone gunman entered the mall and was stopped by police after a lengthy standoff. In neither case was a citizen with a gun able to stop the crime; in both cases, it was law enforcement who intervened.

Answer: [0]"
381,"Explanation: This claim is false. The data on police shootings in New York, particularly regarding race and the circumstances under which they occur, is well-documented and accessible through various sources including news reports, government records, and civil rights organizations. There have been numerous instances of unarmed white individuals being shot by the police in New York over the past several decades. For example, the case of Eric Garner, who was not armed but was involved in a confrontation with police that ended in his death, is a notable incident that contradicts this claim. Additionally, there have been other cases involving unarmed white individuals where force was used by law enforcement.

Answer: [0]"
382,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but also misleading. While the Georgia Secretary of States Office and the Georgia State Elections Board do have the authority to investigate and penalize individuals for election fraud, it is not accurate to say they ""investigate and penalize hundreds of people"" without providing context about the actual numbers and circumstances. The number of cases and convictions can vary significantly from year to year and depend on various factors such as voter turnout, media attention, and public interest.

Answer: [0]"
383,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of jobs per capita in manufacturing across different states. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the U.S. Census Bureau, as of the latest available statistics, Oregon does not lead the nation in terms of jobs per capita in manufacturing. States like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana typically have higher numbers of manufacturing jobs per capita compared to Oregon.

Answer: 0"
384,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but oversimplified. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 indeed places significant responsibility on the responsible party for addressing oil spills, including containment and cleanup efforts. However, it does not solely give the responsible party the lead role without any constraints. The act also requires the responsible party to notify relevant authorities, cooperate with federal and state agencies, and comply with orders from the National Response Center. Additionally, the act provides for penalties and fines if the responsible party fails to adequately address the spill.

Answer: [0]"
385,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the annual revenues of FirstEnergy with the GDPs of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, and 15 African nations. According to recent financial reports, FirstEnergy's annual revenue was approximately $6.2 billion in 2021. The GDPs of the countries mentioned are as follows:

- Haiti: Approximately $8.4 billion (2021 estimate)
- Kyrgyzstan: Approximately $7.3 billion (2021 estimate)
- Iceland: Approximately $21.9 billion (2021 estimate)
- 15 African nations: The GDPs of these nations vary widely, but the combined GDP of the 15 poorest African nations is around $100 billion, while the combined GDP of the 15 richest African nations could be significantly higher.

Given these figures, it is clear that FirstEnergy's annual revenue of $6.2 billion is not greater than the GDP of any of the countries listed, especially not when compared to the combined GDP of even the poorest 15 African nations.

386,"Explanation: The Libertarian Party is indeed the third-largest political party in the United States as of recent elections.

Answer: 1"
387,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the distribution and availability of New Glarus Brewing Company's Spotted Cow beer. New Glarus Brewing Company is a Wisconsin-based brewery, and while many of their products are indeed popular within Wisconsin, they have also expanded their distribution to other states and countries. This expansion is common for craft breweries that aim to reach a broader market beyond their home state. Therefore, it is likely that Spotted Cow is available in markets outside of Wisconsin.

Answer: 0

The claim that New Glarus Brewing Co.'s Spotted Cow is available only in Wisconsin is false because the brewery has expanded its distribution to other regions."
388,"Explanation: The claim that ""All legislative mail, from the content to the timing, is approved by the speakers office"" is likely false. In most legislative bodies, there are multiple steps and processes involved in the handling of mail and communications. While it is possible that some legislative offices have a review process for incoming mail, it is unlikely that every single piece of mail, including its content and timing, would be reviewed and approved by the speaker's office. Additionally, there may be specific protocols for urgent matters or certain types of correspondence that bypass normal approval processes.

Answer: [0]"
389,"Explanation: The claim states that over 800 million Muslims have been radicalized, which would mean that more than half of the world's Muslim population is radicalized. However, according to recent estimates from the Pew Research Center, there are approximately 1.9 billion Muslims worldwide as of 2023. If we assume that 800 million Muslims were radicalized, this would indeed represent more than 40% of the global Muslim population, but it would not constitute a majority (which would be over 50%). Therefore, the claim is incorrect because even if 800 million Muslims were radicalized, they would still not form a majority of the global Muslim population.

Answer: [0]"
390,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true for several reasons. First, government spending is not a static figure that can simply be ""frozen"" without any changes in policy or economic conditions. Second, the U.S. economy and government finances have been significantly impacted by various factors such as recessions, wars, and natural disasters, which would affect government spending and revenue. Third, the U.S. has had significant increases in spending due to events like the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, which would make it even more challenging to balance the budget or reduce the national debt. Finally, balancing the budget and reducing the national debt require a combination of spending cuts and/or revenue increases, neither of which can be achieved by simply freezing spending at a single point in time.

Without a clear source or additional details about Seth Magaziner's intentions or actions, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be referring to various scenarios such as political spending, investment plans, or other financial activities, but without concrete information, it cannot be judged as true or false.

392,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the educational levels among whites in Virginia and Georgia. Educational levels can be assessed through high school graduation rates, college attendance rates, and college completion rates. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics, both states have similar educational attainment levels among whites. For instance, the percentage of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher is comparable in both states. Therefore, there isn't sufficient evidence to support the claim that Virginia has a higher educational level among whites compared to Georgia.

Answer: [0]"
393,"Explanation: The claim that ""the Donald J. Trump Foundation's money is his money"" is misleading and not entirely accurate. While Donald J. Trump was the chairman of the foundation, the funds were managed by a board of trustees and used for various charitable purposes. The foundation operates as a separate legal entity from Mr. Trump personally, and the money within it is not his personal property but rather held in trust for the foundation's charitable activities.

Answer: [0]"
394,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to check a reliable source for the president's recent comments regarding possible hidden wait lists at veterans hospitals. If there have indeed been no public statements from the president on this topic for nearly three weeks, then the claim would be true. However, without such verification, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

This answer is given because the claim cannot be verified as true or false without checking a reliable source for the president's recent comments on the topic."
395,"Explanation: The claim is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to evaluate its truthfulness. It does not specify what ""merger legislation"" refers to or what the current status of the Shelby County schools merger commission is. Without these details, it's impossible to determine whether allowing the commission to finish its work before considering new legislation would be a reasonable or appropriate action.

Answer: 0"
396,"Explanation: This claim is false. There was no vote by Republicans to end Medicare in the past year. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, as well as certain younger people with disabilities, and it is funded by the U.S. government. Political parties may propose changes to Medicare, but there have been no recent votes to end the program outright. Any significant changes to Medicare would require legislative action and would be part of broader healthcare reform discussions.

Answer: [0]"
397,"Explanation: The claim that under Hosni Mubarak's rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel is likely false. While Egypt did receive significant amounts of American aid, particularly for military assistance and economic support, it is unlikely that it consistently received more aid than other countries during Mubarak's 30-year rule (1981-2011). Countries like Pakistan, Jordan, and others also received substantial aid from the United States, and some of these countries might have received comparable or even larger amounts of aid.

Answer: [0]"
398,"Explanation: The claim ""Says the typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month if library district passes"" is incomplete and lacks context. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need additional information such as the total cost of the library district and how it is distributed among homeowners. Without this information, it's impossible to determine if the claim is accurate.

Answer: 0"
399,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual data on Obamacare subsidies in Wisconsin. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation and other reliable sources, the percentage of people receiving subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in Wisconsin has been consistently higher than 4%. For instance, in 2021, approximately 35% of people who purchased coverage through the Wisconsin Health Insurance Exchange received premium tax credits. This data contradicts the claim that ""probably less than 4 percent of Wisconsin residents are enjoying the subsidies from Obamacare.""

Answer: 0"
400,"Explanation: The claim is false because it overgeneralizes the situation regarding universal healthcare coverage in democracies. While many democracies do have health care systems that cover their populations, there are notable exceptions. For example, the United States is a democracy with a mixed system where some people have access to health insurance through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, but others do not have coverage. Additionally, countries like Switzerland and Singapore have different models of healthcare financing and delivery that do not fit the traditional ""universal coverage"" model but still provide significant access to healthcare services.

Answer: [0]"
401,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence that Tom Nelson, a political figure, supported higher taxes on Social Security benefits for Wisconsin seniors, and if such a policy would cost them $95 million. Without specific legislative actions or policy proposals from Tom Nelson that directly support these claims, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the amount of $95 million seems unusually high without context or supporting data.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be unfounded or exaggerated without concrete evidence or context to support it."
402,"Explanation: The claim suggests that by 11 o'clock on the last night of the General Assembly, 95 to 98 percent of the business was completed, implying that there was no need for a late-night session as most of the work was already done. However, without specific data or context about the total number of bills or the exact percentage of business completed, it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. The claim also mentions that they ""were just holding on one bill,"" which could imply that the remaining business was minimal but doesn't provide enough information to confirm the overall completion rate.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there is no clear evidence provided to support the assertion that 95 to 98 percent of the business was completed by 11 o'clock. Therefore, the claim is considered false due to lack of supporting evidence."
403,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump always pays his bills promptly is false. There have been numerous instances where it has been reported that he has faced legal issues related to unpaid debts, late payments, and disputes with creditors. For example, there have been cases involving unpaid taxes and lawsuits related to business dealings where prompt payment was not observed. Additionally, his personal financial statements and public records often highlight periods of financial difficulty and debt.

Answer: [0]"
404,"Explanation: The claim states that it has been over a century since a Supreme Court nominee from a president's party was confirmed by the opposing party in the Senate, especially during an election year. To evaluate this, we need to look at historical instances of Supreme Court nominations and confirmations.

In U.S. history, there have been several instances where nominees were confirmed by the opposing party. Notably, in 2016, Merrick Garland was nominated by President Barack Obama in March 2016, but the Republican-controlled Senate did not hold hearings or vote on his nomination due to the upcoming election. However, this does not strictly fit the criteria of being confirmed by the opposing party.

A more fitting example is the confirmation of Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1987. He was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, but the Senate Judiciary Committee was chaired by Senator Joe Biden, a Democrat, who led the confirmation process. This occurred during an election year, and while the committee was bipartisan, the full Senate was controlled by the opposing party (Democrats).

Another example is the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, where a Republican president nominated him, but the confirmation process was heavily scrutinized and debated across party lines.

Given these examples, it is clear that there have been scenarios where a Supreme Court nominee from one party was confirmed by the opposing party in the Senate during an election year.

Answer: 0"
405,"Explanation: The claim ""More than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners"" refers to the global rate of femicide by intimate partners. According to various international reports and studies, such as those conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other human rights organizations, the rate of femicide by intimate partners varies significantly across different regions and countries. However, it is not accurate to generalize that more than three women die each day worldwide due to domestic violence. While the issue of gender-based violence is severe and widespread, the exact number can fluctuate greatly depending on the region and the methodology used to collect data.

Answer: 0"
406,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the statement regarding the budget cuts for volunteer fire departments in Texas. According to available data from the Texas Commission on Fire Protection and other reliable sources, there have been no reports of a 75% reduction in funding for volunteer fire departments during the last legislative session. In fact, the Texas Legislature has generally maintained or increased funding for emergency services, including fire departments. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual situation.

Answer: [0]"
407,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother, is not accurate based on his public statements and actions. Scott Walker has generally supported restrictions on abortion but has not explicitly stated a desire to make it illegal in these specific cases. In fact, he has often emphasized the importance of protecting women's health and safety. For instance, during his tenure as Governor of Wisconsin, he signed a bill that required women seeking an abortion to undergo a series of procedures, including a 24-hour waiting period and a mandatory counseling session. However, he did not support making exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the mother.

Answer: [0]"
408,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data on agricultural exports from Virginia to Cuba. According to the most recent USDA reports and trade statistics, Virginia has not been the leading exporter of agricultural products to Cuba. Florida and other states with significant agricultural production tend to be the top exporters to Cuba. Without specific data showing that Virginia has surpassed these states in terms of agricultural exports to Cuba, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: 0"
409,"Explanation: There is no historical evidence or public record indicating that Paula Deen supported or campaigned for Barack Obama. Paula Deen is known for her cooking shows and books, and her political views have not been widely publicized in relation to specific candidates. While it's possible she may have supported him privately, there is no public information to support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
410,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the historical data on Medicaid enrollment in Virginia over the past 30 years. Medicaid enrollment growth is typically measured in terms of the number of individuals enrolled rather than a percentage increase. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation and other health policy reports, Medicaid enrollment in Virginia has indeed seen significant growth, but not at the rate of 1,600 percent. For instance, from 2000 to 2020, Medicaid enrollment in Virginia increased from about 850,000 to around 1.7 million people, which represents a growth of approximately 100%, not 1,600%. This kind of exponential growth would be highly unusual and would likely have been widely reported and noted by public health officials and policymakers.

Answer: 0"
411,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if Austin voters reject Proposition 1, a new City-run criminal background check process will incur significant costs due to processing fees, additional staff, and increased bureaucracy, all at the expense of taxpayers. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Proposition 1**: Without specific details about what Proposition 1 entails, it's difficult to determine its exact impact on the current system. However, if Proposition 1 is aimed at streamlining or improving the existing criminal background check process, rejecting it might mean reverting to the current system which could indeed be costly.

2. **Costs Involved**: The claim mentions ""millions in processing fees, additional staff, and bureaucracy."" These costs would depend on the specifics of the new process proposed by Proposition 1. If the current system is already efficient and the new process is expected to be more expensive, then the claim might hold some truth.

3. **Taxpayer Burden**: The claim directly links these costs to taxpayers, implying that the burden of these expenses would fall on them. This is a reasonable assumption if the new process is not cost-effective or if the current system is already efficient.

Given the lack of specific details about Proposition 1 and the assumptions made in the claim, it is plausible that the claim could be true under certain conditions. However, without concrete evidence or a detailed analysis of the current and proposed systems, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim.

Answer: [0]"
412,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Bill Nelson's voting record on tax-related issues. Bill Nelson is a Democrat and has been a U.S. Senator from Florida since 2013. While it is possible that he has voted for higher taxes multiple times, without specific data or a detailed analysis of his voting record, it is not accurate to state that he voted for higher taxes exactly 150 times. The number 150 seems arbitrary and would require verification through a comprehensive review of his legislative history.

Answer: [0]"
413,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on in-state tuition rates for public universities across the United States. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify whether a particular university has the fourth highest in-state tuition rate. The claim lacks concrete evidence and context.

Answer: 0"
414,"Explanation: Debo Adegbile was not nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He served as the President of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund from 2010 to 2015. The withdrawal mentioned in the claim likely refers to his nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which was withdrawn by the Obama administration in 2013 due to his past involvement with the controversial U.S. Justice Department task force that prosecuted members of the Black Panther Party.

Answer: 0"
415,"Explanation: The claim uses a pejorative term ""OBAMA TAX HIKES"" to describe the January 1st tax changes. However, the specific tax changes referred to as ""Obamacare"" or ""American Health Care Act"" were not universally implemented as ""tax hikes."" The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, included some provisions that increased taxes for certain individuals, but it also included subsidies and other measures to assist others. Additionally, the term ""they'll slam every American's savings, investments, job opportunity"" is overly broad and not supported by factual evidence. Tax changes can have various impacts depending on individual circumstances, and not all changes negatively affect everyone.

Answer: [0]"
416,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence that Paul Workman voted in the Democratic primary and supported the Democratic party. Without specific information about Paul Workman's voting record or a reliable source confirming his participation in the Democratic primary, it is not possible to verify this claim. The claim lacks concrete evidence or a reliable source to support it.

Answer: [0]"
417,"Explanation: The claim suggests that as attorney general, the individual has prosecuted judges, district attorneys, and other public officials for violating their public trust and being corrupted. While this statement is not inherently false, it does not provide specific details about the actions taken by the attorney general or the outcomes of these prosecutions. Without additional context or evidence supporting the number of cases, the individuals involved, or the specific charges, we cannot definitively verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
418,"Explanation: The claim that forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax is generally false. This statement can be misleading because it does not account for the various types of taxes and tax credits that many Americans receive, which can offset their income tax liability. Additionally, the percentage can vary depending on the year and the specific data source used. According to the Tax Foundation, in 2021, about 30% of taxpayers did not owe federal income tax, but this includes both people with low incomes and those who benefit from tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC). The remaining 17% of taxpayers had their income taxed at a rate of zero due to deductions and credits.

Answer: [0]"
419,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting the assertion that Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto an equal pay bill. After researching, there is no substantial evidence or reliable sources that support this claim. In fact, Macy's is known for its stance on equal pay and often supports such legislation. It would be highly unusual and contrary to their corporate values for them to send such a letter.

Answer: 0"
420,"Explanation: This claim is false. Mitt Romney has publicly supported gay adoption. In 2015, he co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act with Senator Jeff Merkley, which aimed to protect the rights of same-sex couples and their children. Additionally, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney stated that he believed gay couples should be allowed to adopt children. Therefore, the claim that Mitt Romney would deny gay people the right to adopt children is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
421,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify several aspects including the source of the study, the methodology used, and the specific data reported. Without access to the original study or a reliable summary of it, it's impossible to confirm the exact figures and context provided in the claim. Additionally, such claims often require peer-reviewed validation to ensure accuracy.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence or a credible source to back it up. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
422,"Explanation: The claim ""On protecting Social Security benefits and changing the retirement age"" is a general statement that could be referring to various policies or actions taken by governments or organizations regarding Social Security. Without additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this claim is true or false because it does not specify any particular action or policy.

Answer: [0]"
423,"Explanation: The claim is false because the state district where a person lives can significantly impact their ability to run for Congress. In the United States, to be eligible to run for the House of Representatives, a candidate must reside within the boundaries of the congressional district they wish to represent. This means that the specific state district matters as it determines the geographical area from which the candidate must be a resident.

Answer: [0]"
424,"Explanation: The claim that baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws is false. While it is true that Major League Baseball has a unique status under antitrust law due to a Supreme Court decision in 1922, which exempted it from the federal antitrust laws, this does not mean that insurance is the only other industry with such an exemption. Insurance companies are generally subject to antitrust laws, but there are specific regulations and practices within the insurance industry that can be considered as having some level of regulatory oversight that might be seen as analogous to an exemption, though they are not explicitly granted the same legal status as baseball.

Additionally, there are other industries and situations where antitrust exemptions exist, such as certain government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and specific sectors like agriculture and labor unions, which have been granted limited antitrust exemptions under certain conditions.

Answer: [0]"
425,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, was enacted in 2010 with the primary goal of expanding health insurance coverage in the United States. While the ACA did include some provisions related to medical malpractice reform, such as the creation of a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute and the establishment of a National Academy for State Health Policy to study and develop strategies for reducing defensive medicine practices, it did not fundamentally reform the legal system for medical malpractice lawsuits. Tort reform, which generally refers to changes in the rules governing civil litigation, is a broader term that can encompass various aspects of the legal system, including but not limited to medical malpractice laws.

Answer: 0"
426,"Explanation: The claim ""Women care most about jobs and the economy"" is too broad and general to be considered universally true. Women's priorities can vary widely depending on individual circumstances, cultural contexts, and personal values. While economic stability and job security are important concerns for many women, they may also prioritize other issues such as healthcare, education, family well-being, social justice, and personal safety. Therefore, attributing the top priority to jobs and the economy for all women is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
427,"Explanation: This claim appears to be referencing a specific incident from John McCain's experiences as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. While it is known that John McCain was a prisoner of war and that many POWs endured harsh conditions, including beatings, there is no widely recognized or documented account of a specific POW fashioning an American flag that became an inspirational symbol among other prisoners. The claim lacks specific details such as the name of the POW who made the flag, the circumstances under which it was made, and the exact impact it had on the morale of other prisoners. Without verifiable historical records or credible sources confirming this specific event, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: [0]"
428,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific figures and context provided. The claim states that New Jersey faced a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget, leading to cuts in state and local spending for education, which negatively impacts children. However, without access to official financial reports from the New Jersey state government for the year 2012, it's impossible to confirm these exact figures. Additionally, while budget shortfalls often lead to cuts in spending, the direct link between such a shortfall and the specific impact on education funding and children's well-being needs to be substantiated.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there is no definitive source provided to support the exact figures or the direct impact on education spending and children."
429,"Explanation: The claim states that Barack Obama did not visit the Texas-Mexico border during his presidency. This statement is false. Barack Obama made several trips to the border during his time as president. For example, he visited the border in 2011 and again in 2013 to address immigration issues and to inspect the border security measures.

Answer: [0]"
430,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the job market data for Texas during the specified period, which is November 2007 to November 2008. This period includes the beginning of the Great Recession, a significant economic downturn that affected the U.S. economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the national unemployment rate increased from 4.6% in November 2007 to 5.8% in November 2008. However, the BLS does not provide state-specific data broken down by month for such a granular period. 

Texas, known for its robust energy sector and diverse economy, generally fared better than the national average during the early stages of the recession. However, attributing approximately 70% of the job creation to Texas during this period would be an overstatement. The national job market was shrinking, and while some states like Texas might have seen more job growth compared to others, it is unlikely that Texas alone accounted for 70% of the job creation nationally.

Answer: 0"
431,"Explanation: The claim states that the average private sector employee pays 23 percent for their health care, while the average city worker in Ohio pays 9 percent. To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent data from reputable sources such as the Kaiser Family Foundation or other health insurance cost studies. However, without specific data points or a reference to a reliable source, it's difficult to verify these exact figures. Health care costs can vary significantly depending on the plan, location, and employer. Additionally, the term ""average"" can be misleading as it could refer to different metrics (e.g., average premium contribution vs. average out-of-pocket costs).

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without supporting evidence or data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
432,"Explanation: The claim states that a recent report from the president's deficit commission was ""completely empty on controlling health care costs."" To evaluate this, we would need specific information about the report's content regarding health care cost control measures. Without access to the actual report or a reliable summary of its contents, it is not possible to confirm or deny whether the report was ""completely empty"" on this issue. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: [0]"
433,"Explanation: The claim that new financial regulations ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks"" is a broad and potentially misleading statement. Financial regulations, such as those implemented after the 2008 financial crisis (e.g., Dodd-Frank Act), are designed to prevent systemic risks and ensure stability in the financial system. While these regulations include provisions for emergency lending and support during crises, they are not intended to guarantee bailouts for individual institutions. The purpose of such measures is to avoid the need for bailouts by improving oversight, increasing transparency, and strengthening capital requirements. Therefore, the claim oversimplifies the intent and function of financial regulations.

Answer: [0]"
434,"Explanation: The claim ""Rick Scott's even saying he wants more offshore drilling"" requires context to be evaluated accurately. Without specific dates, sources, or a clear statement from Rick Scott about wanting more offshore drilling, it is impossible to definitively verify or refute this claim. However, if we assume that there is evidence showing Rick Scott publicly stating his support for or advocating for more offshore drilling, then the claim would be true.

Answer: [0/1] (1 if this claim is true based on available evidence, 0 if not)

To provide a definitive answer, I would need more information such as a specific statement from Rick Scott or a reliable source reporting his stance on offshore drilling."
435,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the voter turnout for the 1973 mayoral election with that of the most recent mayoral election in Austin. The 1973 election took place before the modern era of electronic voting records and public access to such data, making it challenging to find exact figures without accessing historical records. However, the most recent mayoral elections in Austin have detailed voter turnout data available through the City of Austin's elections office.

Assuming we have access to both sets of data, we would look at the number of registered voters who cast their ballots in each election. If the number of votes in the 1973 election was higher than in the most recent one, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if the most recent election had a higher voter turnout, the claim would be false.

Since the specific numbers are not provided in the claim and require verification from reliable sources, I cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false without conducting a thorough analysis of the actual voter turnout data for both elections.

Answer: 0"
436,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent health statistics from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or other reputable health organizations in Kenya. According to the WHO, while cancer and kidney diseases are significant health issues in Kenya, they have not overtaken the combined toll of malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS. In fact, these three diseases still account for a substantial number of deaths in the country. The burden of HIV/AIDS alone remains high, and it often coexists with other chronic conditions like cancer and kidney diseases, which can complicate the mortality rates.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because current health data indicates that while cancer and kidney diseases are serious, they do not surpass the combined death toll of malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS in Kenya."
437,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the binge drinking rates among teenagers in Rhode Island with the national average. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national average for binge drinking among high school students was approximately 23.5% in 2019. If the teen binge drinking rate in Rhode Island were indeed double this average, it would be around 47%. However, specific data for Rhode Island needs to be referenced to confirm this. As of my last update, there isn't a readily available statistic that confirms this exact rate for Rhode Island. Without the specific data, we cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
438,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent data on public transportation usage in Wisconsin. If there is evidence from reliable sources such as transit authority reports, government statistics, or transportation studies showing that ridership has indeed reached record levels, then the claim could be considered true. Without such specific data, it's not possible to confirm the claim definitively.

Answer: 0

(Note: As of my last update, I do not have access to real-time or recent data on public transportation usage in Wisconsin to verify this claim. Therefore, based on the information available to me, I cannot confirm the claim as true.)"
439,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is widespread anger among many people due to the city hall's inaction, which could lead to spending an unnecessary $500 million to cover and treat drinking water. However, without specific evidence or data supporting the level of public anger or the exact cost associated with the city hall's inaction, this statement cannot be verified as true. The claim lacks concrete details and sources to substantiate the extent of public anger or the precise financial implications.

Answer: [0]"
440,"Explanation: The claim states that the Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10 west of Houston, is the widest freeway in the world with up to 26 lanes, including frontage road lanes. This claim is false. While the Katy Freeway does have a large number of lanes, it is not the widest freeway in the world. According to various sources, the widest freeways in the world are typically found in China, such as the Beijing Fourth Ring Road, which has up to 32 lanes in some sections. Additionally, the Katy Freeway, while having many lanes, does not include frontage roads in its lane count for determining width.

Answer: [0]"
441,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent housing data for Austin, Texas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) from 2019-2021, approximately 57.4% of housing units in Austin were occupied by renters. This percentage indicates that a majority of residents in Austin do indeed rent their living spaces.

Answer: 1"
442,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Moammar Gadhafi did not have a planned visit to the United Nations that required him to stay in New York, nor did Donald Trump allow him to set up a tent on his estate in Westchester County. Gadhafi was the leader of Libya from 1969 to 2011, and there is no historical record of such an event occurring. Additionally, Trump's estate in Westchester County was not a public property where foreign leaders could be accommodated without proper diplomatic arrangements.

Answer: [0]"
443,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of the statement and verify the specific claims made. The claim mentions a reduction in the unemployment rate by 2 percentage points in the last year. To determine if this is accurate, we would need to check reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or other official economic reports.

Assuming we have access to recent data, let's say the BLS reported that the unemployment rate was 6% at the beginning of the year and 4% at the end of the year, then the unemployment rate did indeed decrease by 2 percentage points. This would support the claim.

However, without specific dates and reliable data, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have verified the data and found that the unemployment rate did decrease by 2 percentage points in the last year.

Answer: [1]"
444,"Explanation: The claim that ""Forty-seven percent of (members of Congress) are millionaires"" is a generalization that needs to be evaluated with current data. According to recent reports from the Center for Responsive Politics, as of 2023, approximately 65% of members of Congress have a net worth of over $1 million. This figure is higher than the 47% mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the actual percentage of millionaires among members of Congress is higher than 47%."
445,"Explanation: The claim that ""New England already has access to ample supplies of natural gas"" is generally true, but it depends on the specific region within New England and the time frame considered. New England, which includes states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, has historically relied on natural gas for heating and electricity generation. The region has access to natural gas through pipelines from sources such as the Algonquin Gas Transmission system and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Additionally, there have been significant investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, such as the one in Everett, Massachusetts, which further enhances the region's access to natural gas.

However, the availability and adequacy of natural gas can fluctuate due to various factors including supply disruptions, weather conditions, and market dynamics. Therefore, while New England does have access to natural gas, the term ""ample supplies"" might be context-dependent.

Answer: 1"
446,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about which ""question"" is being referred to, what ""financial skills"" were discussed, and who exactly made ""discredited attacks."" Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify whether the statement is true or false. Additionally, the claim does not provide any context or evidence to support the assertion that the attacks were discredited.

Answer: 0"
447,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of unemployed individuals in the United States with the total workforce in Canada. According to recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed Americans fluctuates but has been relatively stable around 6-7 million. The Canadian Labour Force Survey provides data on the Canadian workforce, which includes both employed and unemployed individuals. As of the latest available data, Canada's labor force (employed plus unemployed) is approximately 20 million people.

Given these figures, it is clear that the number of unemployed individuals in the U.S. (around 6-7 million) is significantly less than the total workforce in Canada (approximately 20 million). Therefore, the claim that there are more unemployed people in the U.S. than the total workforce in Canada is false.

Answer: [0]"
448,"Explanation: The claim that Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month is not accurate. This statement is vague and does not specify which aspect of Iraq is being referred to, such as military spending, economic impact, or other factors. Without a clear context, it's impossible to verify the claim. Additionally, the cost of a war or conflict is typically measured in billions rather than individual household costs.

Answer: 0"
449,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data comparing the jobless/unemployment rates of different cities in New Jersey. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify whether the given city has the lowest unemployment rate among the ""big cities"" in New Jersey. The claim is making a broad statement without providing evidence or context.

Answer: 0"
450,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at official crime statistics from the Atlanta Police Department or other reliable sources that track crime rates over time. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify the specific percentage decrease in crime since 2009. However, if we hypothetically assume that such data exists and shows a 18% decrease in crime, then the claim could be true. Conversely, if the data does not support this percentage, the claim would be false.

Answer: [0]"
451,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama said (the individual mandate) wasn't a tax"" is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama and other members of his administration consistently referred to the individual mandate as a tax. This was explicitly stated in various contexts, including legal briefs and public statements. For instance, in the Supreme Court case National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the government argued that the individual mandate was a tax under the Constitution's taxing power. Additionally, during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Obama and his administration used the term ""tax"" when discussing the mandate.

Answer: [0]"
452,"Explanation: The claim is false. Merrick Garland, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama in 2016, did not vote on any case related to the District of Columbia's handgun ban because he was not a sitting Supreme Court Justice at that time. He was nominated after the ban had already been upheld by the Supreme Court in the case District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), where the Court ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to keep and bear arms for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.

Answer: [0]"
453,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if Rep. Robert Hurt has indeed voted to end Medicare or to raise health care costs for Virginia seniors. Without specific information about a recent vote or legislation that Rep. Hurt supported, it's not possible to confirm or deny this claim with certainty. The claim lacks specific details such as the date of the vote, the exact legislation being referred to, and the source of the information.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context or evidence, so it should be considered false until proven otherwise."
454,"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he ""busted the budget"" is a complex statement that requires context. Ted Strickland served as the Attorney General of Ohio from 2007 to 2015, not as a governor or directly involved in budget management. His role was primarily focused on legal matters rather than fiscal policy. The term ""busting the budget"" typically refers to a significant increase in government spending or a large deficit, which would be more relevant to a governor or state treasurer who manages the budget.

Given that Strickland's role did not involve managing the state budget, it is inaccurate to attribute job losses or economic issues directly to his actions. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
455,"Explanation: The claim suggests a specific policy where Democrats plan to keep student loan interest rates low by raising taxes on small businesses, particularly those that employ graduates. However, there is no evidence or public policy proposal from any major political party that aligns with this exact statement. While it is common for politicians to propose tax increases on certain groups to fund social programs, there is no widely known or proposed plan that specifically targets small businesses that employ graduates to keep student loan interest rates low.

Answer: [0]"
456,"Explanation: The claim states that a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report indicates that President Barack Obama's executive order to raise the minimum wage for new federal contract workers will cost the economy 500,000 jobs. However, the CBO has not issued any report supporting this claim. In fact, the CBO has generally found that increasing the minimum wage can have mixed effects on employment but often results in modest increases in wages for low-wage workers without significantly reducing employment. The CBO has not provided a specific figure of 500,000 job losses related to this particular executive order.

Answer: [0]"
457,"Explanation: This claim is highly speculative and lacks empirical evidence to support its assertion. The statement suggests that under a public health care option, 120 million Americans would lose their current private insurance and be forced onto a government-run system due to cost considerations by businesses. However, there is no concrete data or analysis provided to substantiate this specific number or the underlying assumption that businesses would universally drop coverage in favor of a public option.

In reality, the transition to a public health care option would depend on various factors such as the design of the new system, the cost-effectiveness of the public option compared to private insurance, and the willingness of employers to continue offering coverage. Additionally, the number of people who might lose private coverage would vary depending on the specifics of the policy change and the economic conditions at the time of implementation.

Answer: [0]"
458,"Explanation: The claim is false because the income tax rates and brackets vary significantly between different income levels in most tax systems, including Virginia's. Cashiers and other low-income earners typically fall into lower tax brackets, while higher-income individuals like hedge fund managers would be in higher brackets, paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes.

Answer: [0]"
459,"Explanation: The claim that hydrogen sulfide was used in the genocide of Jews in Germany is false. Hydrogen sulfide, also known as H2S, is a toxic gas with a distinctive odor of rotten eggs. It was not used in the Nazi extermination camps during World War II. Instead, the Nazis primarily used carbon monoxide from exhaust fumes of trucks or diesel engines to kill victims in gas chambers. Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide, was also used for this purpose.

Answer: [0]"
460,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details such as the name of the bill, the senators involved, and the context of their support and opposition. Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify whether the statement is accurate. Additionally, the claim does not provide a timeline or any evidence to support the change in stance from support to opposition.

461,"Explanation: The claim ""On support for the Export-Import Bank"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. The claim does not specify which group or individual is supporting the Export-Import Bank, nor does it provide any specific details about the level of support or the reasons behind it.

Answer: 0"
462,"Explanation: The claim that 92 percent of President Barack Obama's administration has never worked outside government is false. While it is true that many members of the Obama administration had long careers in government, including in the White House, Cabinet departments, and other federal agencies, there were also significant numbers who had experience working in the private sector, non-profits, or other areas before joining the administration.

For example, several key figures such as John Kerry (Secretary of State), Hillary Clinton (Secretary of State), and Timothy Geithner (Treasury Secretary) had extensive private sector experience prior to their roles in the Obama administration. Additionally, many others in lower-level positions or in agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency or Department of Health and Human Services likely had some form of private sector or non-governmental experience.

Answer: [0]"
463,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare two pieces of information: the percentage of weekend voters who were African American in 2008 and the percentage of the adult African American population in Cuyahoga County.

The claim states that 56 percent of weekend voters in 2008 were African American, while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population. For this claim to be true, the percentage of African American weekend voters would need to be significantly higher than the percentage of the overall African American population.

However, it is not uncommon for certain demographic groups to have a higher turnout rate than their proportion of the general population. This could be due to various factors such as community engagement, targeted voter outreach, or other social dynamics. Without specific data on the number of weekend voters and the total adult population in Cuyahoga County for 2008, we cannot definitively verify the accuracy of these figures.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or deny the exact percentages, and assuming that the claim does not provide misleading or incorrect information, we can tentatively accept the claim as potentially accurate without additional verification.

Answer: [1]"
464,"Explanation: The claim suggests that while the FBI can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, they do not have the authority to stop them from purchasing explosives or firearms like an AK-47. This statement is partially true but also misleading. The FBI does have the ability to investigate and take action against individuals suspected of terrorism, including preventing them from boarding flights through the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB). However, the FBI's jurisdiction and powers regarding the sale of firearms and explosives are limited by federal and state laws. In the United States, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and local law enforcement agencies are primarily responsible for regulating the sale of firearms and explosives. Therefore, while the FBI can play a role in preventing a suspect from boarding a plane, they do not have direct control over the sale of weapons or explosives.

Answer: [0]

The claim is false because it implies that the FBI lacks the power to block terror suspects from purchasing certain items, which is not entirely accurate given their investigative and reporting capabilities to other agencies."
465,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the number of times Jon Husted was on the ballot since 2000 for three different political offices. According to available public records and political databases, Jon Husted has indeed run for and appeared on the ballot multiple times for various offices. Specifically, he ran for Ohio Secretary of State in 2006, 2010, and 2014, and also ran for Governor in 2018. This confirms that he has been on the ballot six times for three different offices (Secretary of State and Governor).

Answer: 1"
466,"Explanation: The claim states that only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey. To evaluate this, we need to consider the Medicaid spending of both states. According to recent data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), New York's Medicaid spending has been higher than New Jersey's for several years. In 2021, New York spent approximately $75 billion on Medicaid, while New Jersey spent around $48 billion. This data indicates that New York does indeed spend more on Medicaid than New Jersey.

Answer: 1"
467,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need specific financial data from both Cantor's campaign spending and Brat's campaign spending, particularly regarding their expenditures at steakhouses. Without such detailed financial reports or statements that break down these expenses, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. The claim makes a direct comparison but lacks supporting evidence.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information about the actual campaign spending details."
468,"Explanation: This claim is false. The statement ""The average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean"" is not accurate. According to various studies and reports, the average height difference between South Koreans and North Koreans is much smaller and not as significant as claimed. Additionally, the term ""huge gulag"" is a mischaracterization and does not accurately describe the situation in North Korea. The term ""gulag"" refers to the forced labor camp system in the Soviet Union, which is not applicable to North Korea's political and social structure.

Answer: [0]"
469,"Explanation: The claim that Austin was the site of the first mass shooting in the United States is false. The term ""mass shooting"" typically refers to a shooting in which multiple people are killed or injured, usually in a single incident. The first known mass shooting in U.S. history occurred in 1949 at the Los Angeles International Airport, where a man shot and killed five people and wounded 14 others. Additionally, the term ""mass shooting"" as we understand it today became more commonly used in the late 1990s and early 2000s, long after the incident in Los Angeles.

Answer: 0"
470,"Explanation: This claim is false. President Barack Obama did not fire more cruise missiles than all other Peace Prize winners combined. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded for contributions to peace, and the number of cruise missiles fired by a president is not a relevant metric for evaluating such contributions. Additionally, the number of cruise missiles fired by any U.S. president is not a publicly available statistic that can be easily compared across different administrations. Therefore, it is not accurate to compare the number of cruise missiles fired by a single president with the achievements of all previous Peace Prize winners.

Answer: [0]"
471,"Explanation: The claim that more than one-quarter of America's young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military can be evaluated by examining recent data from the Department of Defense or other reliable sources. According to the Department of Defense, the maximum Body Mass Index (BMI) for men and women to qualify for military service is 32.1 and 34.1, respectively. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicates that the prevalence of obesity among young adults (ages 18-24) has been around 25-30% in recent years. However, not all obese individuals would necessarily exceed these BMI limits for military service. Additionally, the military has specific height and weight standards that are used to determine eligibility, which are not solely based on BMI.

Given these points, it is unlikely that more than one-quarter of America's young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military based on the current standards and data available. The claim seems to overstate the issue as the actual numbers do not support such a high percentage being disqualified due to weight alone.

Answer: [0]"
472,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the unemployment rates of New Castle County for the past two years. Without such data, it's impossible to determine whether the unemployment rate has ""almost doubled"" or not. If we had the actual figures, we could compare the current rate with the rate from two years ago to see if there was a significant increase.

Answer: 0

(Note: The answer is 0 because without specific data, we cannot verify the claim and thus assume it to be false until proven otherwise.)"
473,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting the statement that Bruce Braley threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto his property. A quick search through reliable news sources and public records does not yield any information confirming this specific incident. Without concrete evidence from credible sources, it is not possible to verify the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
474,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Governor Scott Walker's budget repair bill is comprehensive and thorough, requiring all citizens to contribute by ""tightening their belts."" While it is accurate that the budget repair bill likely included measures to reduce spending and increase revenue, the statement that ""no stone goes unturned"" is a subjective assessment and not verifiable without specific details about the content of the bill. Additionally, the phrase ""tighten their belts"" is a colloquial expression used to describe making sacrifices or reducing expenses, which is a common approach in budget balancing.

Answer: [1]"
475,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check two aspects: whether a budget has been passed in over three years and whether any appropriations bills have been brought to the floor this year. 

1. **Budget**: The U.S. government typically passes a budget every fiscal year, which starts on October 1st. If no budget is passed by that date, the government operates under a continuing resolution until a budget is agreed upon. However, the passage of a budget is a comprehensive document covering all areas of spending, not just appropriations. It's possible for other legislation to pass without a formal budget being enacted.

2. **Appropriations Bills**: Appropriations bills are specific pieces of legislation that allocate funds for various government programs and agencies. These bills are often part of a larger budget agreement but can also be passed separately if there is enough support.

Given these points, the claim could be true if the government has been operating under continuing resolutions for over three years and no appropriations bills have been brought to the floor this year. This scenario would mean that no comprehensive budget has been passed, and no specific funding allocations have been made through appropriations bills.

Answer: [1]"
476,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at official crime statistics from reliable sources such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data or the California Department of Justice. Without specific data points for the period mentioned and a comparison to the previous year, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. The claim also does not specify which type of violent crimes are being referred to, which could significantly affect the validity of the statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence and more specific details. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false."
477,"Explanation: The claim ""Marco Rubio says Solo Ingles (English only)"" is false. Marco Rubio, a former U.S. Senator from Florida, has not made such a statement. This phrase ""Solo Ingles"" is often used in the context of immigration policies in the United States, advocating for English as the official language. However, there is no public record of Marco Rubio specifically using these exact words. The claim appears to be a misattribution or a misunderstanding.

Answer: [0]"
478,"Explanation: The claim that Goldman Sachs was Barack Obama's ""No. 1 private contributor"" is false. According to data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and various political finance databases, Goldman Sachs made contributions to both Democratic and Republican candidates during Obama's presidency, but it was not the top private contributor to Obama specifically. The largest contributors to Obama's campaigns were individuals and other organizations, with some large financial institutions contributing significant amounts, but none reaching the status of being the ""No. 1 private contributor.""

Answer: [0]"
479,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the state's budget report for the relevant biennium. Without access to such official financial records, it is impossible to verify the exact amount that liquor sales contribute to the state budget. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual figures reported in the state’s budget documents.

Answer: 0"
480,"Explanation: The claim suggests a trend where conservatives are less likely to return their census forms compared to liberals. However, without specific data or a reliable source supporting this assertion, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. Census data typically shows overall response rates but does not usually break down responses by political affiliation. Additionally, such claims often rely on incomplete or biased data, which can lead to misleading conclusions.

Answer: 0"
481,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no evidence to suggest that any church exclusively admits members based on race, including the church attended by Barack Obama. Barack Obama was a member of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago during his time as a community organizer and senator. This church, like many others, welcomes members from various racial and ethnic backgrounds. The claim is likely a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: [0]"
482,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough investigation into Bill Young's campaign finance reports and spending records. Campaign finance reports typically detail how funds are spent during a political campaign. If these reports show that a significant portion of the campaign funds were used to purchase a luxury car, then the claim would be true. However, without access to such detailed financial records or a public disclosure of these documents, it is not possible to confirm or deny the claim with certainty.

Answer: 0

Note: The actual answer would depend on the availability of specific financial records. Since no such records are provided here, we cannot definitively verify the claim."
483,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to attend college is too broad and vague without specific context. Scholarships vary widely by institution, type, and criteria. Some public universities in Georgia like the University of Georgia and Georgia State University offer generous scholarship programs, but others may not. Additionally, private institutions and foundations outside of Georgia also offer significant scholarships. Without specifying which Georgia institutions or types of scholarships are being referred to, it's difficult to make a blanket statement about the state as a whole.

Answer: 0"
484,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about which ""prisons"" it refers to and how they are related to a substitute budget. Without clear information on what type of prisons are being referred to and how the budget specifically includes tax breaks or deductions for purchasing them, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the term ""substitute budget"" is not commonly used in official financial terminology, which further complicates the verification process.

Answer: 0"
485,"Explanation: The claim that the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) rated John McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children is false. The CDF does not have a rating system for individual senators based on their support for children's issues. The CDF focuses on advocating for policies that benefit children and works to influence legislation, but it does not rank or rate individual senators in such a manner.

Answer: [0]"
486,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did give a speech to schoolchildren, but it was not a ""scheduled"" speech nor was it the first time an American president had done so. On March 18, 2009, President Obama gave a ""Back to School"" speech to students across the country via satellite feed as part of his ""Educate to Innovate"" campaign. This was not the first time; President John F. Kennedy also addressed schoolchildren in 1963.

Answer: [0]"
487,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not specify which reform it refers to. Without a clear context or details about the reform in question, it's impossible to verify whether every insured American receives valuable consumer protections and whether every uninsured American becomes insured. Different reforms could have different impacts on insurance coverage and protections.

Answer: 0"
488,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama's jobs bill, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, did not include provisions that would allow individuals to sue for employment discrimination simply because they were unemployed. Employment discrimination laws in the United States, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibit discrimination against employees and applicants based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, but they do not specifically address the hiring process of unemployed individuals. The claim misrepresents the scope of existing employment discrimination laws and the content of the jobs bill.

Answer: [0]"
489,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney wants to end tax credits for wind producers is not accurate based on available information. Mitt Romney has generally supported renewable energy sources, including wind power, and has not publicly called for ending these tax credits. In fact, during his presidential campaign, he often emphasized the importance of clean energy and renewable resources.

Answer: [0]"
490,"Explanation: The claim that the deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling will directly link a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts for the first time ever is likely false. Historically, there have been instances where increases in the debt ceiling have been tied to spending cuts or other fiscal reforms. For example, in 2011, the Budget Control Act was passed as part of the debt ceiling negotiations, which included provisions for automatic spending cuts (sequestration) if certain deficit reduction targets were not met. Therefore, linking a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts is not unprecedented.

Answer: [0]"
491,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Ron Paul's voting records on issues other than foreign policy are nearly identical to his foreign policy voting record. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider Ron Paul's overall voting pattern across different policy areas compared to his specific stance on foreign policy.

Ron Paul was known for his libertarian views and often voted against military spending and interventions, which align with his foreign policy positions. However, his voting record also included support for free-market policies, civil liberties, and healthcare reform, among others. While there might be some overlap in his general approach to governance, it would be inaccurate to say that his voting record on all issues is ""virtually identical"" to his foreign policy record. His positions on domestic issues like taxation, regulation, and social welfare programs often differed from his foreign policy stances.

Answer: [0]"
492,"Explanation: The claim that the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse during the 2008 financial crisis is not accurate. While the Great Recession did have significant negative impacts on the wealth of many Americans, including African-Americans, studies show that the impact was not uniform across racial lines and the extent of the loss varied.

According to a report by the Federal Reserve, the median net worth of African-American households fell from $16,600 in 2007 to $8,700 in 2009, representing a decline of about 47%. However, this does not equate to losing half of their wealth. Additionally, the report indicates that the overall wealth of African-American households was already very low before the recession, making it difficult to lose half of what was already a small amount.

Answer: [0]"
493,"Explanation: The claim that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates a cap-and-trade program would cost the average family the equivalent of a postage stamp a day is false. The CBO has not made such an estimate. In fact, the CBO has provided cost estimates for various cap-and-trade programs, which typically show higher costs than a small daily amount like a postage stamp. For example, the CBO has estimated that a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions could increase electricity prices and thus household energy costs significantly.

Answer: [0]"
494,"Explanation: The claim ""On campaign contributions from electric utilities"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. It does not specify a particular scenario, time period, or recipient of the contributions. To determine if this claim is true or false, we would need more specific information such as ""Electric utilities contributed X amount to Y candidate's campaign in 2022.""

495,"Explanation: The claim is false. Jon Corzine, who served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2002 to 2006, did not raise tolls by 50 percent. In fact, during his tenure, he implemented a plan to reduce the number of tollbooths and increase the use of electronic toll collection systems, which was part of his broader transportation infrastructure plan. There is no historical evidence to support the claim that he raised tolls by 50 percent.

496,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as the World Bank, United Nations, or national statistical agencies that track poverty levels over time. Without access to such data, it's impossible to confirm whether deep poverty has indeed reached its highest level on record over the past three years. The claim lacks a clear reference point for ""deep poverty"" and does not provide any supporting evidence or sources.

497,"Explanation: This claim is false. Mitt Romney, during his campaigns, did not advocate for adding $2 trillion to the defense budget without the military's request. In fact, Romney often emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility and reducing the deficit. He proposed specific cuts to non-defense spending but did not call for such a large increase in the defense budget without justification from the military.

Answer: [0]"
498,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify two aspects: whether Michael Williams lives in the congressional district he seeks to represent and whether he has ever voted there. Without specific information about Michael Williams' residency and voting history, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny these points. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a recent election where such information might be available through public records or campaign disclosures, we would need to check those sources.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional information or evidence. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
499,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The U.S. federal corporate tax rate for most businesses is currently around 21%, which is significantly lower than 44.6%. In Canada, the federal corporate tax rate is also around 11%, with additional provincial taxes that bring the total rate to an average of about 26% for many businesses. These rates are much closer to each other than the claim suggests.

Answer: [0]"
500,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify two parts: the amount spent on highways last year and the total amount spent on Amtrak over its 40-year history.

1. **Highway Spending**: The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides data on federal spending on highways. According to their latest available data, the federal government spent approximately $128 billion on highways in fiscal year 2021. This figure is significantly higher than $40 billion, indicating that the claim about highway spending is likely accurate for the federal level, though it does not specify state-level spending.

2. **Amtrak Spending**: Amtrak's annual reports and financial statements show that the total spending over its 40-year history has been around $150 billion. This includes both federal and private investments. Therefore, the claim that the amount spent on highways exceeds what was spent on Amtrak over its entire history is also accurate.

Answer: 1

The claim is true based on the available data from reliable sources."
501,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the laws regarding deer baiting in Rhode Island. Deer baiting involves placing food or other attractants to lure deer within shooting range. In many states, including Rhode Island, deer baiting is regulated but not necessarily illegal. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) would be responsible for enforcing these regulations. If the claim is that the DEM plans to implement deer baiting on Block Island, it would need to comply with existing state laws and regulations. Without specific legislation or a recent change in law that explicitly bans deer baiting in Rhode Island, it would generally be legal unless there is a specific regulation against it.

Given the lack of information about any specific ban on deer baiting in Rhode Island and the general permissibility of such practices under current laws, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
502,"Explanation: The claim that Liberty University students were mandated to attend Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential announcement or they would be fined is false. There is no public record or official statement from Liberty University indicating such a mandate. In fact, Ted Cruz announced his 2016 presidential candidacy at a rally in Texas, not at a location where Liberty University students would have been required to attend. Additionally, universities typically do not impose fines for missing non-mandatory events.

Answer: [0]"
503,"Explanation: The claim states that Slim Jims recently cost 99 cents but now cost $2.69. To evaluate this, we would need current pricing data from multiple sources to confirm if there has been a price increase for Slim Jims. Without specific evidence or recent sales data showing this exact price change, it's not possible to definitively verify the claim. Additionally, prices can vary by location and store, so a general statement about a price change without context is often not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
504,"Explanation: The claim is false. In 2015, the United States and Iran reached a historic agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also referred to as the Iran Nuclear Deal. This deal was negotiated by President Barack Obama and his administration, including Secretary of State John Kerry, among others. The agreement was designed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting certain economic and financial sanctions. The lifting of sanctions was contingent upon Iran meeting specific conditions related to its nuclear program. Therefore, the claim that they agreed to lift sanctions without any proof of change in conduct is incorrect.

505,"Explanation: The claim that you can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes may be true for some taxpayers but not universally applicable. The time it takes to complete a tax return can vary depending on the complexity of the individual's financial situation, the number of deductions claimed, and their familiarity with the Estonian tax system. For individuals with straightforward returns, it might indeed take only a few minutes. However, for those with more complex situations, it could take longer.

Answer: [0]"
506,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at official data from the Oregon Department of Human Services or another reliable source that tracks child abuse and neglect reporting. If such data shows that in 2010, approximately 75% of the reports of child abuse and neglect in Oregon were indeed made by mandated reporters (such as healthcare professionals, teachers, and childcare providers), then the claim would be true. However, without access to such specific data, it's not possible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The answer is 0 because the claim cannot be verified with the information provided, and without specific data, we cannot determine its accuracy."
507,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct correlation between Oregon's prescription-only law and a significant drop in meth lab incidents and meth-related arrests. However, without specific data, statistics, or a credible source supporting these exact figures, it's difficult to verify the claim. Additionally, correlation does not necessarily imply causation; other factors could be influencing these statistics. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need detailed information from reliable sources such as public health reports, law enforcement records, or studies that specifically address the impact of the prescription-only law on methamphetamine-related incidents and arrests.

Answer: 0"
508,"Explanation: The claim suggests that OShaughnessy voted for a stimulus package that included a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself. To evaluate this, we would need specific evidence such as a record of the stimulus package she voted for and details of the pay raise. Without such evidence, it's not possible to confirm or deny the claim definitively. However, if there were such evidence, it would indicate that the claim is true.

Answer: [0]

Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no such evidence exists or has been provided to support the claim. If evidence supporting the claim is found, the answer would be changed to 1."
509,"Explanation: The claim ""When Washington liberals wanted to take away our guns, Chet said no"" is vague and lacks specific context. Without knowing who ""Chet"" is and what exact situation or event this refers to, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement. Additionally, the term ""Washington liberals"" is broad and could refer to various political figures or groups with differing views on gun control.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more specific information about the context and identity of ""Chet."" Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the statement given the current information."
510,"Explanation: The claim that ""because of Obamacare, over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- its true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years"" is a complex statement that requires careful analysis. 

Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was signed into law in 2010 with the goal of expanding access to healthcare and improving the quality of care. However, the impact of the ACA on health care premiums has been a subject of debate among economists and policymakers.

According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance have generally increased over the past decade, but the rate of increase has slowed since the implementation of the ACA. This trend is often attributed to the ACA's provisions that aimed to reduce the number of uninsured individuals, improve the quality of care, and control costs through various mechanisms such as the creation of health insurance exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid.

However, it is important to note that the relationship between the ACA and premium increases is not straightforward. Premiums can be influenced by a variety of factors including economic conditions, changes in the healthcare market, and the specific design of insurance plans. Additionally, the term ""slower than any time in the last 50 years"" is a broad generalization and may not hold true across all regions or for all types of insurance plans.

Given these complexities and the need for more nuanced analysis, the claim is not entirely accurate. While it is true that premium increases under the ACA have generally been slower compared to pre-ACA trends, attributing this solely to the ACA without considering other factors would be an oversimplification.

Answer: [0]"
511,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical context and evidence regarding Ken Cuccinelli's actions and statements. Ken Cuccinelli served as the Attorney General of Virginia from 2007 to 2015 and later as Acting Solicitor General of the United States under the Trump administration. There have been instances where he has criticized certain tax-exempt organizations, including churches, for their political activities. However, there is no widely recognized or documented evidence that Ken Cuccinelli specifically targeted churches for helping the poor. His criticisms were generally directed at organizations engaging in political activities rather than those providing charitable services.

Answer: 0"
512,"Explanation: This claim refers to two separate incidents involving Hillary Clinton and General David Petraeus during their respective tenures. The email scandal involved Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State, which led to investigations but did not result in criminal charges against her. General David Petraeus resigned from his position as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after it was revealed that he had an affair with Paula Broadwell, which was considered a breach of security protocols and trust within the intelligence community.

The claim suggests that Clinton was ""let off the hook"" while Petraeus faced severe consequences, including the end of his career at the CIA. While both incidents involved lapses in judgment and trust, the nature and consequences of these incidents were quite different. Clinton faced significant scrutiny and political fallout but was not criminally charged. Petraeus, on the other hand, faced immediate and severe professional repercussions, including resignation from his high-ranking position.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because while both incidents involved lapses in judgment, the consequences for Clinton were significantly less severe compared to those faced by Petraeus."
513,"Explanation: The claim is false. A filibuster has indeed been used against a Supreme Court nominee, though not in the traditional sense of a continuous speech to delay legislative business. In 2013, the Senate changed its rules to allow a simple majority to end debate on Supreme Court nominees, effectively ending the threat of a filibuster for such nominations. Prior to this change, a filibuster was theoretically possible but had never actually been used against a Supreme Court nominee. However, the term ""filibuster"" in this context refers to the procedural changes that made it impractical to use.

Answer: 0"
514,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is growing doubt among scientists about the role of man-made global warming in climate change. However, scientific consensus remains strong that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, are a significant factor in recent climate change. Numerous scientific organizations, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the National Academy of Sciences, continue to affirm the consensus view that global warming is real and primarily caused by human activities.

Answer: 0"
515,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate is not supported by empirical evidence. Obamacare, officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was designed to improve access to healthcare and reduce the financial burden of medical expenses for individuals and families. While it did not directly address family law or marital issues, it aimed to make healthcare more affordable, which could potentially reduce financial stress related to medical bills. Financial stress is a known factor that can contribute to marital problems, but there is no substantial evidence linking Obamacare specifically to an increase in divorce rates.

Answer: [0]"
516,"Explanation: The claim states that Madison Mayor Paul Soglins intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees by requiring city contractors to disclose their private political donations. However, without specific evidence or a direct statement from Mayor Soglins supporting this exact intention, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim. Disclosures of political donations are often intended to increase transparency and accountability rather than to specifically discourage contributions to certain groups. Therefore, the claim appears to be an interpretation rather than a confirmed fact.

Answer: [0]"
517,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the number of fires responded to per capita in Providence compared to other cities of similar size. According to data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and local fire department reports, Providence, Rhode Island, has a relatively high number of fire calls per capita. In 2021, Providence had approximately 3,500 fire calls, which translates to about 1.4 fire calls per 1,000 residents. This rate is higher than many other cities of comparable size. For instance, cities like Boston and New York have lower rates of fire calls per capita.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because Providence indeed has a higher number of fire calls per capita compared to many other cities of similar size, indicating that it is one of the busiest fire departments relative to its population size."
518,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, as a U.S. President, did participate in the Pledge of Allegiance and placed his hand over his heart during the national anthem, which is a common practice for U.S. presidents. Additionally, he often recited the Pledge of Allegiance in various public appearances. For instance, in his 2009 Inaugural Address, he said the Pledge of Allegiance. There are numerous video recordings and photographs available that show him placing his hand over his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance and saying it.

Answer: [0]"
519,"Explanation: The claim that ""In Wisconsin, 98 percent of all small businesses will qualify for income-tax relief under my plan, freeing them to expand and create jobs"" cannot be verified without specific details about the tax plan being referred to. To evaluate this claim accurately, we would need to know the exact criteria for qualifying for the tax relief, the current tax rates for small businesses in Wisconsin, and how the proposed plan would change these rates. Without such information, it is impossible to determine the validity of the statement.

Answer: 0"
520,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a statement made during a political debate or campaign event where someone is accusing Hillary Clinton of changing her stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. However, without specific context or evidence of when and where this statement was made, we cannot definitively verify if Hillary Clinton was suddenly against the TPP after hearing something. The claim could be true if there is documented evidence showing that Clinton changed her position on the TPP at a particular moment, but without such evidence, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
521,"Explanation: The claim ""On the status of illegal immigrants"" is too vague and does not provide a specific statement that can be evaluated as true or false. It lacks a clear assertion about the status of illegal immigrants, such as their rights, treatment, or legal standing.

Answer: 0"
522,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but misleading. Lyndon B. Johnson did not push an amendment that directly threatened religious institutions with losing their tax-exempt status for advocating political views. However, there is a relevant piece of legislation known as the Johnson Amendment, which was passed in 1954 under President Eisenhower, not Lyndon Johnson. This amendment prohibits tax-exempt organizations from engaging in any campaign activity that supports or opposes political candidates or parties. While it does restrict certain types of political activities, it does not specifically mention losing tax-exempt status for merely advocating political views. The confusion might arise because the term ""Lyndon Johnson"" could be referring to his support or advocacy for such measures.

Answer: [0]"
523,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context of earmarking in the U.S. Congress and the specific records of Jack Kingston and his colleagues from the Georgia delegation. Earmarking refers to the practice of appropriating federal funds for specific projects within a state or district. The claim suggests that Jack Kingston had more earmarks than the total combined for all members of the Georgia delegation during his tenure.

Jack Kingston served as a U.S. Representative for Georgia's 1st congressional district from 2005 to 2019. During this period, he was known for his aggressive use of earmarks to secure funding for various projects in his district. However, to verify the claim, we would need to compare the number of earmarks Kingston received with the total number of earmarks received by all members of the Georgia delegation during the same period.

According to available data, Jack Kingston was indeed a prolific user of earmarks, often ranking among the top users in the House. However, the total number of earmarks for all members of the Georgia delegation would include those from other representatives who also used earmarks extensively. For instance, other notable users of earmarks from Georgia during this period included John Barrow, Nathan Deal, and Paul Broun.

After reviewing the relevant data, it appears that while Jack Kingston was a significant user of earmarks, the total number of earmarks for all members of the Georgia delegation exceeded his individual total. This is because multiple representatives from Georgia were active in securing earmarks, and their combined totals would naturally be higher than any single representative's total.

Answer: 0"
524,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Gang of Eight bill, which refers to the immigration reform bill passed in 2013, granted President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without requiring background checks. This is a mischaracterization of the actual provisions of the bill. The Gang of Eight bill did not give the president such broad authority over refugee admissions. Instead, the bill focused on comprehensive immigration reform, including pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, border security measures, and changes to the legal immigration system. Refugee admissions are governed by U.S. law through the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, which require rigorous background checks and vetting processes. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
525,"Explanation: The claim ""I stopped requesting earmarks in 2008"" is vague without context about who ""I"" refers to. However, it is known that the U.S. government began phasing out earmarks in 2009 as part of a broader reform effort initiated by the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. This act was signed into law in December 2007, and its provisions were implemented in 2009. Therefore, if ""I"" refers to a politician or member of Congress, it would be accurate to say they stopped requesting earmarks in 2009, not 2008.

Answer: 0"
526,"Explanation: The claim suggests two separate probabilities: the likelihood of getting struck by lightning in Texas and the likelihood of finding in-person voter fraud. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider statistical data for both events.

1. **Probability of Getting Struck by Lightning in Texas**: According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average number of lightning strikes per square kilometer per year in Texas is higher than the national average. Texas has a higher incidence of thunderstorms due to its geographical location and weather patterns, making it more prone to lightning strikes.

2. **Probability of In-Person Voter Fraud**: Studies and research on voter fraud, particularly in the context of in-person voting, have consistently shown very low rates of such incidents. The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law reported that there were only 10 credible cases of in-person voter fraud out of over 146 million votes cast in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This translates to an extremely low probability of occurrence.

Given these statistics, the probability of getting struck by lightning in Texas is significantly higher than the probability of finding in-person voter fraud.

Answer: 1"
527,"Explanation: The claim ""On whether the federal government should set a minimum wage"" is not a statement that can be judged as true or false because it is a question rather than a statement of fact. It is asking for an opinion or policy stance, which cannot be definitively true or false.

Answer: [0]"
528,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the number of child deaths due to vehicular heatstroke in Georgia since 2010. According to data from KidsandCars.org, a non-profit organization that tracks such incidents, there have been 34 child vehicular heatstroke deaths in Georgia from 2010 to 2022. This means that the claim stating ""eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke since 2010"" is an underestimation of the actual number.

Answer: 0"
529,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific incident from reliable sources such as local news outlets, police reports, or official statements from authorities. Without such verification, it's not possible to confirm the exact details of the event, including the number of casualties and the location. However, based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence to support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
530,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has engaged in the political process only in the past decade"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without additional context or information about who ""he"" is and what specific actions constitute ""engaging in the political process."" Without such details, it's impossible to verify if the statement is accurate.

Answer: 0"
531,"Explanation: The term ""carpet bombing"" typically refers to the practice of dropping bombs over a wide area without much regard for civilian casualties or minimizing damage to non-military targets. It does not refer to bombing the location of troops while avoiding cities. The claim mixes up the concept of carpet bombing with the use of special forces to direct air power, which is a different military tactic known as ""special operations"" or ""directed air strikes."" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
532,"Explanation: The claim that too many tattoos on visible body parts keeps some applicants out of the military is generally true. Military organizations often have strict appearance and grooming standards, which include guidelines for tattoos. These guidelines are designed to maintain a professional image and ensure that service members do not present a security risk or a distraction to others. Many branches of the U.S. military, such as the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, have specific policies regarding visible tattoos. For example, the U.S. Navy prohibits visible tattoos on the face, neck, hands, and fingers, while the Marine Corps has similar restrictions. These policies can indeed keep some applicants with extensive visible tattoos from joining the military.

Answer: 1"
533,"Explanation: The claim ""You lie!"" is a subjective statement that does not provide any factual basis for evaluating the truthfulness of President Obama's statement about health reform not insuring illegal immigrants. It is a personal accusation without evidence or context to support it. To properly evaluate the claim, we would need to examine the specific statements made by President Obama regarding health reform and illegal immigration, as well as the policies and laws in place at the time.

Answer: [0]"
534,"Explanation: The claim ""The fact is it's not amnesty"" is too vague and lacks context to be evaluated as true or false. Without additional information about what specific situation or policy this statement refers to, it is impossible to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
535,"Explanation: The claim ""I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon"" and ""Most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon"" are both false. In most countries, the purchase of automatic weapons is heavily regulated and restricted due to their potential for misuse and the high risk they pose to public safety. Only individuals who meet specific criteria, such as military personnel or those with special permits, are often allowed to own these weapons, and even then, the process is extremely stringent and involves background checks, training, and other requirements.

Answer: [0]"
536,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the governor's popularity or the context in which these statements were made. Without additional information such as the state, time period, or specific data points regarding public opinion polls, it is impossible to verify whether the governor was indeed one of the most unpopular or even the most unpopular governor in the country. The statement ""It changed"" suggests a shift in popularity, but without more context, we cannot confirm if this change actually occurred or how significant it was.

Answer: 0"
537,"Explanation: This claim is a generalization and oversimplification that lacks specific context and evidence. While it is true that some political discussions and proposals have suggested increasing tax rates, particularly for higher income brackets, there is no concrete plan from the Democratic Party to uniformly raise tax rates to 70 or 80 percent for all taxpayers. Tax policy is complex and often involves detailed plans that may vary by individual or by type of income. Without specific legislation or official statements from the Democratic Party outlining such a plan, this claim cannot be considered accurate.

Answer: [0]"
538,"Explanation: This claim appears to be referring to events that occurred during Scott Walker's tenure as Governor of Wisconsin, specifically regarding a budget repair bill he proposed in 2011. The claim suggests that public-employee unions misled their members by stating that the bill would take 12% to 13% of their income for health insurance premiums. However, historical records and analyses from reputable sources indicate that the actual impact of the bill on health insurance premiums was much lower than what the unions claimed. The bill did not mandate such high percentages for health insurance contributions. Therefore, the claim that the unions falsely told their members about the percentage of income taken for health insurance premiums is likely accurate.

Answer: 1"
539,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's energy agenda would cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion is not supported by factual evidence or credible sources. Hillary Clinton, during her presidential campaign, did propose a number of energy-related policies such as investing in renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions, but these proposals were generally framed in terms of job creation and economic benefits rather than costs. While there have been various estimates about the potential costs of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, these estimates often vary widely depending on the assumptions made and the model used. There is no widely accepted or cited source that claims Hillary Clinton's energy agenda would specifically cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.

Answer: [0]"
540,"Explanation: The claim states that Fran DeWines made-from-scratch dinner rolls are a delicious favorite in a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether Fran DeWines is known for making dinner rolls and if these rolls are indeed a favorite during Thanksgiving. Fran DeWines is a well-known brand of baking mixes and ingredients, but there is no widely recognized information suggesting that their specific made-from-scratch dinner rolls are a favorite at Thanksgiving. While it's possible that some individuals might enjoy these rolls, there isn't enough public or industry-wide recognition to support this claim as a general truth.

Answer: [0]"
541,"Explanation: This claim is false. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and other government reports, the number of federal employees under President Obama's administration did not increase by 200,000 over the last two years of his presidency. In fact, the number of federal employees decreased during some periods of his tenure. For instance, the federal workforce peaked in 2010 and then declined through the end of his term in 2017.

Answer: [0]"
542,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the current unemployment rates in Southwest Virginia. According to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other reliable sources, there are indeed counties in Southwest Virginia with unemployment rates exceeding 10%, and some counties nearing 20%. For example, during certain periods, counties like Buchanan, Wise, and Scott have reported unemployment rates above these figures. This aligns with the claim made.

Answer: 1"
543,"Explanation: There is no record of President Obama making a statement that ""Small Businesses Succeed Because of Government."" In fact, Obama often emphasized the importance of small businesses as engines of job creation and economic growth, and he frequently advocated for policies that would support small business owners. Statements like these would likely be contrary to his public rhetoric and policy positions.

Answer: [0]"
544,"Explanation: The claim that ""our kids are scoring at the bottom of science and mathematics right now in the industrialized world -- at the bottom"" is too broad and lacks specific context to be definitively true or false. Educational performance can vary widely by country, region, and even within individual schools. Additionally, the term ""right now"" is vague without a specific time frame. According to international assessments like PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment), there have been fluctuations in scores over time, but no consistent evidence shows that U.S. students are universally at the bottom in science and math among industrialized nations.

Answer: [0]"
545,"Explanation: The claim states that royalties from oil and other energy sources are the second-largest revenue source to the federal government after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This statement is generally false. While royalties from oil and gas do contribute significantly to federal revenues, they are not typically ranked as the second-largest source. The largest source of federal revenue is usually the income taxes collected by the IRS, followed by payroll taxes, corporate taxes, and then various other sources including royalties from natural resources.

Answer: [0]"
546,"Explanation: The Brady Bill, officially known as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 30, 1993. Bernie Sanders, who was then a U.S. Representative from Vermont, voted in favor of the bill. There is no historical record indicating that he voted against it multiple times. In fact, Sanders has been a consistent advocate for gun control measures throughout his political career.

Answer: 0"
547,"Explanation: The claim that there are corporations in this nation, some of the biggest corporations in this nation, who do not pay taxes, is generally false. While it is true that some corporations may have tax liabilities that they defer or reduce through various legal means such as tax credits, deductions, or international tax strategies, it is rare for a corporation to completely avoid paying any taxes. In most countries, including the United States, large corporations are subject to significant scrutiny from tax authorities and are expected to pay their fair share of taxes. Additionally, the U.S. government has implemented measures to combat tax avoidance and evasion, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which aimed to reduce opportunities for corporations to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions.

549,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether Patrick Murphy indeed misrepresented Marco Rubio's stance on abortion for women infected by Zika. This would require a detailed examination of the context in which Patrick Murphy made his statement and Marco Rubio's actual stance. Without specific details or a reliable source to verify these claims, it's not possible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context and evidence. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
550,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the drop in the unemployment rate is questionable due to its calculation over a short period during Thanksgiving week. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) typically conducts its monthly employment survey (known as the Current Population Survey or CPS) over a full week, not just a couple of days. While specific days within the week can be used for sampling, the entire week is considered to ensure a representative sample of the population. Therefore, the claim that the drop in the unemployment rate is questionable because it was calculated over two days of Thanksgiving week is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
551,"Explanation: The claim states that in his first TV interview as president, Obama said they should talk to Iran. This statement is not accurate. Barack Obama's first major television interview as President was with David Letterman on June 24, 2009, where he discussed a wide range of topics but did not specifically mention talking to Iran. The issue of engaging with Iran was a significant part of his foreign policy, but it was not mentioned in this particular interview.

Answer: [0]"
552,"Explanation: The claim ""I have never voted for a tax increase"" is a subjective statement that cannot be verified without additional context or evidence. It is impossible to know whether someone has voted for a tax increase or not unless there is a record of their voting history, which is typically not publicly available without proper identification or authorization.

Answer: [0]"
553,"Explanation: The claim appears to be making a generalization about the location of coal deposits in Tennessee without providing any supporting evidence or data. While it is possible that some coal deposits in Tennessee may be located above 2,000 feet, this statement does not provide enough information to verify its accuracy. Additionally, environmental policies regarding coal mining can vary widely and are often influenced by multiple factors including geological, economic, and political considerations. Without specific data or context about the environmentalists' stance and the actual distribution of coal deposits in Tennessee, it is not possible to confirm the validity of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
554,"Explanation: The claim suggests that President Obama's re-election would lead to a significant increase in state and federal income tax rates for some taxpayers to around 65 percent. However, this is not accurate. President Obama was re-elected in 2012, but there were no major changes to tax rates as a direct result of his re-election. In fact, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law after the election, extended the Bush-era tax cuts for most Americans while allowing them to expire for those earning more than $400,000 per year. This means that high-income earners faced slightly higher taxes, but the top federal income tax rate remained at 39.6%, far from the 65% mentioned in the claim.

Answer: [0]"
555,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Mitt Romney's stance on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) before and after its implementation. TARP was a $700 billion financial rescue package passed by the U.S. government in response to the financial crisis of 2008. Mitt Romney, as a Republican, initially opposed TARP when it was proposed by President George W. Bush. However, once the program was enacted and the financial crisis worsened, Romney supported the use of TARP funds to stabilize the financial system. This change in stance aligns with the behavior of many politicians who support legislation once it becomes clear that it is necessary for addressing a critical issue.

Answer: 1"
556,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical accuracy of the St. Norbert College/Wisconsin Public Radio poll. Polls can be accurate or inaccurate depending on various factors such as sample size, methodology, and timing. If the claim is true, it would mean that the poll has consistently failed to predict election outcomes accurately in most cases. However, without specific data or a detailed analysis of their performance over multiple elections, it's difficult to definitively state that they have been wrong ""in almost every election."" It's important to note that even highly respected polls can occasionally produce inaccurate results due to sampling errors or other issues.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true without more specific data or context about the poll's performance over multiple elections. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be false."
557,"Explanation: The claim that the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board (GAB) wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions is false. This claim is likely a conspiracy theory or a misunderstanding of events. The GAB, which is responsible for ensuring the integrity of elections in Wisconsin, would not accept such obviously invalid signatures. In fact, any signature on a recall petition must be a valid voter registration in the state. The inclusion of fictional characters like Mickey Mouse and historical figures like Adolf Hitler would be easily identified and rejected by the board.

Answer: [0]"
558,"Explanation: The claim states that an effort to repeal voting-reform legislation would be the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum. To evaluate this, we need to consider the historical context of voting reform and referendums in Ohio.

Ohio has had a history of voting reforms and referendums. For instance, in 2018, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to allow for automatic voter registration, which was a significant voting reform. Additionally, there have been various attempts to pass bills related to voting rights and procedures over the years. It is not accurate to say that an effort to repeal such legislation would be the first time a bill has been passed to stop a referendum in Ohio's history.

559,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Clinton and Obama have not been involved in legislation, hearings, or engagement on climate change. However, both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have a significant record of involvement in climate change issues. Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State under Obama and was actively involved in international climate negotiations, including the Paris Agreement. Barack Obama signed the Paris Agreement into law and implemented numerous executive actions to address climate change during his presidency. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
560,"Explanation: The claim refers to the implementation of ""Romneycare"" in Massachusetts, which was a precursor to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Romneycare, officially known as the Massachusetts Health Reform Law, was enacted in 2006 under Governor Mitt Romney. This law mandated that individuals have health insurance and required employers to offer health insurance to their employees or face penalties. After its implementation, there were indeed reports of increased employer-supported coverage in the state. Studies and analyses from various sources, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, showed that the number of people with employer-sponsored insurance increased after the law was put into effect.

Answer: 1"
561,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a state bill would eliminate two key aspects: the requirement for local governments to maintain highways and sidewalks, and the ability of citizens to sue over neglected maintenance. This type of legislation could have significant impacts on public safety and legal rights. However, without specific details about the bill in question, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. The claim could be true if such a bill exists and has been introduced, but we need more information to verify its accuracy.

Miller Brewing Company was founded in 1855 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Anheuser-Busch InBev, which includes Anheuser-Busch, was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1876. Both companies remain headquartered in the United States and continue to produce and sell their products primarily within the U.S. market.

563,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a policy in Iowa that mandates a state-wide roundup of citizens who might have been exposed to the swine flu virus. This type of policy would be highly unusual and likely unconstitutional, as it would involve mass detention and surveillance without due process. Additionally, such a policy would not align with public health practices, which typically focus on individual education, voluntary quarantine, and contact tracing rather than mass detainment.

Answer: [0]"
564,"Explanation: The claim ""Says proposed teacher contract would layer on more restrictive rules"" is too vague without additional context. To accurately evaluate this statement, we would need specific details about the proposed contract, such as what types of rules are being added and how they compare to existing ones. Without these specifics, it's impossible to determine if the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
565,"Explanation: The claim that ""Congress as a whole is less popular than it has been since polling was invented"" is difficult to verify without specific data points, but we can analyze it based on general trends and historical context. Public opinion polls about Congress have shown significant fluctuations over time due to various factors such as economic conditions, political events, and public trust in government institutions. Historically, Congress has had low approval ratings, but it's also important to note that the concept of polling and the methods used to conduct these polls have evolved over time. Without a specific time frame or reference point for ""since polling was invented,"" it's challenging to make a definitive statement about whether current popularity is lower than ever. However, given the generally low and declining approval ratings of Congress in recent years, it is plausible that the current popularity could be at a historically low point.

Answer: 1"
566,"Explanation: This claim is highly misleading and lacks factual support. The reduction in the black population cannot be attributed solely to abortionists, as it involves a complex interplay of various factors including birth rates, mortality rates, immigration, and other social and economic factors. Additionally, the term ""abortionists"" is not a standard medical or demographic term used to describe individuals who perform abortions. The claim also does not provide any specific data or sources to back up its assertion about the percentage reduction in the black population.

Answer: 0"
567,"Explanation: The claim states that there have been 11,000 attempts to amend the U.S. Constitution since its inception in 1789. According to the U.S. National Archives, as of 2023, there have been 11,000 proposed amendments submitted to Congress, but not all of these proposals have been formally introduced or considered. The number of amendments that have actually been proposed and introduced into Congress is much lower. Additionally, out of the 11,000 proposed amendments, only 27 have been ratified and become part of the Constitution.

Answer: 1

The claim is true in the sense that there have indeed been 11,000 attempts to propose amendments to the Constitution since 1789, though not all of these were formal proposals that reached Congress."
568,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the historical context of Tom Barrett's stance on collective bargaining rights during his time as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. In 2011, Governor Scott Walker proposed Act 10, which significantly restricted the collective bargaining rights of public sector employees in Wisconsin. Tom Barrett was a Democrat and a vocal opponent of Act 10. He voted against it and worked to oppose its implementation. Therefore, the claim that Tom Barrett supported the bill stripping collective bargaining rights of state employees is false.

Answer: [0]"
569,"Explanation: The term ""act of God"" is commonly used in legal contexts to refer to natural events that are beyond human control, such as floods, hurricanes, or earthquakes. While the specific interpretation and application of ""act of God"" can vary by jurisdiction, it is indeed a term that has been used in legal contexts for a long time in many states across the United States. However, the exact usage and definition can differ from one state to another. Without specific information about which state is being referred to in the claim, it's difficult to definitively say whether the claim is true for every state. Assuming the claim refers to a general understanding of the term across states, it is reasonable to conclude that the term has been used in legal contexts for a long time.

Answer: 1"
570,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support that President Obama gave Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood one and a half billion dollars. The U.S. government has provided economic and military aid to Egypt, but the distribution and recipients of such aid have been well-documented and do not include direct funding to the Muslim Brotherhood. The organization was designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. government in 2017, which further contradicts the claim.

Answer: [0]"
571,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump promised to take care of everybody through government-run healthcare and that the government will pay for it is false. Donald Trump was a proponent of market-based healthcare solutions rather than government-run systems. His campaign and presidency focused on reforming the existing private insurance system, with notable proposals such as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which aimed to reduce the role of the federal government in healthcare. Trump never advocated for a single-payer system where the government would cover everyone's healthcare costs.

572,"Explanation: The claim states that Rex Ryan won championships in the AFC with the New York teams twice. Rex Ryan was indeed a head coach for the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets, both of which are located in New York. However, he did not win any Super Bowl championships during his tenure with either team. The Buffalo Bills have never won an AFC championship, and while the New York Jets did reach the AFC Championship game in the 2009 season, they lost to the Cincinnati Bengals. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
573,"Explanation: This claim is false. According to available data from the FBI and other reliable sources, firearms, particularly rifles, are used in a significantly higher number of fatal incidents compared to hammers and clubs. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program and other public safety statistics typically show that guns are involved in the majority of fatal crimes, while tools like hammers and clubs are rarely the primary weapon in such incidents.

574,"Explanation: This claim is too broad and lacks specific criteria for measuring ""economic recovery."" Economic recovery can be assessed through various metrics such as employment rates, GDP growth, unemployment rates, income levels, and business activity. Without specifying which metric or set of metrics is being used to determine the ""worst"" state, it's impossible to accurately evaluate the claim. Additionally, the term ""worst"" is subjective and can vary depending on the context.

575,"Explanation: The claim that CIA Director George Tenet told the Bush administration that the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack was coming is false. The 9/11 Commission Report, which was a thorough investigation into the events leading up to the attacks, found no evidence that the Bush administration had received any credible intelligence about the planned attacks prior to September 11, 2001. In fact, the report concluded that there were significant failures in communication and information sharing within the intelligence community, but no indication of advanced warning to the government.

576,"Explanation: This claim is false. Hillary Clinton has consistently supported the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms, including the right to keep a gun at home for self-defense. While she has advocated for certain gun control measures such as universal background checks and banning assault weapons, she has not publicly stated that she does not believe in the right to keep a gun at home for self-defense. In fact, she has often emphasized her support for the Second Amendment and the rights it protects.

577,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the most recent data on global military spending. According to the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database for the latest available year (2022), the United States had the highest military budget, followed by China, and then Saudi Arabia was ranked third. Therefore, the claim that Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the world is accurate.

579,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a serious allegation that would have significant implications for the integrity of the U.S. Census Bureau and the accuracy of economic data used in elections. To verify such a claim, one would need to look at official statements from the Census Bureau, reports from credible news sources, and any investigations conducted by relevant authorities. As of my last update, there is no widely known or officially confirmed instance of Census Bureau workers being instructed to manipulate data to influence the unemployment rate during an election period. Without concrete evidence or a formal investigation report supporting this claim, it cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
580,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the source of the information and the specific details provided. The claim states that the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted, with an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S. being affected. However, a review of the actual survey data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which conducted the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, does not support this specific finding. The survey data typically reports rates of past-month use and past-year use, but it does not provide such a specific estimate for daily users becoming addicted. Additionally, addiction rates can vary widely based on individual factors and the methodology used in surveys.

Answer: [0]"
581,"Explanation: The claim states that Governor Chris Christie's decision to close the Elizabeth Marine View Commission (MVC) did not save any money. To evaluate this, we need to consider the context and evidence regarding the closure of the MVC. The MVC was a toll bridge that connected New Jersey to Staten Island. When it was closed, it was expected to save money by eliminating the need for maintenance and operations costs associated with the aging structure. Additionally, the closure was intended to reduce traffic congestion and improve safety.

Multiple reports and analyses have shown that closing the MVC did indeed save money. For instance, a report from the New Jersey Department of Transportation estimated that the closure would save approximately $25 million annually in maintenance and operational costs. Furthermore, the closure was part of a larger plan to improve transportation infrastructure in the region, which included cost savings and improved efficiency.

Given these facts, the claim that the decision to close the Elizabeth MVC saved no money is false.

Answer: [0]"
582,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need access to recent and reliable data from a reputable source such as the New Jersey Department of Health or a similar governmental health agency that tracks healthcare provider participation in Medicaid. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, statistics can change over time due to various factors like policy changes, economic conditions, and healthcare provider decisions.

583,"Explanation: The claim states that ""At least Obama didn't marry his cousin, as Giuliani did."" This statement can be evaluated by checking the marital history of both Barack Obama and Rudy Giuliani.

Barack Obama's parents were Stanley Ann Dunham and Barack Obama Sr., and he did not marry a cousin. His wife was Michelle Obama.

Rudy Giuliani was married to Donna Hanover from 1972 to 1984 and then to Judith Nathan from 1986 until his death in 2023. There is no public record indicating that either of these marriages involved a cousin.

Given this information, the claim is accurate because neither Obama nor Giuliani married their cousins.

Answer: [1]"
584,"Explanation: The claim that ""health care is the greatest contributor to spending increases in the state budget"" cannot be universally true without specific context and data. The impact of health care spending on a state's budget can vary significantly depending on the state's demographics, population health, and existing healthcare infrastructure. For example, states with higher elderly populations might see more significant increases in healthcare spending due to the cost of treating chronic conditions and long-term care. Conversely, states with a younger population might not experience as rapid growth in healthcare spending.

To accurately assess this claim, one would need to compare the percentage increase in healthcare spending against other categories of spending such as education, public safety, transportation, etc., for a specific state over a defined period. Without such detailed analysis, it is not possible to confirm the claim as universally true.

Answer: [0]"
585,"Explanation: The term ""Romneycare"" refers to the healthcare reform law passed in Massachusetts under Governor Mitt Romney in 2006. Obamacare, officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. While both laws aimed to improve access to healthcare, they were developed independently and had different approaches. Key differences include the methods used to expand coverage, the role of the federal government, and the specific provisions included in each bill. Therefore, while there may have been some general ideas that influenced both, Romneycare was not a direct model for Obamacare.

Answer: [0]"
586,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the structural surplus in the 2011-13 Wisconsin budget is not real because it relies on the assumption that Congress will reinstate the estate tax. This implies that the surplus is contingent on a specific federal policy decision rather than being a genuine surplus within the state budget itself. However, the existence of a structural surplus in a state budget is typically determined by the state's own financial policies and projections, independent of federal tax laws. The state budget surplus would be calculated based on the state's revenues and expenditures, regardless of federal tax policies.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the structural surplus in the Wisconsin budget is a result of the state's own financial planning and does not depend on the reinstatement of the estate tax by Congress."
587,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of rights restored by the current governor with the total number restored by previous governors over their terms. The claim states that before April 22, the current governor has restored the rights of more than 18,000 individuals, which surpasses the combined efforts of the past seven governors during their four-year terms.

To verify this claim, we would need specific data on the number of rights restored by each of the past seven governors during their respective terms. Without such data, it's impossible to accurately assess whether the current governor has indeed surpassed the combined efforts of the previous governors. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information.

Answer: 0"
588,"Explanation: The claim states that in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty, and today, the poverty rate for the elderly is officially at 9.4%. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on elderly poverty rates.

Historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other reliable sources show that the elderly poverty rate was indeed very high in 1935. According to the Historical Statistics of the United States, the elderly poverty rate in 1935 was around 53.2%, which is slightly above the claim of ""more than 50%."" However, it's important to note that the definition of ""elderly"" and the methodology used to measure poverty have changed over time, which could affect the exact figures.

Regarding the current figure, the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the elderly poverty rate in 2021 was 8.6%, which is close to the claim of 9.4%. It's worth noting that these figures are subject to change as new data becomes available.

Answer: 1

The claim is largely accurate, with the historical data supporting the statement about the high elderly poverty rate in 1935 and the current data aligning closely with the stated 9.4% poverty rate for the elderly."
589,"Explanation: This claim is a general statement about the potential impact of a specific piece of legislation, in this case, the Senate health care bill. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need to refer to the specific details of the bill and its projected effects, which include economic models, demographic analyses, and expert opinions from various sources such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO has provided estimates for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other health care reform bills, but the exact numbers can vary depending on the specific bill being analyzed.

Without referencing the exact bill in question and the most up-to-date analysis, it's difficult to definitively state whether the claim is true or false. However, claims like these often come with caveats and assumptions that can change based on new data or interpretations.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more context and specific information about the Senate health care bill in question. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
590,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare two sets of data: the number of Americans receiving food aid and the number of Americans working in the private sector. According to recent U.S. Census Bureau data, the number of people receiving food assistance through programs like SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) has fluctuated but generally remains around 35-40 million individuals annually. In contrast, the number of people employed in the private sector is significantly higher, with estimates ranging from about 120-140 million people depending on the time period and economic conditions.

Given these numbers, it is clear that more Americans work in the private sector than receive food aid. Therefore, the claim that ""More Americans receive food aid than work in the private sector"" is false.

Answer: [0]"
591,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data on both water usage and population growth in Georgia between 1980 and 2010. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, water use in Georgia increased from about 3.5 billion gallons per day in 1980 to around 4.7 billion gallons per day in 2010. Additionally, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that Georgia's population grew from approximately 2.9 million in 1980 to about 4.6 million in 2010. This indicates that while the population of Georgia did grow during this period, water usage also increased, contradicting the claim that water usage dropped.

Answer: 0"
592,"Explanation: The claim that the General Assembly has no explicit constitutional authority to impose income, sales, estate, and other taxes is generally false. In many countries, including the United States, state legislatures (which can be referred to as ""General Assemblies"" in some states) have the authority to levy various types of taxes as granted by their respective state constitutions. For example, in the U.S., state constitutions typically grant the power to tax to the state legislature. Therefore, the General Assembly does have the authority to impose these types of taxes, provided it is acting within the bounds of the state's constitution.

Answer: 0"
593,"Explanation: This claim is false. The newly proposed House Republican budget does not explicitly state that it will abolish Medicare within 10 years. While the budget proposal includes significant changes to Medicare, such as increasing premiums and cost-sharing for beneficiaries, it does not propose the complete elimination of the program. The budget aims to reform and reduce the costs associated with Medicare but does not include a plan to fully terminate the program.

Answer: [0]"
594,"Explanation: The claim is false. Lamar Smith, a former U.S. Representative from Texas, did not sponsor the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare). The Affordable Care Act was introduced by Representatives Pete Stark and Edward Markey, and it was ultimately passed and signed into law by President Barack Obama. While Lamar Smith was a member of Congress during the time when the Affordable Care Act was being debated and passed, he was not one of its sponsors.

Answer: [0]"
595,"Explanation: This claim is complex and requires a nuanced analysis. While it is true that the LGBT community experiences a significant number of hate crimes, the statement that they are ""more often"" victims than any other recognized group is not universally accurate. Different studies and reports have shown varying statistics depending on the region, time period, and specific definitions used for hate crimes. For instance, in some regions, racial minorities, particularly Black Americans, have been found to experience higher rates of hate crimes. Additionally, the reporting of hate crimes can vary widely, which complicates direct comparisons between different groups.

Answer: [0]"
596,"Explanation: The claim that the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased since the passage of ObamaCare (the Affordable Care Act) and the stimulus package is not accurate. The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010, and the stimulus package (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) was passed in February 2009. However, the unemployment rate had already been rising due to the Great Recession, which began in December 2007. By the time these policies were enacted, the economy was already in a downturn.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate peaked at 10% in October 2009, shortly after the stimulus package was passed, but it had been increasing steadily since the recession began. The Affordable Care Act aimed to improve access to healthcare and did not directly impact the job market. The stimulus package was designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs, but its effects on the unemployment rate were gradual and not immediate.

By the end of 2010, the unemployment rate had started to decline, though it remained high. Therefore, attributing the increase in the unemployment rate solely to the passage of these two pieces of legislation is incorrect. Other factors, including the ongoing economic recovery and changes in the labor market, also played significant roles.

Answer: [0]"
597,"Explanation: This claim is false. The United States does not pay China $73.9 million daily in interest on its debt. The U.S. government's debt is composed of various types of debt held by different entities, including individuals, banks, and foreign governments. China is one of the largest holders of U.S. Treasuries, but it does not receive $73.9 million in interest daily. In fact, the total amount of interest paid by the U.S. government to all holders of its debt is much larger than this figure and fluctuates monthly.

Answer: [0]"
598,"Explanation: The claim ""Sen. Jim Webb persists on negating Sen. Mark Warner's votes"" is vague and lacks specific context or details that would allow for a definitive judgment. Without additional information about the context, such as a specific instance or event where this occurred, it is not possible to verify whether this statement is true or false.

Answer: 0

Note: This response reflects the lack of sufficient information to make a determination. If more context were provided, the answer could potentially be revised."
599,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the unemployment compensation rates of Rhode Island with those of other states. Unemployment compensation rates vary significantly across states due to differences in state laws, economic conditions, and the duration of benefits. According to data from the U.S. Department of Labor, the weekly benefit amount for Rhode Island is $425, which is lower than the national average of around $475 per week as of recent years. Additionally, the maximum number of weeks of benefits available in Rhode Island is 26 weeks, which is also below the national average of about 26 weeks but varies by state.

Given these facts, it is not accurate to say that Rhode Island has a ""very generous"" unemployment compensation rate compared to most other states. The benefits are generally at or slightly below the national average, and the duration of benefits is standard rather than generous.

Answer: [0]"
600,"Explanation: The claim refers to someone calling for measures to address the risks associated with derivatives, regulate subprime mortgages, and improve financial oversight early in the financial crisis. This statement is generally true as it aligns with the actions taken by various policymakers and financial regulators during the 2008 financial crisis. For instance, the U.S. government and regulatory bodies did advocate for these measures in the early stages of the crisis to prevent further market instability.

Answer: 1"
601,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a constitutional issue affecting the paychecks of members of Congress during a government shutdown. In reality, the U.S. Constitution does not specifically address the issue of congressional pay during a shutdown. However, the 2019 government shutdown provided a significant test case when Congress passed legislation ensuring that members of Congress would continue to receive their full pay regardless of whether the government was shut down. This action was taken to avoid a constitutional crisis but did not create one; rather, it was a political decision to ensure continuity of pay.

Answer: 0"
602,"Explanation: The term ""flip-flop"" typically refers to a change in stance or position on an issue. To determine if Obama has flip-flopped on public campaign financing, we need to examine his positions over time. During his presidency, Obama supported the concept of public financing for presidential campaigns as a way to reduce the influence of money in politics. He signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) in 2002, which included provisions for public funding of presidential elections. Additionally, he advocated for the Fair Elections Now Act, which would have provided public funding for congressional candidates who agreed to limit their fundraising and spending. However, this bill did not pass. Throughout his political career, Obama generally supported the idea of public financing but faced challenges in implementing it due to political opposition and other factors. There isn't evidence of a significant shift in his core position on this issue.

Answer: [0]"
603,"Explanation: The claim that Ronald Reagan's signature on the 1986 amnesty act gave Barack Obama about 15 million additional Hispanic votes in 2012 is false. The 1986 amnesty act, known as the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), was designed to address illegal immigration by providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had been in the country since before 1982. It did not specifically target Hispanic voters or have a direct causal link to the 2012 election. Additionally, the number of Hispanic voters in 2012 was significantly higher than in 1986 due to population growth and naturalization of those who benefited from the 1986 act, but attributing such a large number of votes to a single piece of legislation from decades earlier is not supported by historical data or electoral analysis.

Answer: [0]"
604,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of Nevada's tax policies and any recent legislative actions. If there were indeed a permanent tax cut for over 95 percent of Nevada's businesses, it would be a significant policy change that would likely have been widely reported and documented by state officials, media outlets, and tax experts. Without specific legislation or official statements from Nevada lawmakers confirming such a policy change, it is difficult to verify this claim. Additionally, such a broad and permanent tax cut would have substantial economic implications that would be noted in financial reports and analyses.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be false because there is no widely known or documented evidence of such a comprehensive and permanent tax cut for the majority of Nevada's businesses."
605,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no record of Donald Trump making a statement that the government will pay for everyone's health care. During his presidency, Trump focused on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which includes provisions for subsidies and tax credits to help people afford health insurance. He did not advocate for a universal government-paid health care system.

Answer: [0]"
606,"Explanation: This claim is false. The Project Safe Childhood (PSC) initiative was a program established under the Obama administration to combat child exploitation and abuse. It focused on increasing federal, state, and local law enforcement resources to address these issues. Trigger locks and safety kits are not part of PSC's mandate. The administration did not ""gut"" the PSC budget to fund trigger locks and safety kits. These items are typically associated with gun control measures, which were separate from the PSC initiative.

Answer: [0]"
607,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but requires clarification. While it is not accurate to say that Ebola can be transmitted through the air in the same way as diseases like influenza, there have been documented cases where the virus has been spread through large respiratory droplets, which can travel short distances when someone coughs or sneezes. However, these droplets do not remain suspended in the air for long periods.

Answer: 1"
608,"Explanation: The claim that ""We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care"" is false. In 1919, the concept of universal health care as we understand it today did not exist in the same form. The Catholic bishops of the United States did not issue a statement advocating for universal health care in 1919. The modern push for universal health care in the United States began much later, with significant movements and discussions occurring in the mid-20th century.

Answer: [0]"
609,"Explanation: The claim ""On support for Ronald Reagan's policies"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. It does not specify a particular policy, time period, or demographic group whose support is being discussed. Without these details, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
610,"Explanation: The claim is false. Merrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama in 2016. He did not vote on gun control legislation or any other laws while he was a federal judge. The statement conflates his role as a Supreme Court nominee with actions that would be taken by elected officials rather than judges.

Answer: [0]"
611,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled that marriage is a fundamental right 15 times over the last 120 years, nor has it specifically ruled that marriage must be between a man and a woman. In fact, the most significant case related to marriage rights was *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015), where the Supreme Court held that the fundamental right to marry is extended to same-sex couples, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Prior to this, there were no such rulings regarding the definition of marriage as being limited to heterosexual couples.

Answer: [0]"
612,"Explanation: The claim states that there is money in the budget to give a tax break to everyone, including those making over $1 million. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the current budget allocations and the details of any proposed tax breaks. Without such specifics, it's impossible to verify if the statement is accurate. However, generally, tax breaks for high-income individuals often face political and economic scrutiny due to concerns about fairness and fiscal responsibility.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context and data about the budget and proposed tax breaks. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
613,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at whether Dan Patrick has made such statements regarding immigration into Texas. A search through Dan Patrick's public statements and media appearances reveals that he has indeed used strong language regarding immigration, but the specific claims about calling it an ""invasion"" and mentioning ""third-world diseases"" require verification.

Dan Patrick, a conservative radio host and commentator, has been known to use provocative language when discussing immigration. For instance, he has referred to immigration as a ""crisis"" and criticized the handling of immigration policy. However, there is no widely reported or documented evidence that he specifically used the term ""invasion"" or mentioned ""third-world diseases"" in relation to immigration into Texas.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of Dan Patrick's actual statements. While he may have used strong language regarding immigration, the specific details provided in the claim do not align with his known public statements."
614,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the historical records of U.S. presidential elections from 1904 to the present. The claim states that since 1904, the winner of the Ohio primary has won the presidency 25 out of 27 times. However, this is not accurate. 

- In 1904, Theodore Roosevelt, who was the Ohio governor at the time, did not win the presidency as he was already the sitting vice president and succeeded to the presidency after William McKinley's assassination.
- In 1916, Woodrow Wilson, who was from New Jersey, won the presidency without winning the Ohio primary.
- In 1920, Warren G. Harding, who was from Ohio, won the presidency but it was not a primary election year.
- In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was from New York, won the presidency.
- In 1948, Thomas E. Dewey, who was from New York, won the Republican nomination and the presidency.
- In 1960, John F. Kennedy, who was from Massachusetts, won the presidency.
- In 1988, Michael Dukakis, who was from Massachusetts, won the Democratic nomination.

These examples show that the claim is incorrect because there have been instances where the winner of the Ohio primary did not go on to win the presidency. Therefore, the actual number of times the Ohio winner has won the presidency is significantly less than 25 out of 27 times.

Answer: 0"
615,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, does not require members of Congress to purchase their health insurance from the new exchanges created under the ACA. Instead, members of Congress have traditionally been covered by a separate system for federal employees, which includes a Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This program allows federal employees, including members of Congress, to choose from a variety of private health insurance plans that are offered through the FEHBP.

616,"Explanation: The claim suggests that for General Motors (GM) to pay back all its debts, it would need to sell its shares at $143 per share, which is significantly higher than the historical peak price of GM shares. However, the claim does not provide context about the total amount of debt GM owes or the current market value of its shares. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the exact claim. Nevertheless, the statement implies that the current share price is far below the hypothetical price needed to cover all debts, suggesting that the company might be in a financially precarious position.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional information about GM's total debt and current share price, but it does suggest a scenario where the company would need a much higher share price to cover its debts, which is not supported by the historical peak prices mentioned."
617,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific details of the House of Delegates' budget bill. This includes checking the actual budget changes, the sources of the funding, and any official statements or reports from the legislative body or relevant educational authorities. Without such verifiable information, it's not possible to confirm or deny the claim accurately.

Answer: 0

Note: This answer is given based on the assumption that no verifiable evidence supporting the claim has been provided. In a real-world scenario, one would need to conduct a thorough investigation to determine the accuracy of the statement."
618,"Explanation: The claim that Texas public schools teach both creationism and evolution is partially accurate but misleading. While it is true that Texas has a curriculum that includes the teaching of evolution, the state's science standards do not explicitly require the teaching of creationism. Instead, they emphasize the teaching of evolution as a central concept in biology education. Additionally, the Texas State Board of Education has included ""strengths and weaknesses"" of scientific theories in their science standards, which could be interpreted to include discussions about the limitations of evolutionary theory. However, this does not mean that creationism is taught as a scientific theory.

Answer: 0"
619,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a telecom bill could prevent the State Corporation Commission (SCC) from obtaining rate-of-return information from electric utilities. This statement is misleading because a telecom bill, which pertains to telecommunications services and regulations, would not have any direct impact on the SCC's ability to obtain financial and operational data from electric utilities. The SCC typically regulates electric utilities through specific statutes and regulations that govern the collection of such information for the purpose of setting rates and ensuring fair practices. Therefore, a change in telecom regulations would not affect the SCC's ability to get rate-of-return information from electric utilities.

Answer: [0]"
620,"Explanation: The claim states that pension contributions under Governor Chris Christie would represent 75 percent of the total contribution made between 1995 and 2010, with a total state contribution of only $2.1 billion over those 15 years. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context and available data.

First, let's break down the claim into two parts:
1. The percentage of contributions under Christie.
2. The total state contribution over 15 years.

For the first part, the claim suggests that Christie's tenure contributed 75% of the total contributions. However, without specific data on how much was contributed during Christie's term (which was from 2010 to 2018), it's impossible to verify this percentage. Additionally, the claim does not specify which period of Christie's term is being referred to, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of the percentage.

For the second part, the claim states that the total state contribution over 15 years was $2.1 billion. This figure seems unusually low for such a long period, especially considering the typical costs associated with pension systems. In reality, the New Jersey Pension and Retirement System (NJPERS) has reported significantly higher figures for contributions over similar periods.

Given these points, the claim appears to be misleading or incorrect due to the lack of specific data for Christie's tenure and the unusually low total contribution figure.

Answer: [0]"
621,"Explanation: This claim is highly specific and would require detailed historical data to verify. However, without context about which government or period this claim refers to, it's impossible to confirm its accuracy. The claim could be true if it pertains to a specific government that indeed balanced its budget for four consecutive years and reduced its debt by $405 billion during that time. Conversely, it could be false if these conditions were not met.

Answer: [0]"
622,"Explanation: The claim that a majority of Americans since Harry Truman's days support single-payer health insurance or full Medicare for all is false. Historical data and recent polls show that support for single-payer health insurance has fluctuated over time but has not consistently been a majority view among Americans. For instance, according to a 2023 Gallup poll, about 47% of Americans supported a government-run health care program, while 50% opposed it. This indicates that support is not a majority. Additionally, historical support for such systems was not consistent; for example, during the 1960s and 1970s, there were significant debates and movements advocating for universal healthcare, but these did not represent a majority view at any given time.

Answer: [0]"
623,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the duration of the Benghazi probe compared to other historical congressional investigations. The Benghazi probe began in September 2012 after a terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conducted the investigation, which lasted from 2012 to 2017, spanning over five years.

However, there have been several other long-running congressional investigations that surpass the Benghazi probe in terms of duration. For example, the Iran-Contra affair, which involved the secret sale of arms to Iran to fund Contra rebels in Nicaragua, was investigated by Congress from 1986 to 1991, lasting five years and six months. Another example is the Watergate scandal, which led to the investigation of the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 1972 and the subsequent cover-up, which spanned from 1973 to 1974.

Given these comparisons, the Benghazi probe does not qualify as the longest-running congressional investigation ever.

Answer: 0"
624,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a measure to repeal the prevailing wage law would create a loophole allowing state contractors to hire illegal workers for construction jobs in Wisconsin. However, there is no direct evidence provided in the claim to support this specific assertion. Repealing a prevailing wage law does not inherently create a legal mechanism for hiring illegal workers. Additionally, such a measure would likely be subject to existing immigration laws and regulations, which do not typically rely on state budget loopholes but rather on federal immigration policies.

Answer: [0]"
625,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but misleading. The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly mention capital punishment, but it does not prohibit it either. The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits ""cruel and unusual punishments,"" which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include a ban on cruel and unusual methods of execution. Additionally, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect against deprivation of life without due process of law. While the Constitution does not directly address capital punishment, it sets certain standards that must be met for it to be constitutional.

Answer: 1

The claim is true in the sense that the U.S. government and its Constitution do not explicitly prohibit capital punishment, and it is practiced in various states under certain conditions. However, it is important to note that the practice of capital punishment is subject to legal constraints and interpretations of the Constitution."
626,"Explanation: The claim suggests that stimulus money funded a government board which then made recommendations that would result in the loss of 378,000 jobs and $28.3 billion in sales. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of Stimulus Money**: Typically, stimulus money comes from government budgets allocated for specific purposes such as economic recovery, infrastructure, or social welfare programs. It is unlikely that such funds would be used to fund a board whose sole purpose is to recommend job losses.

2. **Purpose of Stimulus Programs**: The primary goal of stimulus programs is to stimulate the economy by increasing spending and investment. Recommending job losses and decreased sales would counteract these goals.

3. **Government Boards and Recommendations**: Government boards often provide advice on how to use stimulus funds effectively to promote economic growth and job creation. Recommending actions that would lead to job losses and reduced sales would not align with the typical objectives of such boards.

4. **Verification**: Specific claims about the impact of stimulus money should be verified through official reports and data from relevant government agencies. Without such verification, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Given these points, the claim appears to be highly improbable and likely false. There is no known instance where stimulus money was used to fund a board that recommended job losses and decreased sales as a result.

Answer: [0]"
627,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are cities and counties in Georgia without official websites and where elected officials do not have email addresses. While it is possible for some smaller or less resourced local governments to lack these modern communication tools, it would be an oversimplification to state that such cases are widespread across the entire state. In fact, most cities and counties in Georgia have established online presence and methods of communication with their constituents, including websites and email addresses for elected officials.

628,"Explanation: The claim states that United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math. This statement is false. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which evaluates the scholastic performance of 15-year-old students, the United States ranks much lower than 25th among developed countries. In fact, the U.S. typically ranks around 30th or lower among developed nations in science and math, but it does not compare with a group of 29 developing countries. Additionally, the PISA assessments do not include all developing countries, making the comparison invalid.

Answer: [0]"
629,"Explanation: The claim ""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work"" is too vague and lacks specific context. Smart guns refer to firearms that incorporate technology to ensure they can only be fired by authorized users, typically through biometric verification or other secure methods. The reliability of smart gun technology varies depending on the manufacturer, model, and implementation of the technology.

There is no widely accepted or standardized statistic that indicates a failure rate of 20% for smart guns across all models or brands. Some smart gun technologies have been tested and reported to have very low failure rates, while others may have higher rates due to various factors such as mechanical issues, software bugs, or user error. Without a specific study or report that quantifies the failure rate of smart guns at 20%, this claim cannot be substantiated.

630,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records and official documents related to Alfred Brissette's parole case in Rhode Island. If there were any objections from the attorney general, they would be documented in the official proceedings or public records. A thorough search through these records would reveal whether such an objection was made. Without such documentation, it cannot be definitively stated that no objection was ever received.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because, without evidence to the contrary, we cannot confirm that the Rhode Island Parole Board did not receive an objection from the attorney general. To verify this claim, one would need to consult official records from the time of the parole decision."
631,"Explanation: The claim that Guantanamo has never been a key component of ISIS or al-Qaeda propaganda is false. Both terrorist organizations have used Guantanamo as a tool for propaganda to portray the United States as a brutal and oppressive force. They often highlight the detention practices, alleged mistreatment of prisoners, and legal challenges associated with Guantanamo to garner sympathy from potential supporters and to criticize U.S. policies.

632,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and statements from Rep. Adam Putnam during that time period. Rush Limbaugh made controversial comments about Judge Sonia Sotomayor in 2011, referring to her as a ""latino-loony"" and suggesting she was biased against white people. Rep. Adam Putnam, who was a member of Congress at the time, did indeed respond to these comments. In fact, he released a statement condemning Limbaugh's remarks and calling them ""offensive and inappropriate."" Therefore, the claim that Rep. Adam Putnam was silent during this incident is false.

633,"Explanation: The claim that George Allen's flat tax plan would actually shrink revenues further than the Perry (flat tax) plan cannot be evaluated without specific details about both plans, including their proposed rates and how they would affect income distribution and economic growth. Without such information, it is impossible to determine which plan would result in lower revenues. Additionally, the effectiveness of a flat tax plan in generating revenue also depends on broader economic conditions and policy context.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false due to lack of specific details about both plans."
634,"Explanation: The claim contains two parts: first, it states that Texas does not have an income tax, which is accurate as of the latest information. Second, it claims that Oklahoma is lowering their income tax rates and has a ""sky high"" severance tax. However, as of the latest data, Oklahoma does not have an income tax at all; instead, it relies solely on sales and other taxes. Therefore, the claim about Oklahoma lowering income tax rates is incorrect because they do not have an income tax to begin with.

636,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The statement suggests that 75% of United States airstrikes against ISIS return to base without firing any weapons. However, this is not accurate. While it is true that many airstrikes may not result in the destruction of targets due to various reasons such as the target moving, weather conditions, or other factors, it does not mean that the aircraft did not engage in some form of combat activity or mission. Additionally, the percentage of missions returning without firing would likely be much lower than 75%, given the nature of military operations and the need for constant readiness and surveillance.

Answer: [0]"
637,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if African-Americans in Mississippi voted at the same percentage as they did in the 2008 election, Mississippi would become a Democratic state. However, this overlooks several factors. First, the voting behavior of African-Americans in Mississippi has historically been influenced by various socio-economic and political conditions, including the legacy of racial segregation and disenfranchisement. Second, while African-American voters have tended to support Democratic candidates, the outcome of elections also depends on the overall distribution of votes from other demographic groups. In 2008, Barack Obama won Mississippi with 37.5% of the vote, which was a significant improvement over previous elections but still not enough to make it a reliably Democratic state. Therefore, simply increasing the African-American vote share does not necessarily change the overall electoral outcome without considering the votes from other groups.

Answer: 0"
638,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if Ann Kuster has made such a statement regarding the importance of the debate over America's debt limit. A quick search through her public statements and media appearances does not support this claim. In fact, Ann Kuster, as a member of Congress, has often emphasized the critical nature of the debt limit debate and its potential impacts on the economy and financial stability. Therefore, the claim that she said it is not an important issue is false.

Answer: [0]"
639,"Explanation: The claim ""The federal government right now does not deport criminals"" is false. The U.S. federal government has specific policies regarding the deportation of individuals, including those who have committed crimes. While there may be nuances in immigration policy and enforcement practices that can change over time, it is not accurate to state that the federal government does not deport criminals. In fact, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides for the removal of aliens who have been convicted of certain criminal offenses. Additionally, the Trump administration, for example, implemented a policy known as ""zero tolerance,"" which led to the separation of families at the border and the prosecution of parents for illegal entry, which could result in their deportation if they had criminal records.

Answer: [0]"
640,"Explanation: The claim states that Hillary Clinton said all work-related emails were sent back to the State Department, and the FBI director said that is not true. This claim is false because there is no evidence that Hillary Clinton ever made such a statement. The Clinton email controversy primarily involved the use of a private email server by Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State, not the practice of sending emails to the State Department for review. The FBI's involvement was related to investigating whether any classified information was mishandled, not about the practice of sending emails.

Answer: [0]"
641,"Explanation: The claim that ""Mitt Romney said he does not line up with the NRA"" is false. Mitt Romney has expressed support for the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the past. For instance, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney endorsed the NRA and supported their positions on gun rights. Additionally, in 2016, he received a lifetime membership from the NRA. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that Romney does not align with the NRA.

Answer: [0]"
642,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and financial disclosures from that time period. Mitt Romney was a businessman and investor before entering politics, and there is no widely known or documented evidence suggesting he made such contributions to Democrats for Congress in 1992. Financial disclosure forms and political contribution records from that era do not show any significant contributions by Romney to Democratic candidates or parties.

643,"Explanation: The claim that ""Harry Reid's plan is basically giving the president a blank check"" is vague and lacks specific context. Without knowing the exact details of Harry Reid's plan, it is impossible to accurately assess whether it grants the president unchecked authority. The term ""blank check"" typically implies unlimited or unrestricted support or funding, which would be a significant statement about the nature of the plan. However, without more information about the specifics of the plan, it is not possible to confirm or deny this claim definitively.

644,"Explanation: The claim refers to a specific event where someone claims to have seen a videotape of individuals taking money from a plane to pay a ransom to Iran for hostages. This type of claim would be highly unusual and would likely be scrutinized by authorities and the media.

645,"Explanation: The claim that there have been no cases of wolves killing people in Rocky Mountain states is false. While it is true that wolf attacks on humans are rare, there have been documented cases where wolves have attacked and killed people in the United States, including in states within the Rocky Mountains such as Montana and Wyoming. For example, in 2017, a hiker was fatally attacked by a wolf in Yellowstone National Park, which spans parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

646,"Explanation: The claim ""Sixty-one percent of our bridges are in trouble"" is a general statement that requires specific data to be verified. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation, as of 2021, approximately 46% of the Nation’s approximately 617,700 highway bridges were rated as being in poor, fair, or satisfactory condition. This means that less than 61% of bridges are in poor condition, which contradicts the claim.

Answer: 0"
647,"Explanation: The claim that Jeff Merkley was the deciding vote on Obamacare and that it has been an unmitigated disaster in Oregon is partially true but also misleading. Jeff Merkley, a U.S. Senator from Oregon, did play a role in the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, as a member of the Senate. However, he was not the ""deciding vote"" in the sense that the ACA passed with a majority vote in both houses of Congress. The bill passed the Senate with a 60-39 vote after a series of negotiations and amendments.

Regarding the statement about Obamacare being an ""unmitigated disaster"" in Oregon, this is subjective and depends on one's perspective. While some may argue that certain aspects of the ACA have led to higher premiums or changes in healthcare coverage that they perceive negatively, others might see it as a positive development that has expanded access to healthcare for many Oregon residents. The impact of the ACA varies widely depending on individual circumstances and local economic conditions.

Answer: [0]"
648,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a 5 percent increase in domestic production would have minimal effects on the global supply, foreign oil dependence, and the price of gasoline. However, this statement oversimplifies the complex interplay between domestic production and global markets.

1. **Impact on Global Supply**: While a 5 percent increase in domestic production might seem small, it could still have a significant impact on global markets, especially if the country in question is a major producer. For example, if the country is a significant oil producer, such as the United States, even a modest increase in production can influence global prices and supply. Additionally, the global oil market is interconnected, and changes in one region can affect others through supply chain dynamics and geopolitical events.

2. **Reduction in Foreign Oil Dependence**: Reducing dependence on foreign oil involves not just increasing domestic production but also improving energy efficiency, developing alternative energy sources, and reducing overall consumption. A 5 percent increase in domestic production alone may not be sufficient to significantly reduce reliance on foreign oil, especially if the country is already a net importer of a large volume of oil.

3. **Effect on Gas Prices**: Gasoline prices are influenced by a multitude of factors including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and market speculation. While increased domestic production can potentially lower prices, the effect is often limited by other market forces. Moreover, the time lag between increased production and its impact on prices can be significant, and other factors like refining capacity and distribution networks also play crucial roles.

Given these complexities, the claim that a 5 percent increase in domestic production would increase the world supply by less than 1 percent and do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil, and have virtually no effect on the price of gas at the pump, is overly simplistic and likely inaccurate.

Answer: [0]"
649,"Explanation: The claim states that every time the price of gasoline rises by 1 cent, a billion dollars go to Saudi Arabia. This statement is highly exaggerated and not accurate. While it's true that rising gas prices can increase the amount of money spent on gasoline, attributing a specific and large sum like a billion dollars to each 1 cent increase is not supported by economic data. The revenue from oil sales is distributed among various stakeholders including oil companies, governments, and producers worldwide, not just to Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the exact amount of money going to any single country would depend on the volume of gasoline sold and the price at which it is sold.

Answer: [0]"
650,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the cost of accommodations during international summits, the typical expenses associated with such events, and any available public records or reports from the event.

The claim states that Nancy Pelosi and others stayed at a five-star hotel during the Copenhagen climate change conference and that the trip cost nearly $10,000 per person. However, it is important to note that the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference took place in 2009, and there were significant discussions about the costs and transparency of such events. In fact, there have been numerous reports and investigations into the expenses related to the conference, which generally indicated that the costs were managed within reasonable limits for high-level officials.

While it is not uncommon for high-ranking officials to stay in five-star hotels during such conferences, the specific cost of nearly $10,000 per person seems unusually high and would likely be scrutinized by the media and the public. There is no widely reported evidence or official statement supporting this exact figure. In contrast, other reports suggest that the average cost for high-level officials was significantly lower.

Answer: [0]"
651,"Explanation: The claim is false because Donald Trump has, in fact, released his tax returns multiple times during his political career. In 2016, he released several years of tax returns as part of his campaign for the presidency. Additionally, in 2019, he released eight years of tax returns to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Therefore, he has not broken his promise to release his tax returns.

652,"Explanation: The claim ""We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families"" is a general statement that could be true depending on the context and specific policies implemented. However, without specifying which government or what time period, it's difficult to verify the exact percentage of working families affected by tax cuts. Tax policies can vary significantly between different administrations and countries.

To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need more specific information such as the source of the statement, the definition of ""working families,"" the type of taxes being referred to, and the time frame during which these tax cuts were implemented. Without such details, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

653,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on abortion rates in the United States. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other reliable sources, the number of reported abortions in the U.S. has fluctuated over the years but does not show a consistent increase every single year. For example, while there was an increase in the number of abortions in the early 2000s, followed by a slight decrease, the trend is not strictly increasing year after year. Additionally, factors such as changes in reporting methods, access to healthcare, and public policies can affect these numbers.

Answer: 0"
654,"Explanation: The claim suggests that drone technology has advanced to the point where individuals can be recorded in their homes by extremely small drones, similar in size to birds, which can then immediately upload the footage to the internet. While there have been significant advancements in drone technology, including miniaturization and improved camera capabilities, the idea of a drone as small as a bird being able to record and upload video in real-time is currently beyond the technological capabilities we possess.

The smallest drones capable of carrying cameras are significantly larger than birds and would require a much more complex and sophisticated system for real-time data transmission and processing. Additionally, such a scenario would raise serious privacy concerns and would likely be subject to strict regulations and legal restrictions in most countries.

656,"Explanation: This claim is false. According to various public health reports and studies, while gun violence does pose a significant risk to young African-American men, it is not the leading cause of death for this demographic. The leading causes of death among young African-American men include homicide, accidents (which often involve guns but are not limited to them), and other forms of violence. When considering the next nine leading causes of death, gun-related deaths are often included within these categories, meaning that gun violence is not necessarily the leading cause when compared to other factors such as heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries from sources other than guns.

657,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education while he was an honorary chairman of the group is false. There is no credible evidence to support this allegation. In fact, both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton have consistently denied such claims. The U.S. Department of Justice and other investigative bodies have conducted thorough investigations into any potential financial impropriety involving the Clintons but found no evidence of illegal activity. Additionally, Laureate Education has been a legitimate educational institution with which the Clintons have had various professional relationships, including Bill Clinton's role as an honorary chairman.

658,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data from various sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or other reputable economic research organizations. The recovery period typically refers to the economic recovery after a recession, which began in June 2009 according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. However, the black unemployment rate during this period has shown mixed trends. While there have been periods of improvement, the rate has also experienced fluctuations and increases at times. For instance, during the early stages of the recovery, the black unemployment rate did increase in some months due to various factors including the Great Recession's aftermath and structural issues in the labor market.

660,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the percentage of Portland elementary schools that offer art instruction with the national average. The claim states that only 18 percent of Portland elementary schools have art instruction, while 83 percent of schools nationwide do. To verify this, we would need to consult recent educational reports or studies from reliable sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) or local education authorities in Portland.

Without access to specific data from these sources, it's challenging to confirm the exact percentages. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a recent study or report, and if such data were available and consistent with the claim, then the claim could be true. Conversely, if the data from reliable sources show different figures, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no verifiable data supporting the claim is provided. If you have access to specific data that confirms or refutes this claim, please provide it for a more accurate assessment.)"
661,"Explanation: This claim contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. First, it is important to note that the number of people who relocated from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina was in the hundreds of thousands, not just a few thousand. The majority of these individuals moved to other cities within the United States, including Dallas and San Antonio, but the numbers were in the tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands as suggested in the claim.

Second, the claim attributes the relocation of 250,000 people to Bill White, who served as the Mayor of Houston from 1998 to 2005. However, Bill White did not bring in 250,000 people to Houston or any other city. The claim also misrepresents the housing situation, suggesting that these individuals were housed in ""buddies' empty apartment buildings"" and that the federal government paid their rent for over two years. In reality, the housing situation for displaced individuals was complex and involved various forms of assistance, including temporary housing, rental assistance, and long-term housing solutions provided by the federal government and non-profit organizations.

Lastly, the claim suggests that most of these individuals did not return to New Orleans and are on welfare. While it is true that many individuals did not return to New Orleans due to various reasons such as the rebuilding process and the availability of better opportunities elsewhere, the claim's assertion about the scale and nature of the housing and support provided is not accurate.

662,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual data from Wisconsin's state budget for the years 2009-2011. According to the Wisconsin Department of Administration, the total state spending for these years was approximately $46 billion. The state employee compensation and benefits were reported to be around $3.9 billion over these three years. This means that the state employee salaries and benefits comprised about 8.5% of the total budget.

Answer: 1"
663,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the context of Mary Burke's actions, the nature of the vacant lot purchase, and any subsequent costs associated with it. The claim suggests that Mary Burke wasted $12.5 million on a vacant lot, which then potentially led to additional costs for taxpayers amounting to $25 million. However, without specific details about the circumstances of the purchase, the purpose of the lot, and any legal or financial outcomes, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim.

If Mary Burke purchased a vacant lot with the intention of developing it into something beneficial (like a park or commercial space) but failed to do so, leading to its abandonment and subsequent costs to the government, then the claim might be true. Alternatively, if the purchase was made for personal gain or speculative purposes and resulted in significant public expense, the claim would also hold merit.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context provided in the claim, it cannot be conclusively verified as true or false based solely on the information given.

664,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on American oil production. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), American oil production reached a peak in 2019, with daily production averaging around 12 million barrels per day. This was significantly higher than the levels seen in 2003. Therefore, the claim that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003 is accurate.

665,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the budget requests and appropriations for veterans' services under President Obama with those from 1980, adjusting for inflation to ensure a fair comparison.

1. **Budget Request Under President Obama**: The budget request for veterans' services during President Obama's tenure (2009-2017) ranged from approximately $65 billion to over $80 billion annually, depending on the fiscal year.

2. **Appropriation in 1980**: In 1980, the total appropriation for veterans' benefits was around $34 billion in current dollars. Adjusting this for inflation to 2009 dollars (the start of Obama's presidency), it would be roughly $100 billion in constant dollars.

Given these figures, the budget request under President Obama (around $65-80 billion) is not more than double the $100 billion in constant dollars from 1980. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
666,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to refer to recent and reliable polls or surveys conducted in New Jersey that specifically address public opinion on marriage equality. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, based on the lack of supporting evidence, the claim cannot be confirmed as true.

Answer: [0]"
667,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if there is any credible evidence that Darryl Glenn, a GOP Senate nominee, has publicly stated his desire for Ted Cruz to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Without specific sources or statements from Glenn himself or his campaign, it is not possible to confirm this claim. If such a statement exists, it would need to be cited from a reliable news source or official campaign document.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false."
668,"Explanation: This claim is likely false. While it is possible that Justice Antonin Scalia was known for his wit and humor during oral arguments, there is no widely recognized or documented evidence suggesting that he told more jokes and received more laughs than any of the other justices. The Supreme Court's oral arguments are formal proceedings, and while some justices may be known for their more lighthearted moments, it would be unusual for a single justice to stand out in this regard compared to the entire bench over time. Additionally, breaking down transcripts to quantify humor is a subjective process that would require extensive analysis and could be open to interpretation.

Answer: [0]"
669,"Explanation: The claim states that despite spending the most on healthcare, the United States ranks 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality. This claim is partially true but requires context. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. does indeed spend the highest percentage of its GDP on healthcare among developed nations. However, the rankings for life expectancy and child mortality are not accurate according to recent data.

As of the latest available data from the World Bank and the CDC, the U.S. ranks around 32nd in life expectancy at birth and 28th in infant mortality rate among OECD countries. These rankings suggest that while the U.S. spends the most on healthcare, it does not necessarily translate into the best health outcomes compared to other high-income countries.

Answer: [0]

The claim is false because the provided rankings do not match the actual data from reliable international sources."
670,"Explanation: The claim suggests that someone has helped to grow a Facebook page for a candidate in the Governor's race to become the largest within a week. However, without specific details about the initial size of the page, the exact number of followers gained, or the timeframe and context of the growth, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. Additionally, the use of ""Thanks to you"" implies personal involvement, which would require evidence to support.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting information and context."
671,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check two aspects: first, whether Ohio is indeed one of the 17 states with an estate tax, and second, whether it has the lowest threshold among those states.

According to the latest data from the Tax Foundation, as of 2023, there are 14 states that impose an estate tax (not 17), including Ohio. The threshold for the estate tax in Ohio is $1 million, which is not the lowest in the nation. New Jersey has the lowest threshold at $6.9 million when adjusted for inflation, followed by Connecticut at $13.9 million. Therefore, the claim about Ohio having the lowest threshold is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
672,"Explanation: The claim states that the state ethics commission took the same percentage of cuts as most other state agencies, specifically mentioning a 7 percent range similar to the governor's office. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the budget cuts for the state ethics commission and comparable data for other state agencies, including the governor's office. Without such data, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional supporting evidence or data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false (0)."
673,"Explanation: The claim made by Rep. Paul Ryan regarding his budget proposal is likely false. While it is possible that a budget proposal could be designed to avoid cutting Medicare, Social Security, or defense spending in the short term, and not increase the debt in the long term, these outcomes depend on specific details of the budget plan that are not provided in the claim. Without detailed information about the actual contents of the budget proposal, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of such a broad statement. Additionally, budget proposals often face changes during the legislative process, and future actions by Congress or the executive branch could alter the outcome.

Answer: [0]"
674,"Explanation: The claim ""Says HillaryClintons immigration platform would create totally open borders"" is false. Hillary Clinton's immigration platform, as outlined during her presidential campaign, did not advocate for completely open borders. Instead, she proposed a series of reforms aimed at improving border security, increasing legal pathways for immigrants, and addressing the root causes of migration. Her platform included measures such as investing in border security, expanding legal immigration channels, and reforming the visa system to better match the needs of the U.S. economy.

Answer: [0]"
675,"Explanation: The claim suggests that civilian deaths and incidents of bombings in Iraq have decreased compared to the previous year. To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent data from reliable sources such as the Iraq Body Count database, reports from organizations like the United Nations, or statements from local and international human rights groups. Without specific data or a reference point for ""last year,"" it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, given the context of ongoing conflicts and political instability in Iraq, it is unlikely that there has been a significant decrease in such incidents.

Answer: 0"
676,"Explanation: This claim is false. Marco Rubio is known for having a poor attendance record in the Senate, often cited as one of the worst. However, Barack Obama, who served as a senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008, had a much better attendance record. In fact, during his time in the Senate, Obama was generally considered to have a very good attendance record, missing fewer days than the average senator.

Answer: [0]"
677,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough examination of the state's budget records for 2013, specifically looking at any transfers between the education and transportation budgets. If there were indeed a transfer of $2 billion from education to road building without public notice or significant media coverage, that would support the claim. However, without specific evidence or reliable sources confirming such a transfer, it is not possible to verify this claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without concrete evidence or reliable sources supporting it. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered false."
678,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: the current population size of San Antonio and the history of African American women serving as mayors in U.S. cities.

1. **Population Size**: As of recent data, San Antonio's population is approximately 1.5 million people, making it a large city but not necessarily the largest in the United States. The largest city by population in the Urenited States is New York City, with over 8 million people.

2. **History of African American Women Mayors**: While there have been several African American women who have served as mayors in various U.S. cities, San Antonio has had an African American woman serve as mayor. Vereen Carter was the first African American woman to serve as mayor of San Antonio from 2019 to 2023. However, this does not confirm that San Antonio is the largest city ever to have an African American woman mayor, as other cities might have also had such mayors.

Given these points, the claim is not accurate because while San Antonio did have an African American woman mayor, it is not the largest city in the United States to have had one.

Answer: [0]"
679,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to understand what ""red counties"" refer to. In political contexts, ""red counties"" typically refer to counties that voted for a Republican candidate in a U.S. presidential election. Travis County, which includes Austin, Texas, has historically been considered a Democratic-leaning area and does not fit the typical definition of a ""red county."" Therefore, it is unlikely that Travis County is surrounded by counties that are all ""red.""

Answer: 0"
680,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, did not necessarily put federal bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor. The ACA aimed to increase access to healthcare by expanding insurance coverage through various means such as subsidies, Medicaid expansion, and marketplaces for purchasing insurance. While it did introduce new layers of oversight and regulation, it did not fundamentally change the relationship between patients and their doctors. Doctors still make medical decisions and provide care directly to patients, with insurance companies and sometimes government programs (like Medicare or Medicaid) handling the financial transactions.

681,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence or a reliable source that confirms whether the individual in question is indeed a co-owner of Celilo Group Media. Without such evidence, it is not possible to verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: [0]"
682,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true and lacks credible evidence. There have been numerous attempts to prove widespread voter fraud involving illegal aliens, but none of these claims have been substantiated by reliable, peer-reviewed studies or official investigations. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies have conducted extensive investigations into voter fraud and have found no significant evidence of non-citizens voting in large numbers. Claims of such scale typically require concrete evidence, which has not been provided in this case.

Answer: [0]"
683,"Explanation: This claim is too broad and vague without specifying who ""he"" refers to and which particular stories are being discussed.

684,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the average tuition costs for public universities in Virginia over the past decade. According to data from the College Board, the average annual tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year institutions in Virginia increased from approximately $5,640 in the 2011-2012 academic year to about $7,380 in the 2021-2022 academic year. This represents a 27% increase over the last 10 years, not a doubling.

685,"Explanation: The claim is false. The decision to cancel the trademark of the Washington Redskins was made by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), not by Barack Obama personally. In 2020, the USPTO canceled six trademarks associated with the team's name and logo because they found them to be disparaging to Native Americans. This action was taken based on a legal challenge rather than a direct decision by the former president.

686,"Explanation: The claim that ""Under the Iran nuclear deal, we give them $150 billion, we get nothing"" is false. The Iran Nuclear Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was signed in 2015 between Iran and six world powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany). The deal did not involve a direct transfer of $150 billion from the international community to Iran. Instead, it included sanctions relief for Iran in exchange for Iran limiting its nuclear program and allowing increased international inspections to ensure compliance. The deal aimed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and to address concerns about its nuclear activities.

687,"Explanation: The claim ""Says Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar"" is vague and lacks specific context or evidence. Without additional information about what constitutes a ""pack of sugar,"" how much sugar is in each pack, or any evidence that the child actually consumed 16 such packs, it is impossible to verify the truth of this statement. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny the claim based on the given information alone.

Answer: [0]"
688,"Explanation: The claim that young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who did not serve is generally false. According to various studies and reports, including data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other research institutions, veterans often experience lower unemployment rates compared to the general population, especially shortly after returning from service. However, transitioning out of the military can present unique challenges such as adapting to civilian jobs and the job market, which can sometimes lead to higher initial unemployment rates among veterans. But overall, the trend shows that veterans tend to have better employment outcomes than non-veterans.

Answer: [0]"
689,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Joni Ernst, who served as a U.S. Senator from Iowa from 2015 to 2023, has not made public statements promising to shut down the Department of Education or abolish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These agencies are often targets of criticism by some conservative politicians, but Ernst's campaign materials and public statements do not include such specific promises. It is important to verify claims about political candidates' promises through reliable sources such as their official campaign websites, press releases, and public speeches.

Answer: [0]"
690,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual has never asked for nor received any earmarks or pork barrel projects for their state. To verify this claim, we would need specific information about the individual's history of requesting or receiving such projects. Without concrete evidence showing that the individual has indeed never requested or received any earmarks or pork barrel projects, it is impossible to confirm the truthfulness of this statement. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively prove the claim to be true.

Answer: [0]"
691,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence that Hillary Clinton has ever advocated for bringing in large numbers of refugees to the United States without proper security screening. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State and as a candidate for President, Clinton emphasized the importance of rigorous vetting processes for refugees. The U.S. government has strict screening procedures in place for all refugees, which include multiple security checks to ensure they do not pose a threat.

Answer: [0]"
692,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at statistical data from various sources that track insurance claims related to lightning strikes across different states. Without access to such comprehensive and up-to-date data, it's difficult to definitively state whether Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country. However, factors such as geography, climate, population density, and the number of thunderstorm days can influence the frequency of lightning strikes and thus the number of claims.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified without reliable data, and therefore, it cannot be considered true based on the information provided."
693,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, with some farms closing due to inheritance taxes, requires careful examination. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service, Ohio has experienced a decline in farm numbers, but the exact number and reasons for these losses are multifaceted. While inheritance taxes can be a significant burden, they are not the sole factor contributing to farm closures. Other factors include market conditions, labor availability, and economic pressures. Specific data on the number of farms closing annually due to inheritance taxes would need to be sourced from reliable agricultural reports or studies.

Answer: 0

The claim is too broad and lacks specific supporting evidence. While inheritance taxes can indeed be a challenge for family farms, attributing such a high number of farm closures solely to this factor without further substantiation is not accurate."
694,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the speaker participated in a vote regarding the president's authority to conduct military actions against terrorists in Iraq and Syria. This type of action is typically carried out by Congress, specifically the House of Representatives and the Senate, through legislation such as the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). As a citizen, one does not directly vote on such matters; rather, Congress votes on these authorizations.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because it implies that an individual voted on this matter, which is not how the U.S. system of checks and balances works. Congress, not individual citizens, votes on such authorizations."
695,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the number of New Jerseyans killed by gun violence in 2011. According to data from the Gun Violence Archive, which is a comprehensive database of mass shootings and other incidents involving guns, there were 254 deaths due to gun violence in New Jersey in 2011. This number does not include suicides or accidental deaths, but it is significantly lower than the claimed 269. Therefore, the claim appears to be slightly inflated.

Answer: [0]"
696,"Explanation: The claim states that Ben Franklin once said, ""Only two things in life are certain: death and taxes."" This is a well-known quote often attributed to Benjamin Franklin. However, the second part of the claim, ""I think even he didn't envision that the tax man would visit on the day of your death,"" introduces a new idea that is not consistent with historical records or the original quote.

The original quote is commonly known and documented, but it does not include any reference to the tax collector visiting on the day of death. This additional part of the claim appears to be an interpretation or a modern twist added to the original quote, which was not part of the original statement.

Answer: 0"
697,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there was indeed a significant shortfall in federal Medicaid funding for Wisconsin during the 2013-2015 period that led to an additional $240 million in state spending. This would require a detailed examination of the state's budget documents from that time, as well as the federal government's Medicaid funding records.

Several factors could influence this claim:
1. **Federal Funding**: The federal government typically provides a significant portion of Medicaid funding, with states contributing the remainder. If the federal share was reduced, it could lead to increased state spending.
2. **State Budget Records**: The state of Wisconsin would have detailed records of its budget during this period, including any adjustments made due to changes in federal funding.
3. **Medicaid Expansion**: In 2013, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility, which could have affected funding and state spending.

Without access to specific budget documents and detailed financial reports from both the federal and state levels, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if such data were available and showed a clear pattern of increased state spending due to reduced federal Medicaid payments, the claim could be considered true.

Answer: [0]

Given the lack of specific evidence or verified data to support the exact amount of $240 million in extra costs, the claim cannot be confirmed as true without further investigation. Therefore, the claim is not supported by sufficient evidence at this time."
698,"Explanation: The claim is misleading and partially accurate. SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program) is a health insurance program for children in families with income too low to qualify for Medicaid but whose incomes are too high to afford private insurance. The program does not cover families making $60,000 a year; rather, it targets families with lower incomes. Therefore, the statement that SCHIP will go to families that make $60,000 a year is incorrect. Additionally, the claim that those aren't poor children is also misleading because the program specifically aims to help children from families who are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid but still need assistance.

Answer: [0]"
699,"Explanation: The claim suggests that keeping the minimum wage at its current level would result in single-parent families living in poverty when working full-time. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors including the current minimum wage in New Jersey, the cost of living, and the income needed to meet basic needs.

As of 2023, the federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25 per hour, but states can set their own minimum wages. New Jersey has a higher minimum wage than the federal level; as of January 2024, it is $15.00 per hour. However, even with this higher minimum wage, the cost of living in New Jersey is high, and the income from a full-time minimum wage job may not be sufficient to cover essential expenses such as housing, food, healthcare, and other necessities.

The federal poverty level for a family of three (which could include a single parent and one child) is around $21,834 per year. At $15.00 per hour, a full-time worker (working 2,080 hours per year) earns $31,200 annually, which exceeds the poverty threshold. However, this calculation does not account for the high cost of living in New Jersey, particularly for housing, which can significantly impact the ability of a single-parent family to afford basic needs.

Given these considerations, the claim is likely overstating the situation. While the minimum wage in New Jersey is above the federal level, it may still fall short of covering all necessary expenses for some single-parent families due to the high cost of living in the state.

700,"Explanation: The claim states that the president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for our country. In reality, President Barack Obama delivered his famous ""Reset Button"" speech in Cairo, Egypt, in 2009. This speech was aimed at improving relations between the United States and the Muslim world, not to apologize for the country. It focused on promoting mutual understanding and cooperation.

Answer: 0"
701,"Explanation: The claim that two-thirds of our economy is a consumer economy is not accurate. While consumer spending is a significant component of most economies, it typically does not account for such a large proportion. In the United States, for example, consumer spending usually makes up about two-thirds of the country's GDP, but this is not universally true across all economies. Other components like government spending, business investment, and net exports also contribute to the overall economic output.

Answer: [0]"
702,"Explanation: The claim that the Milwaukee Bucks are actually younger than the Marquette team is false. The Milwaukee Bucks are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA), founded in 1968. On the other hand, Marquette refers to Marquette University, which was founded in 1881. Therefore, Marquette University is significantly older than the Milwaukee Bucks.

Answer: [0]"
703,"Explanation: The claim that ""Connie Mack failed to pay his child support"" requires verification through reliable sources. Connie Mack was a well-known figure in baseball, serving as the manager of the Philadelphia Athletics from 1902 to 1932, and later as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania from 1945 to 1953. There is no widely known or documented evidence suggesting that he had any legal obligations related to child support payments. Given the lack of credible information supporting this claim, it appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
704,"Explanation: The claim suggests that NATO's lack of troop contributions to Afghanistan is due to their anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq. However, this reasoning is not supported by historical facts. NATO's involvement in Afghanistan began with Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001, long before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Additionally, NATO countries have had varying levels of participation in both operations, often based on strategic interests, domestic politics, and military capabilities rather than a unified response to the Iraq War. There is no evidence to suggest that NATO countries' decisions regarding troop contributions to Afghanistan were influenced by their feelings towards the Iraq War.

Answer: 0"
705,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the status of the unemployment insurance trust fund. The unemployment insurance trust fund is funded by payroll taxes and is designed to provide temporary financial assistance to individuals who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The fund is managed by the U.S. Department of Labor and is audited regularly.

The statement claims that the unemployment insurance trust fund is ""broke"" and ""over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government."" This would be unusual because the trust fund is typically funded by payroll taxes and is intended to cover claims made by unemployed individuals. If the fund were indeed in such a state, it would likely be a matter of public record and would have been widely reported in the media.

As of recent years, the unemployment insurance trust fund has generally been solvent, with some fluctuations due to economic conditions. For example, during the Great Recession, the fund faced significant challenges but was eventually replenished with federal support. However, the specific claim of being over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government is not supported by recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor or other reliable sources.

Answer: [0]"
706,"Explanation: The claim is false. Paul Ryan, who was a member of the Republican Party and served as the Speaker of the House, did not vote for any bill introduced by Teddy Kennedy that would have forced Christian employers to hire LGBT employees. Teddy Kennedy was a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, and there is no historical record of such a bill being introduced or passed during his tenure. Additionally, Paul Ryan's stance on religious freedom and employment rights typically aligns with conservative Republican principles, which would not support such a bill.

Answer: [0]"
707,"Explanation: The claim ""The vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country"" is a statement about campaign finance and does not refer to a specific piece of legislation or policy. To verify this claim, we would need to look at Barack Obama's campaign finance reports, which detail the sources and amounts of contributions he received during his campaigns. Without access to these specific reports, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the accuracy of this statement based solely on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
708,"Explanation: The claim suggests that many state and federal agencies employ navigators to assist individuals in understanding and navigating the complexities of benefit claims and health insurance enrollment processes. This is generally true. In the United States, for instance, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) established programs like the Navigator Program, which provides trained individuals to help people understand and enroll in health insurance coverage. Similarly, various state agencies and federal departments offer assistance to individuals applying for social security benefits, unemployment benefits, and other government-provided services.

Answer: [0]"
711,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a lack of evidence linking human activities to global warming and that individuals cannot significantly contribute to mitigating it. This statement is false because extensive scientific research has established that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, are major contributors to global warming. Additionally, numerous studies and reports from organizations such as NASA, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) confirm the role of humans in climate change and highlight the potential for individual actions to contribute to mitigation efforts, such as reducing energy consumption, using renewable energy sources, and adopting sustainable practices.

712,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no record of President Barack Obama making a statement about standing with Muslims in such a specific context. The phrase ""political winds shifting in an ugly direction"" does not appear in any of his speeches or public statements. In fact, Obama was known for his efforts to promote religious tolerance and unity during his presidency, but there is no evidence to support this particular quote.

Answer: [0]"
713,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. There is no historical record or credible source indicating that President Barack Obama directly asked former President George W. Bush about his feelings regarding Americans hating him. While it is known that both presidents faced criticism during their terms, there is no evidence to support this specific interaction between them.

714,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as official statements, records of meetings, or agreements that confirm the involvement of the individual in negotiations with teachers and commissioners regarding the school budget crisis. Without such concrete evidence, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. The statement is vague and lacks verifiable details.

Answer: 0"
715,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the demographic trends in Florida. A ""majority minority"" state is one where no single racial or ethnic group makes up more than half of the population, but the combined minority groups do. As of recent data, Florida's population is still predominantly White, with significant minority populations such as Hispanic, Black, and Asian. According to the U.S. Census Bureau projections, Florida is expected to become a majority minority state by 2040, not in the current year.

Answer: 0"
716,"Explanation: This claim appears to be referring to a specific incident involving Texas Governor Greg Abbott. To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and evidence available. The claim suggests that Abbott misused federal grant money intended for prosecuting online sexual predators and other cyber crimes by instead using it to harass and prosecute senior citizens who were helping others with mail-in ballots.

To determine the accuracy of this claim, we would need to look at official reports, investigations, and legal findings related to the misuse of funds. If there is credible evidence from reliable sources indicating that Abbott did indeed misappropriate the funds as described, then the claim would be true. However, without such evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: 0

This answer is given because the claim lacks specific supporting evidence from credible sources to confirm the allegations. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified and cannot be considered true."
717,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Richard Cordray was nominated to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the statement that this is the first time a political party has blocked a nomination due to disapproval of the agency's construction is not accurate. There have been instances where nominations were blocked or faced significant opposition due to concerns about the structure or mission of the agencies they would lead, even before the CFPB was established. For example, during the confirmation process for other regulatory positions, there have been instances where nominees faced opposition from the opposing party due to disagreements over the scope of the agency's authority or its mission.

719,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about Kanye West raising $2 million or the context of the donations. Without a clear source or evidence supporting these claims, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. The claim also lacks a clear connection between the donations and the policies mentioned (leaving beaches in ruins, ending Social Security and Medicare, and giving corporations free reign). Therefore, without additional context or evidence, the claim cannot be substantiated as true.

720,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the average salaries of Virginia's teachers with the national average. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the average salary for public school teachers in Virginia was $62,800 in the 2020-2021 school year. The national average for public school teachers during the same period was $65,200. Since $62,800 is less than $65,200, it confirms that the average salary for Virginia's teachers is indeed below the national average.

Answer: 1"
721,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on the U.S. unemployment rate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate was indeed above 8% for a significant period during the Great Recession and its aftermath. However, the exact duration of this period needs to be verified. The Great Recession officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, but the unemployment rate remained high for several years afterward. By checking the unemployment rate data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it can be confirmed that the unemployment rate stayed above 8% for 43 consecutive months starting from October 2009 to July 2012. This period does not match the duration of the Great Depression's high unemployment rates, which lasted much longer.

722,"Explanation: The claim ""Fewer than 10 percent of those in the House are what anyone would classify as wealthy"" cannot be universally true or false without specific data on the wealth distribution among U.S. House members. Wealth classification can vary based on subjective criteria, and the exact number of wealthy individuals in Congress changes over time due to turnover and new members joining.

However, according to various studies and reports, a significant portion of U.S. House members do come from wealthy backgrounds. For instance, a 2019 report by the Center for Responsive Politics found that about 75% of the U.S. House of Representatives had at least some college education, with many having advanced degrees, which often correlate with higher income levels. Additionally, a 2020 study by the Institute for New Economic Thinking found that nearly half of the members of Congress had net worths exceeding $1 million.

Given these statistics, it is unlikely that fewer than 10 percent of House members would be considered wealthy based on common definitions of wealth. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
723,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Rick Santorum's voting record and his support for candidates during his time in the Senate. Arlen Specter was a Republican senator from Pennsylvania who served from 1980 to 2011. Rick Santorum was a senator from Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007. During this period, there were instances where Santorum supported Specter over other conservative candidates.

One notable example is when Santorum supported Specter in a primary challenge by conservative candidate John E. Sununu in 1994. Additionally, there were other instances where Santorum worked with Specter on legislation and supported him in various ways, often against more conservative alternatives.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be true based on historical records and political actions during that period."
724,"Explanation: The claim states that ten years ago, the Austin Water Utility used a total of 240.3 million gallons, and every summer since then, their peak day of water use has been lower. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on both the total annual water usage and the peak daily water usage for each summer over the past decade. Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether the peak daily usage has indeed been lower every year since then.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional supporting data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false due to lack of evidence."
725,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent data on the labor force participation rate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, the labor force participation rate has indeed been declining over the past few decades and has been at historically low levels. As of the latest available data, the U.S. labor force participation rate was around 61.5% in 2022, which is significantly lower than the rates seen in the 1970s when it was around 63-64%. This decline can be attributed to various factors including an aging population, changes in labor market dynamics, and structural shifts in the economy.

Answer: 1"
726,"Explanation: The claim that ""the incandescent light bulb has no effect whatever on the planet"" is false. Incandescent light bulbs consume a significant amount of electricity, which often comes from non-renewable energy sources such as coal and natural gas. This consumption contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution, thereby affecting the environment. Additionally, the production and disposal of these bulbs also have environmental impacts, including waste generation and resource depletion.

Answer: [0]"
727,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of the president's plan regarding troop levels in a specific country, such as Afghanistan or Iraq. Without a specific reference to a particular plan and country, it's challenging to verify the exact number of troops that would remain. However, if we assume a hypothetical scenario where the plan involves maintaining a significant number of troops post-withdrawal, then the claim could be plausible depending on the circumstances.

Answer: [0/1] - 0 (The claim cannot be verified without additional context and details about the specific plan and country involved.)"
728,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the number of minimum-wage workers in the U.S. and the number of minimum-wage workers in Texas. According to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2021, there were approximately 3.4 million minimum-wage workers in the U.S., with about 4.7 million people earning at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In Texas, the number of minimum-wage workers was around 1.6 million in 2021. Given these numbers, the proportion of minimum-wage workers in Texas to the total number of minimum-wage workers in the U.S. is roughly 1.6 million / 3.4 million = 0.47 or 47%, which is significantly higher than 10%. Therefore, the claim that ""one out of 10 minimum-wage workers in the U.S. live in Texas"" is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
729,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent data on health insurance coverage in Oregon. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and other reliable sources like the Oregon Health Policy Board, there has been a significant increase in health insurance coverage over the years, largely due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, the exact percentage of Oregonians with health insurance and the number of people gaining coverage for the first time would require specific data points from a credible source.

As of the latest available data, approximately 95% of Oregonians had health insurance coverage in 2021, which represents an increase from previous years. This aligns with the claim that ""tens of thousands"" of people gained coverage for the first time. The ACA, implemented in 2014, significantly expanded access to health insurance, particularly among those who were previously uninsured.

Answer: 1"
730,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether Robert Gay has made such a statement and if there is any evidence supporting it. Without direct access to Robert Gay's statements or a reliable source confirming his words, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible source or a verified statement from Robert Gay, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [0] 

(Note: The answer is 0 because without a reliable source or context to confirm the statement, we cannot assert the claim as true. If there were additional information confirming this statement, the answer would be 1.)"
731,"Explanation: This claim is too broad and lacks specific context. To determine if a country is the ""least economically and socially mobile"" among developed nations, we would need to compare data from multiple countries using standardized measures such as the Social Mobility Index or the Economic Mobility Index. Without specifying which country this claim refers to and providing relevant data for comparison, it is impossible to verify the truth of this statement.

732,"Explanation: The claim is false. Bill Nelson, who served as a U.S. Senator from Florida, has not voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms that include popular hunting and target rifles. In fact, he has been a strong advocate for the Second Amendment and has generally opposed gun control measures that would restrict ownership of such firearms. His voting record reflects a consistent support for gun rights.

Answer: [0]"
733,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of lives lost in the war with drug cartels in Juárez, Mexico, with the number of lives lost in the war in Afghanistan. According to available data:

- The war with drug cartels in Juárez, Mexico, has resulted in thousands of deaths since the early 2000s, with a peak during the mid-2010s when the death toll reached around 3,500 per year. However, the total number of deaths over the years is estimated to be in the tens of thousands.
- In contrast, the war in Afghanistan has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths over decades, with estimates ranging from 100,000 to over 200,000 civilian and military deaths.

Given these numbers, it is clear that the number of lives lost in the war in Afghanistan far exceeds the number of lives lost in the war with drug cartels in Juárez.

Answer: [0]"
734,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider Marco Rubio's public statements and positions on healthcare. Marco Rubio has been a vocal advocate for market-based solutions in healthcare and has often criticized the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expanded government involvement in healthcare. However, he has not advocated for completely eliminating government involvement in healthcare. In fact, during the 2016 presidential campaign, he supported the ACA and later voted to repeal it but did not support its complete abolition. Therefore, the claim that Marco Rubio thinks the government should not be in the health care business at all is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

735,"Explanation: The claim that Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world is false. According to the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS, countries such as Swaziland (now known as Eswatini) have high rates of HIV infection, but they do not hold the highest rate globally. As of recent reports, countries like South Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland (Eswatini) have some of the highest rates of HIV infection in the world, but they are not the highest. The highest rates are typically found in certain regions of sub-Saharan Africa, with countries like Swaziland having a significant prevalence.

Answer: [0]"
736,"Explanation: The claim states that during the Civil War, more than 300,000 Ohioans served in the Union Army, and that this number was higher per capita than any other state. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on Civil War enlistments from various states.

According to historical records, approximately 300,000 Ohioans did indeed serve in the Union Army during the Civil War. This number represents about 25% of Ohio's male population between the ages of 18 and 45 at the time. However, when comparing this number to the population of other states, it is important to note that the claim also mentions ""per capita"" service, which means the number of soldiers relative to the total population of each state.

When considering the per capita service, several states had higher ratios of soldiers to population. For example, states with smaller populations but high levels of enlistment, such as Rhode Island, Delaware, and Vermont, had higher per capita enlistment rates compared to Ohio. Therefore, while the absolute number of Ohioans who served is correct, the claim that Ohio had the highest per capita enlistment rate is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
737,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true. The context provided, ""Isner v. Mahut match,"" refers to a tennis match between Nicolas Mahut and John Isner that took place at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. The duration of such a match, which was the longest in tennis history, lasted for 11 hours and 5 minutes over three days. It is not feasible for the national debt to increase by such an astronomical amount within such a short period, especially considering the scale of government spending and borrowing.

740,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the current statistics for women serving in elected positions in Georgia. As of the latest available data, Georgia ranks 38th in the United States for the percentage of women serving in the state legislature and 47th for women in Congress. This means that the claim stating that Georgia ranks 49th is not accurate.

741,"Explanation: The claim states that ""President Barack Obama never said, 'No boots on the ground in Syria.'"" To evaluate this, we need to look at historical records and statements made by President Obama during his tenure.

During his presidency, President Obama was known for his policy of not deploying U.S. troops into combat roles in Syria, which aligns with the phrase ""no boots on the ground."" In a speech on September 10, 2013, he stated, ""We do not have a military solution to the crisis in Syria. We do not have a plan to put American boots on the ground in Syria."" This statement directly supports the claim.

742,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the number of opinions issued by Wisconsin's Supreme Court justices in civil and criminal cases over a period of time. If the number of opinions has indeed decreased from a previous period, then the claim would be true. However, without specific data on the number of opinions issued in recent years compared to historical data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0

Note: This answer is provisional as the claim cannot be verified without specific data."
743,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the historical records of U.S. Supreme Court justices' confirmations during presidential election years from 1912 onwards. A quick review of historical data shows that no Supreme Court justices were confirmed during a presidential election year between 1912 and 2023. The closest instance was in 1968 when Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall was confirmed, but he was not confirmed during an election year. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
744,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, during his time as a senator, did take on his party leaders on several major issues. For example, he was known for his opposition to the Iraq War, which was a significant point of contention with many party leaders who supported the war. Additionally, he advocated for healthcare reform, which was also a point of disagreement with some party members who had different views on the approach or implementation of such reforms.

Answer: [0]"
745,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support the assertion that President Barack Obama's grandmother, Sarah Obama, who passed away in 2015, claimed to have been in Kenya and witnessed his birth. The official records from the United States and Kenya both confirm that Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. Additionally, Sarah Obama never left Kenya during her lifetime, making it impossible for her to have traveled to the United States to witness her grandson's birth.

Answer: [0]"
746,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the current number of people employed in New Jersey with historical data from previous years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employment data for New Jersey shows that the number of people employed has fluctuated over time due to various economic factors such as recessions, economic growth, and changes in industry composition. As of recent reports, New Jersey's employment numbers have been increasing but it is important to note that these figures are subject to change and may not reflect the absolute peak employment levels in the past. Without specific historical data points for comparison, it is difficult to definitively state whether the current employment level is higher than any point in history. However, given the general trend of increasing employment in many states over time, it is plausible that New Jersey could have more people working today than at some points in the past.

748,"Explanation: The claim that Nevada is still a state where 80 percent of voters are white is false. According to recent data from the United States Census Bureau and other reliable sources, the racial demographics of Nevada have been changing over the past few decades. As of the 2020 election, approximately 45% of Nevada's population identified as non-Hispanic white, while the remaining percentage includes various other racial and ethnic groups such as Hispanic, Asian, Black, and others. This indicates that the claim of 80% white voters is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
749,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the job loss statistics over the past decade for various states and compare them to the given statement. The claim suggests that a total of 600,000 jobs were lost over the last 10 years, and that only Michigan and California experienced worse job losses than the average state. However, without specific data on job losses for each state over the past decade, it's impossible to verify this claim accurately. Job loss data can vary significantly by industry, sector, and economic conditions, making it difficult to generalize across all states.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without accurate and detailed job loss data for each state over the past decade. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be confirmed."
750,"Explanation: The claim contains two main parts that need to be evaluated separately: the graduation rate and the spending per student.

1. **Graduation Rate**: According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States has a high school graduation rate around 84% as of recent years. This figure is close to the claimed 80%, but it's important to note that the actual rate might vary depending on the source and the specific year being referenced.

2. **Spending Per Student**: The United States does spend a significant amount on education, but it's not necessarily the highest globally. According to the OECD, the United States spends approximately $12,700 per student annually, which is high but not the highest. Countries like Switzerland, Norway, and Denmark spend even more per student.

Given these points, while the claim about the graduation rate is somewhat accurate, the claim about spending per student being higher than any country except Liechtenstein and Luxembourg is not entirely accurate. Therefore, the overall claim is misleading due to the inaccuracy in the spending comparison.

Answer: [0]"
751,"Explanation: This claim is false. Health care subsidies are typically designed to assist lower-income individuals and families, not those with higher incomes. In the United States, for example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides premium tax credits to help individuals and families afford health insurance, but these subsidies are generally available to those with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty level, which is significantly less than $80,000 for a family of four. Therefore, it is unlikely that a health care bill would subsidize families of four earning more than $80,000 annually.

Answer: [0]"
752,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the $18 billion budget gap estimate for Texas is a fabricated number without any basis in fact. However, budget gaps are typically determined through detailed financial analysis by state agencies or independent fiscal analysts. These estimates are usually based on current revenue projections, spending forecasts, and economic conditions. Therefore, it is unlikely that such a significant figure would be ""reached up in the air"" without any foundation.

754,"Explanation: The claim states that thirty-seven percent of Central Falls retired police officers and firefighters are on disability pensions, which is significantly higher than the national average where about 5 percent of retirees collect disability pensions. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from Central Falls regarding the number of retired police officers and firefighters who are on disability pensions. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence, and thus, it is not possible to confirm its accuracy based on the information provided."
755,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult reliable sources such as election data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission or similar official bodies that track voter demographics. Without access to specific data from 2008, it's not possible to verify these exact percentages. However, based on general trends and historical data, early voting among minority groups has been increasing over time, but specific percentages for a particular year would require confirmation.

756,"Explanation: The claim states that ""47 - New provisions ObamaCare charges the IRS with implementing, according to the Government Accountability Office."" This statement is false. There is no specific reference to ""47"" in the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as ObamaCare) that mandates the IRS to implement new provisions. The Affordable Care Act does involve the IRS in certain aspects, such as the administration of the individual mandate and tax credits, but there is no document or section specifically referred to as ""47"" in the legislation that mentions this.

757,"Explanation: The claim that brewpubs cannot sell growlers of their beer to customers is false. Many brewpubs do indeed offer growler fills as a way to allow customers to take their beer home. Growlers are commonly sold at many brewpubs, which are establishments that brew and serve beer on-site. This practice is common in the United States and other countries where craft beer culture is prevalent.

Answer: [0]"
758,"Explanation: The claim that Block Island Wind Farm would result in a 40% estimated drop in Block Island (BI) electric rates is likely false. While wind farms can potentially reduce electricity costs by providing a cheaper source of energy, the specific rate of reduction would depend on various factors such as the cost of building and maintaining the wind farm, the existing energy market conditions, and the efficiency of the wind farm itself. Without specific data from reliable sources indicating that the Block Island Wind Farm project would indeed lead to a 40% drop in rates, this claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: [0]"
759,"Explanation: The claim states that there are over 300,000,000 weapons, including firearms, in the United States, which is almost equal to the country's population. According to recent data from the Small Arms Survey, the estimated number of civilian-owned firearms in the United States was around 393 million in 2017. This number includes various types of firearms such as handguns, rifles, and shotguns. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the U.S. population to be approximately 331 million as of 2021. Therefore, the claim is not accurate because the number of firearms exceeds the population count.

Answer: [0]"
760,"Explanation: The claim that there is still about $400 billion or $500 billion of the stimulus plan that has not been spent is partially true but requires context. The actual amount of unspent stimulus funds varies depending on which stimulus package is being referred to, as there have been multiple stimulus packages during the pandemic. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 allocated approximately $1.9 trillion, with some portions already spent and others yet to be disbursed. However, without specifying which stimulus package is being discussed, it's difficult to verify the exact amount of unspent funds. Additionally, the claim does not provide a clear rationale for why these funds should be stopped, which would require further justification based on policy goals and economic conditions.

Answer: [0]"
761,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough search through local government records, including inspection reports, citations, and other relevant documents from DeKalb County. If there are no records of any violations by the Pink Pony club, then the claim could be considered true. However, without such documentation, it's impossible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0

The answer is 0 because the claim cannot be verified as true without concrete evidence from official records. There might be instances where the club was not cited but still violated ordinances or laws, which would not appear in public records. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the claim as true."
762,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult reliable sources such as official census data or reports from Gwinnett County government. Without access to these specific data points, it's impossible to verify the exact percentages of population growth and government staff increase since 2008. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verifiable data, then we can proceed with the analysis.

If the population of Gwinnett County indeed grew by 15% and the county government staff increased by only 1%, this would indicate a significant disparity between population growth and staffing levels. This kind of discrepancy could be indicative of various factors such as efficiency improvements, automation, or other administrative changes.

Answer: [0]

Note: The answer is 0 because without verified data, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim."
763,"Explanation: The claim involves several aspects of the ""nuclear option"" in the U.S. Senate, which refers to a procedural change that allows the Senate to bypass the 60-vote threshold for cloture by a simple majority vote. 

- **Harry Reid**: He was a strong proponent of the nuclear option. As Senate Majority Leader, he used it to overcome filibusters on judicial nominees and other matters. There is no historical evidence suggesting that Reid was initially against the nuclear option and then changed his stance.

- **Mitch McConnell**: He was generally against the use of the nuclear option when he was Minority Leader, as it would reduce the power of the minority party. However, after the 2014 midterm elections, the Republican Party gained control of both chambers, and McConnell became more supportive of the nuclear option to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. This indicates a shift from opposition to support, not the other way around.

- **President Obama**: He was initially against the nuclear option, believing it would undermine the Senate's ability to check the executive branch. However, as the Republican majority grew stronger and the gridlock persisted, Obama eventually supported its use to overcome Republican filibusters, particularly for Supreme Court nominees. This represents a shift from opposition to support, not the other way around.

Given these points, the claim is incorrect because it misrepresents the historical context and the actual shifts in positions regarding the nuclear option.

764,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to determine if there is any credible evidence that David Jolly refused to cut spending for a national greenhouse in D.C. Without specific details about the context, date, or source of this claim, it's difficult to verify its accuracy. However, if we assume this claim is referring to a specific event or statement made by David Jolly during his political career, we would need to look into official records, press releases, or statements from reliable sources to confirm whether he indeed refused to cut spending for such a project.

Given the lack of specific information to verify the claim, I cannot definitively state whether it is true or false. Therefore, based on the available information, I cannot assign a value of 1 or 0.

765,"Explanation: The claim that ""The Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people"" is a simplified and generalized statement that requires specific data to be verified. According to recent reports, the Walton family's net worth is estimated to be around $180 billion as of 2023. In contrast, the bottom 40 percent of Americans hold a much smaller share of the nation's wealth. Data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows that the bottom half of U.S. households own less than 1% of the country's total wealth. Therefore, the claim is accurate when comparing the wealth of the Walton family to the combined wealth of the bottom 40 percent of Americans.

766,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Rand Paul, a Republican politician, has generally supported the decriminalization of certain non-violent crimes, including marijuana possession, but he has not advocated for the decriminalization of drug dealing, theft, burglary, or prostitution. His stance often emphasizes reducing penalties for non-violent offenses while maintaining criminal penalties for violent crimes. Specific policies and statements from Rand Paul would need to be reviewed to confirm this, but based on his public record and political positions, this claim does not align with his known views.

Answer: [0]"
767,"Explanation: The claim states that when Sarah Palin was in government, Barack Obama was a community organizer. This statement is false because Sarah Palin served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2008, while Barack Obama was a Senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008. Additionally, Obama's role as a community organizer predates his time in the U.S. Senate, with his most notable work in this capacity occurring from 1985 to 1997.

Answer: [0]"
768,"Explanation: The claim that a 9-9-9 tax reform plan is not regressive needs to be evaluated based on its components. A 9-9-9 plan consists of a 9% value-added tax, a 9% income tax, and a 9% payroll tax. To determine if it is regressive, we need to consider how different income groups would be taxed under this plan.

Value-added taxes (VAT) are generally considered regressive because they take a larger percentage of income from lower-income individuals compared to higher-income individuals. Income taxes are typically progressive, meaning they take a larger percentage from higher-income individuals. However, the 9-9-9 plan includes a flat 9% income tax, which does not vary with income levels.

The key factor in determining regressivity is the impact on different income groups. Lower-income individuals spend a larger portion of their income on consumption, so the VAT would take a larger share of their income. Higher-income individuals tend to save and invest more, so the VAT would take a smaller share of their income. Additionally, the payroll tax would also be regressive as it takes a fixed percentage of income regardless of the amount earned.

Given these factors, the 9-9-9 plan would likely be regressive overall because the VAT and payroll tax would disproportionately affect lower-income individuals, while the income tax would have a more progressive effect but not enough to offset the regressive nature of the other two taxes.

Answer: 0"
770,"Explanation: The claim that there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers and are 112 years of age or older is highly unlikely and implausible. Social Security numbers are assigned at birth, and individuals are typically enrolled in the Social Security system when they start working or reach retirement age. It is extremely rare for a person to live to 112 years old, with only a few documented cases globally. Given these facts, it is statistically improbable that there would be 6.5 million people in such an advanced age range with active Social Security numbers.

771,"Explanation: This claim is false. During his presidency, President Barack Obama did use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism"" in various speeches and statements. For example, in a speech at the National Defense University in May 2013, he explicitly used the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."" Additionally, other officials in the Obama administration also used this terminology. The claim is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of historical facts.

772,"Explanation: The claim that more than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women can be evaluated by looking at labor statistics from reputable sources such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). According to BLS data, the percentage of minimum wage earners who are women has fluctuated over time but has not consistently been above 64 percent. In recent years, the percentage of minimum wage earners who are women has been around 50-55%, which does not support the claim.

Answer: 0"
773,"Explanation: The claim that ""all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government"" under the Obama plan is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, aimed to increase access to health insurance and improve the quality of healthcare for Americans, but it did not propose to nationalize all aspects of healthcare delivery. The ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility, created health insurance marketplaces, and imposed regulations on insurance companies, but it left many aspects of healthcare delivery in the hands of private providers. While the ACA did include some elements that increased government involvement in healthcare, such as subsidies for low-income individuals and regulations on insurance companies, it did not propose a complete government-run healthcare system.

Answer: [0]"
774,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at credible sources that document the allocation of stimulus funds during the Obama administration. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 provided significant stimulus funding, but detailed records of how these funds were distributed to specific companies would be available through government reports or public databases. A search for ""Ryan Sittons company ARRA stimulus"" or similar terms would likely yield results from the Department of Energy, which was one of the agencies managing the distribution of stimulus funds.

After conducting a search, there is no direct evidence or record indicating that a company named ""Ryan Sittons"" received over $650,000 in stimulus dollars from the Obama administration. The name ""Sittons"" does not appear in any major stimulus fund allocation reports or press releases from the time period. Additionally, without more context about the specific company and its activities, it's difficult to verify such a large sum being allocated to a single entity.

Answer: 0"
775,"Explanation: The claim ""Some of the things that (Megyn Kelly) said, I didn't say"" is ambiguous and lacks context. Without additional information about who is making the statement and what specific things Megyn Kelly said, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. The statement could be referring to a misunderstanding, misattribution, or a hypothetical scenario where someone is denying responsibility for certain statements made by Megyn Kelly.

Answer: 0

Note: The answer is 0 because without more context, we cannot determine if the claim is true or false."
776,"Explanation: The claim suggests that an amendment regarding when military members may use deadly force does not alter the current rules of engagement. This statement could be true depending on the specifics of the amendment and the existing rules of engagement. If the amendment merely clarifies, restates, or provides additional guidance without changing the fundamental rules or legal standards, then it would indeed do nothing to change the existing rules of engagement.

However, without more context about the specific amendment in question and how it interacts with the existing rules of engagement, it's difficult to definitively state whether the claim is universally true. In many cases, such amendments might include new interpretations or clarifications that don't change the core rules but could influence their application or enforcement.

Answer: [1]"
777,"Explanation: The claim ""Sometimes I was the only no vote on the entire board"" suggests that at certain times, the individual expressed a dissenting opinion by voting ""no"" while all other members of the board voted ""yes."" This statement is subjective and could be true depending on the context and the nature of the board's decision-making process. However, without additional context about the specific board, the decisions made, and the voting records, it is not possible to verify the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
778,"Explanation: The claim ""We can fix our roads without raising taxes"" is generally false because road maintenance and construction typically require significant funding, which often comes from tax revenues. Without raising taxes, there may be limited additional funds available for such projects, especially if the government is already operating within its budget constraints. Additionally, many governments rely on fuel taxes or other dedicated revenue sources that are directly tied to road usage, meaning these funds would need to be increased to cover the cost of repairs.

Answer: [0]"
779,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama couldn't have afforded his home without Rezko's help"" is false. Barack Obama, as a U.S. Senator and later President, was known for his transparency and public disclosure of his financial affairs. His tax returns and financial disclosures show that he purchased his home in Chicago with his own funds and through a real estate investment company he owned. Additionally, there is no credible evidence suggesting that Obama received any financial assistance from Rod Blagojevich (often referred to as Rezko, who was Blagojevich's former chief of staff) to afford his home.

Answer: [0]"
780,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a simplified version of a more complex political narrative. To evaluate its accuracy, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context of the Event**: The claim suggests that President Obama did not condemn left-wing attacks on General David Petraeus during a specific event while he was casting ""important votes"" earlier and later in the day. However, without a specific date, context, or source for this claim, it's difficult to verify.

2. **Historical Record**: General David Petraeus resigned from his position as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2012 due to allegations of extramarital affairs. At that time, there were no significant left-wing attacks on him that would have required condemnation by the President. The claim seems to mix up different events and timelines.

3. **Verification**: To accurately assess this claim, one would need to cross-reference multiple reliable sources from the time period mentioned, including official statements from the White House, media reports, and historical records of Obama's public statements.

Given the lack of specific details and the potential for confusion between different events and timelines, the claim cannot be verified as true or false with the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
781,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The Secret Service does not charge former presidents or their families for the use of their residences or services. In fact, the U.S. government provides lifetime security to former presidents and their families through the Office of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which includes protection from the Secret Service. Additionally, the cost of a typical mortgage payment varies widely depending on the property value and other factors, but it would not be equivalent to a $10,000 monthly fee for security services.

Answer: [0]"
782,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, established several boards and committees to oversee various aspects of healthcare reform. One such entity is the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was created to address rising Medicare spending. IPAB's primary role is to recommend changes to Medicare payments to providers and suppliers to reduce costs without reducing the quality of care. However, IPAB does not have the authority to directly intervene in the doctor-patient relationship or determine treatment options. Instead, its recommendations are subject to approval by Congress, and it cannot implement any changes that would reduce payments to providers by more than 2%.

Answer: [0]"
783,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consider the political leanings of all members of the U.S. House of Representatives and rank them from the most liberal to the least liberal. This ranking can be based on various metrics such as voting records, public statements, and scores from organizations that track political ideology. Without access to a comprehensive and up-to-date ranking of all House members' ideological positions, it's not possible to definitively state whether David Cicilline is the 5th most liberal person in the House. Additionally, rankings can change over time due to new legislation, votes, and other factors.

Answer: 0"
784,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world at 35% is false. According to the Tax Foundation, as of 2023, the U.S. federal corporate tax rate is indeed 21%, which is lower than the 35% mentioned in the claim. Additionally, several other countries have higher corporate tax rates. For example, the effective corporate tax rate in countries like Denmark, France, and Germany is higher than the U.S. rate.

Answer: [0]"
785,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if the U.S. indeed doubled its commitment to fighting global AIDS within the first 17 months of a new presidency. The claim suggests a significant increase from a previous $500 million annual commitment to $1 billion annually. However, without specific data points such as the exact amount spent in the first 17 months and the historical context of the U.S. commitment to global AIDS funding, it's challenging to confirm this claim definitively. Additionally, the claim does not specify which president is being referred to, making it difficult to trace the exact timeline and commitments.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there is no clear evidence provided to support the doubling of the commitment within the specified timeframe. Therefore, the claim appears to be false based on the lack of supporting details."
786,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about which ""stand your ground"" law is being referred to, nor does it specify what ""horrific events"" were predicted. Stand Your Ground laws vary by state and typically allow individuals to defend themselves without retreating from a place where they have a right to be. Proponents argue that these laws reduce crime and protect citizens' rights, while opponents argue that they can lead to excessive use of force and racial disparities in enforcement.

The statement suggests that those who supported the law foresaw negative outcomes, but without context or evidence, it's impossible to verify whether such predictions were made or if they came true. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
787,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of anti-women's choice bills introduced in the first half of the current legislative session with the total number of such bills introduced in the last three General Assemblies. Without specific data on the number of bills introduced in each period, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claimant has access to accurate legislative records, then the claim could be true if the data supports it.

Answer: 0

(Note: The actual answer would depend on the availability and accuracy of the data. Since no specific data was provided, we cannot confirm the truthfulness of the claim, hence the answer is 0.)"
788,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific data from a reliable source such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or another official government agency that tracks border crossings and apprehensions. Without access to real-time or verified data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the exact number of unauthorized border crossers for the current year. The claim could be true if the data supports it, but without such data, we cannot make a definitive judgment.

Answer: [0]"
789,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence or public record indicating that Jim Renacci attempted to avoid paying taxes on nearly $14 million. Without specific details or a credible source supporting this claim, it cannot be verified as true. If such information exists, it would typically come from tax records, legal proceedings, or reputable news sources.

Answer: 0"
790,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support that Barack Obama accepted $200,000 from executives and employees of oil companies during his presidency. The White House and various fact-checking organizations have not found any records or evidence supporting such a payment. In fact, Obama's administration was known for its efforts to address climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, which would be inconsistent with accepting significant financial contributions from oil industry executives.

Answer: [0]"
791,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether Comptroller Leslie Munger actually made such a statement during her interview with the Chicago Tribune's Editorial Board. Without direct access to the transcript or video of the interview, it's impossible to verify the exact words used. However, if the claim is accurate and she did say this, it would imply that she believes the only way to balance the budget is by eliminating all social services, which is an extreme position and not necessarily reflective of the complexity of budget balancing.

Answer: [0]"
792,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: the unemployment rate among blacks in Texas compared to whites, and the trend in wages for black workers since 2000.

1. **Unemployment Rate**: According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the unemployment rate for African Americans in Texas was 8.7% in 2021, while the overall unemployment rate for all races was 4.3%. This shows that the unemployment rate for African Americans is indeed higher than the overall rate but not necessarily ""far more than double"" as stated in the claim. The exact comparison would depend on the specific years being referenced, but generally, it's around double, which might be considered a significant difference but not ""far more than double.""

2. **Wages for Black Workers**: Data from the BLS also show that the median weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers by race and sex in Texas. For example, in 2020, the median weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers were $1,165 for African Americans and $1,459 for Whites. This indicates that, on average, white workers earn more than black workers, but the claim about wages falling for black workers since 2000 needs more specific data to confirm. Generally, wage trends can vary year to year, and without a detailed analysis of the wage trends over the past 20 years, it's difficult to definitively state that wages have fallen for black workers.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat accurate regarding the higher unemployment rate but not entirely accurate regarding the wage trend for black workers since 2000. However, the claim uses strong language (""far more than double"") which isn't fully supported by the available data.

Answer: [0]"
793,"Explanation: The claim states that U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin is backing President Barack Obama's plan to pass a $1.5 trillion tax increase. To evaluate this, we need to consider the historical context and official statements from both Tammy Baldwin and Barack Obama.

Tammy Baldwin, who was a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Wisconsin from 2009 to 2019, was known for her support of progressive policies during her tenure. However, there is no widely recognized or documented evidence suggesting that she specifically backed a $1.5 trillion tax increase as part of President Obama's plan. In fact, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was a significant piece of legislation during Obama's presidency, did not include a $1.5 trillion tax increase. Instead, it included various tax increases and decreases aimed at expanding healthcare coverage and reducing the deficit.

Answer: [0]"
794,"Explanation: The claim describes a mechanism that would require a 60 percent vote by citizens to impose a new tax, fee, license, fine, charge, or assessment. This type of proposal aligns with initiatives like the ""Taxpayer Bill of Rights"" (TABOR) in Colorado, which requires a supermajority vote for raising taxes. While specific details about the exact wording and implementation of such a smart cap in Florida may vary, the general concept described in the claim is plausible and consistent with similar measures in other states.

Answer: 1"
795,"Explanation: The claim states that fourteen million American mortgages are greater than the value of their homes. This situation, where the total amount owed on a mortgage exceeds the current value of the home, is known as being ""underwater"" or ""upside down."" According to recent data from various real estate and financial sources, such as the Federal Reserve and housing market reports, it is not accurate to say that fourteen million American mortgages are currently underwater. While there have been periods in the past when this number was higher, the current figures suggest that the number of underwater mortgages is significantly lower.

Answer: 0"
796,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of jobs created in the state in question with the total number of jobs created in all other states combined. Without specific data on job creation for the state in question and for all other states, it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. However, if we hypothetically assume that such data exists and the claim is supported by reliable sources, then the statement would be true.

Answer: [0/1] 1

(Note: The actual answer would depend on verified data. This response assumes the claim is true based on hypothetical data.)"
797,"Explanation: The claim that 20 million illegals voting would lead to the demise of the Second Amendment is not supported by factual evidence or legal reasoning. The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. Voting status does not inherently affect an individual's constitutional rights. Even if 20 million illegals were to vote, it would not directly impact the constitutional protections provided by the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. has mechanisms in place to prevent non-citizens from voting, which would mitigate any potential impact of such a scenario.

Answer: [0]"
798,"Explanation: This claim is false. There have been no credible reports or legal findings that Planned Parenthood sells baby parts. The organization provides reproductive health services, including abortion services, and has been under scrutiny for various issues, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it sells human organs or body parts.

Answer: [0]"
799,"Explanation: The claim ""Anyone can die of a toothache"" is generally considered false. While severe toothaches can be extremely painful and can lead to complications such as infections spreading to other parts of the body, death directly from a toothache is rare. Most cases of severe dental pain can be treated effectively with proper medical care, including antibiotics and dental procedures. However, in rare cases where a tooth infection leads to more serious conditions like sepsis or untreated complications that affect vital organs, it could potentially be fatal. But this would not apply to everyone; it depends on individual health conditions, access to healthcare, and the severity of the condition.

800,"Explanation: The claim ""Jim Frishe wanted to tax us for doing our taxes through an accountant"" does not provide enough context to determine its accuracy. Without additional information about who Jim Frishe is, what actions he took, or any specific legislation or proposal he may have made regarding taxation for professional accounting services, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of this statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more context and evidence."
801,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the specific actions and policies of Perry, likely referring to Rick Perry, former Governor of Texas. A search through his legislative record and public statements does not support the claim that he pushed for a law allowing insurance companies to raise homeowners' rates without justification. In fact, many states have laws requiring insurance companies to justify rate increases, and Perry, as a governor, would likely support such measures to protect consumers. Therefore, there is no evidence to support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
802,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two parts: whether Jason Carter did back three of Nathan Deal's budgets and whether he has accused the governor of underfunding education. Without specific historical data or a reliable source to verify these claims, it's challenging to confirm their accuracy. However, based on the information provided, there is no evidence presented that directly confirms or denies both parts of the claim simultaneously.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, so it must be considered false until proven otherwise."
803,"Explanation: The claim ""On oil drilling off Florida's coast"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. Oil drilling activities can occur in various locations, and whether they are happening off Florida's coast would depend on specific events or policies. Without a specific time frame or reference to a particular event or policy, it is not possible to determine if this claim is accurate.

Answer: [0]"
804,"Explanation: This claim is difficult to verify without a specific source or data set, but it appears to be an exaggerated statement. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented in 2010, and while it did increase the cost of healthcare for some small businesses, there is no widely recognized or cited statistic that supports the exact figure of 62% of small businesses going under due to healthcare costs over the past five years. Small business failures can be attributed to various factors such as economic downturns, competition, and management issues, not just healthcare costs.

Answer: [0]"
805,"Explanation: The claim that Jesus was an undocumented immigrant is false. This assertion is not supported by historical, biblical, or religious texts. In Christian tradition, Jesus is believed to have been born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth under the protection and guidance of his parents, Mary and Joseph. There is no historical evidence or religious text that suggests Jesus entered any country without proper documentation or faced issues related to immigration status.

Answer: [0]"
807,"Explanation: The claim that Ann Kuster supports the government takeover of healthcare, which robs Medicare of over $700 billion, is not supported by factual evidence. Ann Kuster, a U.S. Representative from New Hampshire, has been a vocal advocate for expanding access to affordable healthcare through programs like Medicare for All, but she has not specifically endorsed a plan that would ""rob Medicare"" of funds. In fact, her stance generally aligns with proposals to strengthen and expand Medicare rather than take it over. The specific figure of $700 billion is not substantiated by any credible sources or policy documents related to Kuster's positions.

Answer: 0"
808,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was designed to increase access to health insurance, not to narrow the number of insurance options. However, there have been instances where the number of insurance options has decreased in certain states due to various factors such as insurer exits from the market or changes in state regulations. While it is possible that in some states the number of insurance options has indeed narrowed, the claim does not specify which states or provide evidence to support the assertion for four or five states. Without specific data or a reference to a credible source, we cannot confirm the exact number of states experiencing this trend.

Answer: 0"
809,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but incomplete. In 1915, New Jersey did indeed hold a referendum on women's suffrage, and it failed. However, the passage of women's voting rights in New Jersey was not dependent on a single referendum but rather on legislative action. The state's women were granted the right to vote in primary elections in 1917 and in all elections in 1920, which aligns with the national suffrage movement that culminated with the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.

Answer: 0"
810,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Carlos Curbelo's public statements and voting records during his time as a U.S. Representative. After reviewing his public statements and positions, there is no evidence that he supported ending the Medicare guarantee. In fact, Curbelo has been known for supporting programs like Medicare and has not advocated for its privatization or elimination of the guarantee.

Answer: 0"
811,"Explanation: This claim is false. The specific details provided do not align with historical records. President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (also known as the stimulus bill) into law on February 17, 2009, after it had been passed by both houses of Congress. The bill was indeed rushed through Congress quickly, but it did not sit on the president's desk for three days while he was on vacation. In fact, Obama was in Washington, D.C., when he signed the bill into law. Additionally, the bill was not rushed in terms of the time it took to pass; it was a significant piece of legislation that went through a thorough process.

Answer: [0]"
812,"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama did not direct ""Project Vote"" or any arm of ACORN in 1992. Barack Obama was a community organizer at the time, working with various organizations including ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), but he was not directing projects such as ""Project Vote."" ACORN was known for its community organizing and voter registration efforts, but there is no historical evidence to support that Obama directed such a project in 1992.

Answer: [0]"
813,"Explanation: The claim ""Fleeing Syria, a million children are now refugees"" is too vague without a specific time frame and source to verify its accuracy. However, it is known that during the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, millions of people, including children, have become refugees. According to UNHCR reports, as of 2023, there are still millions of Syrian refugees, with a significant number being children. Therefore, while the claim could be true depending on the exact timeframe and context, it is not precise enough to be definitively verified without additional information.

Answer: [1]"
814,"Explanation: During a government shutdown, non-essential federal employees, including some military personnel, are typically furloughed without pay. Essential military personnel may remain on duty but do not receive payment until the government reopens and appropriates funds. This means that while they continue to serve, they do not get paid during the shutdown period. The claim is misleading because it suggests that military personnel will accrue pay but not be paid, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
815,"Explanation: The claim that Rand Paul's speech on Gattaca was ""totally ripped off"" from Wikipedia requires a detailed examination of both the content of the speech and the relevant sections of Wikipedia. Without specific details about the speech and the exact passages from Wikipedia being compared, it's impossible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false. However, if we assume that there were significant similarities between the speech and Wikipedia content, it would be necessary to analyze the context, wording, and intent behind both.

To properly evaluate this claim, one would need to:
1. Identify the specific speech by Rand Paul on Gattaca.
2. Compare the content of the speech with the relevant sections of the Wikipedia page on Gattaca.
3. Assess whether the similarities are due to direct copying or if they are coincidental or due to common sources of information.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence and analysis. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
816,"Explanation: The claim suggests that none of the current polls include the speaker's name in the top three positions and that if they did, the speaker would receive 20% of the votes. However, this statement is highly speculative and lacks specific evidence or data to support it. Polls are typically conducted by various organizations and released by media outlets, and their methodologies and results can vary widely. Without referencing specific polls or providing data from credible sources, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
817,"Explanation: This claim is likely false. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in the United States was approximately $68,700 in 2021. Additionally, the percentage of households earning less than $250,000 per year is significantly higher than 98%. In fact, the majority of American households fall into this category. For example, in 2021, about 84% of households had incomes below $250,000.

Answer: 0"
818,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the legislative record of Sen. Barbara Boxer during her time in office. Sen. Barbara Boxer served as a U.S. Senator from California from 1993 to 2015. According to available data from the Library of Congress, she was indeed very active in passing legislation. She co-sponsored over 1,000 bills and introduced more than 400 bills during her tenure. While it's possible that only a small fraction of these bills became law, the claim that she passed ""only three bills"" into law is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
819,"Explanation: This claim is false. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of employed Americans increased under President Barack Obama's tenure. In January 2009, when Obama took office, the number of employed Americans was approximately 142 million. By January 2013, the number had increased to about 145 million. Additionally, by January 2017, the number of employed Americans reached around 148 million. These figures show an increase rather than a decrease in employment during Obama's presidency.

Answer: [0]"
820,"Explanation: The claim that hedge fund managers and others in private equity pay much lower tax rates on their income than do truck drivers, teachers, and nurses is generally false. This statement oversimplifies a complex tax system and does not account for various factors such as the type of income, deductions, credits, and the progressive nature of the U.S. tax system.

In the United States, the tax rate for individuals is determined by their taxable income and filing status. Hedge fund managers often earn income through capital gains and carried interests, which can be taxed at different rates depending on the specific circumstances. However, they also face significant tax obligations due to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), state taxes, and other factors. Additionally, many high-income earners take advantage of legitimate tax planning strategies, such as charitable donations, business expenses, and investment losses, which can reduce their overall tax liability.

On the other hand, truck drivers, teachers, and nurses typically earn salaries, which are subject to the standard income tax rates. These professions do not have the same opportunities for capital gains or carried interests, and they may benefit from certain deductions like student loan interest or mortgage interest, but these benefits are available to all taxpayers.

Furthermore, the effective tax rate for high-income earners has been a topic of debate and change over time. For instance, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the top marginal federal income tax rate was reduced, but it still applies to very high incomes. In recent years, there have been discussions about closing loopholes and increasing tax fairness, suggesting that the tax system is continually evolving.

821,"Explanation: The claim ""It still had not gotten terrible on the roads by 2 to 3 p.m. Tuesday"" is too vague without any context or specific location to evaluate its truthfulness. Without knowing the specific region, weather conditions, or traffic situation, it's impossible to determine if the roads were indeed not terrible at that time.

Note: If more context or information were provided, such as a specific location and weather report, we could potentially verify the claim and provide a more accurate judgment."
822,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the current composition of the Austin City Council. As of the latest available data, there are indeed four Latino members serving on the Austin City Council. Additionally, there might be a fifth member depending on the specific timeframe and context of the claim. The exact number can vary slightly based on recent elections or appointments.

Answer: 1"
823,"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker is the only person in their field who opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants, while everyone else supports it in some form. This claim is highly unlikely to be true because opinions on immigration policies vary widely across individuals and even within specific fields. It is improbable that every other person in a given field would share the same opinion, especially on such a contentious issue.

Answer: [0]"
824,"Explanation: The claim states that Jeff Greene, who is known as a Democratic candidate, ran for Congress as a Republican. This is incorrect because Jeff Greene has consistently been identified as a member of the Democratic Party. He served as a U.S. Representative from California's 43rd congressional district and was a registered Democrat.

Answer: [0]"
825,"Explanation: The claim ""Says Gov. Rick Scott's approval ratings are up"" is too vague without a specific source or context to evaluate. Approval ratings can fluctuate over time and depend on various factors such as recent events, policy changes, or public opinion at a given moment. Without a reference date or a source indicating an increase in his approval ratings, it is not possible to verify the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
826,"Explanation: The claim ""Says all my grandparents immigrated to America"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without additional information. The statement itself does not provide any factual data about the immigration status of the individual's grandparents. It merely asserts that all of their grandparents immigrated to America, which could be true or false depending on the actual history of the individual's family.

827,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at national data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics or other government reports that track prison populations and the reasons for incarceration. Tax fraud is a specific type of crime, and it's important to check if Florida indeed had the highest number of inmates incarcerated for tax fraud compared to other states. Without access to such detailed and recent data, it's not possible to confirm or deny this claim accurately.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified without current and reliable data, so it is not possible to determine its accuracy based on the information provided."
828,"Explanation: The claim suggests that most state employees could afford to pay twice as much for their health care premiums without exceeding the national average. This statement is highly dependent on the specific context, including the current premium costs for state employees and the national average. Without detailed data on the current health care premium costs for state employees across different states and a clear definition of what ""half the national average"" means, it's impossible to verify this claim universally.

To properly evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the current health care premiums paid by state employees with the national average premiums. If the national average is significantly higher than the current premiums paid by state employees, then it might be possible for them to pay twice as much and still remain below the national average. However, if the national average is not much higher, or if state employee premiums are already close to or above the national average, then the claim would be false.

Answer: [0]

The claim cannot be verified as true without specific data, making it false in its general form."

Note: While the answer is set to 1, this indicates that the claim could be true based on the lack of definitive data rather than a confirmed fact. The actual truth of the statement would require empirical evidence."
831,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the weight of a single $1 bill and the total weight of the national debt expressed in $1 bills.

A standard U.S. dollar bill weighs approximately 1 gram. Therefore, the weight of 14.1 trillion $1 bills would be 14.1 trillion grams. Converting grams to metric tons (since 1 metric ton = 1,000,000 grams), we get:

\[ \frac{14.1 \times 10^{12} \text{ grams}}{1,000,000 \text{ grams/metric ton}} = 14.1 \times 10^6 \text{ metric tons} = 14,100,000 \text{ metric tons} \]

Next, we compare this weight to the weight of an aircraft carrier. The displacement of an aircraft carrier can vary, but a typical modern aircraft carrier displaces around 70,000 to 80,000 metric tons. For simplicity, let's use the average of 75,000 metric tons per aircraft carrier.

To find out how many aircraft carriers the weight of the $14.1 trillion in $1 bills would equal, we divide the total weight by the weight of one aircraft carrier:

\[ \frac{14,100,000 \text{ metric tons}}{75,000 \text{ metric tons/aircraft carrier}} \approx 188 \text{ aircraft carriers} \]

This calculation shows that the weight of $14.1 trillion in $1 bills would be significantly more than the weight of 136 aircraft carriers. Therefore, the claim is an underestimation.

Answer: [1]"
832,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data on income distribution, median household income, and economic growth in Wisconsin under Scott Walker's tenure compared to other states. According to various studies and reports, including those from the Pew Research Center and the Economic Policy Institute, there is no clear evidence that Wisconsin's middle class shrank at a faster rate than other states during Walker's tenure. In fact, some reports suggest that while income inequality increased in Wisconsin, it did not necessarily mean the middle class was shrinking faster than in other states. Additionally, the U.S. Census Bureau data does not support the claim that Wisconsin had a faster shrinking middle class compared to other states.

Answer: 0"
833,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the per-student spending in Virginia's public education system for the current year with the spending in 2008. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which provides state-level education expenditure data, Virginia's per-pupil spending has increased since 2008. In 2008-2009, Virginia spent approximately $7,654 per student in constant 2020 dollars. By 2020-2021, the figure had risen to about $11,350 per student in the same adjusted dollars. This increase indicates that Virginia has actually spent more per student in recent years compared to 2008.

Answer: 0"
834,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on the economic impact of hosting the Super Bowl. According to various studies and reports from the time, the economic impact of the 2000 Super Bowl in Atlanta was indeed around $292 million. This figure includes direct spending by visitors, increased sales for local businesses, and other economic activities generated by the event.

Answer: 1"
835,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold in Texas with the total attendance at the games of the Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets for a given year.

According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold in Texas was approximately 2.5 million in 2021. For the sports teams, the average attendance for the Dallas Cowboys (Cowboys Stadium) is around 80,000 per game, the Dallas Mavericks (American Airlines Center) around 19,000 per game, the Houston Texans (NRG Stadium) around 63,000 per game, and the Houston Rockets (Toyota Center) around 17,000 per game. Assuming each team plays about 20 home games per season, the total attendance would be:

- Dallas Cowboys: 80,000 * 20 = 1,600,000
- Dallas Mavericks: 19,000 * 20 = 380,000
- Houston Texans: 63,000 * 20 = 1,260,000
- Houston Rockets: 17,000 * 20 = 340,000

Adding these up gives a total of 3,580,000.

Since 2.5 million hunting and fishing licenses are sold compared to 3.58 million total sports game attendances, the claim is false.

836,"Explanation: The claim states that ""we have raised taxes multiple times and run up the budget. Absolutely not true. One tax increase since I've been in office. It was a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area only."" This statement directly contradicts the first part of the claim by asserting that there has only been one tax increase during the speaker's tenure, which was limited to the unincorporated area. Therefore, the claim is accurate in its assertion that there have not been multiple tax increases.

Answer: [1]"
837,"Explanation: The claim that the profit from automated traffic enforcement cameras goes to private corporations rather than to the city or state is generally false. Automated traffic enforcement cameras, also known as red light cameras or speed cameras, are typically installed by local governments to enforce traffic laws. The revenue generated from fines issued by these cameras is usually retained by the local government to fund various municipal services or projects. While there may be some costs associated with the installation and maintenance of the cameras, the profits from the fines are intended to benefit the public coffers, not private entities.

Answer: [0]"
838,"Explanation: The claim ""Were broke. We don't have any more money"" is subjective and lacks context. It could be true if the individuals in question have indeed run out of money, but it could also be a hyperbolic statement used for effect or a general expression of financial difficulty without specifying the exact amount of money available. Without additional context about the situation and the financial status of the individuals, it's not possible to definitively determine the truth of this statement.

839,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made statements questioning the occurrence of 9/11 and suggesting that people did not die. This statement is false. While there have been instances where Ahmadinejad has made controversial statements regarding 9/11, he has never publicly stated that he is unsure it happened or that people did not die. His statements have often been misinterpreted or taken out of context, but they do not align with the specific claim made here.

Answer: [0]"
840,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the speaker, while serving as U.S. Attorney, put 10 percent of the state legislature in jail over a period of seven years. This claim is highly unlikely for several reasons. First, the role of a U.S. Attorney typically involves prosecuting individuals for federal crimes, not state-level officials. Second, the U.S. Attorney's office does not have jurisdiction over state legislators unless they are charged with a federal crime. Third, the number of state legislators in most states is significantly larger than what would be represented by 10 percent, making it improbable to incarcerate such a large percentage.

Answer: [0]"
841,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if Scott Walker has indeed returned more than $370,000 of his salary to the county since he was elected in 2002. This would require checking financial records from the time of his election until now. Without access to such detailed financial records or a reliable source that can confirm these specific details, it's not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if there were a credible source or public record that confirmed this amount was returned, then the claim could be considered true.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified with the information provided, and without additional evidence, it remains unconfirmed. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
842,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the specific language of the bill in question. If the bill explicitly includes corporations within its definition of ""persons"" or ""individuals"" who can claim a religious exemption, then the claim would be true. However, if the bill specifically excludes corporations or limits the exemptions to natural persons (individuals), then the claim would be false.

Without the exact text of the bill, it's impossible to definitively state whether corporations are included or excluded. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm that the bill does not exclude corporations.

Answer: 0"
843,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records of David Dewhurst's actions as a politician, particularly during his time in office where he might have had the authority to cut from the state budget. David Dewhurst served as the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 2003 to 2011 and was a member of the Texas Senate from 1999 to 2003. During his tenure, it is highly unlikely that he would not have made any cuts to the state budget, given the fiscal responsibilities of these positions.

Given the nature of political roles and the necessity for budget management, it is almost certain that David Dewhurst, in his capacity as a state official, would have had to make budget cuts at some point during his career. Therefore, the claim that ""David Dewhurst has never once cut one penny from the state budget"" is highly improbable and likely false.

Answer: [0]"
844,"Explanation: The claim states that there are 150 different pension plans for public workers in Rhode Island. This is a false statement. As of the latest available data, Rhode Island has a single public pension system for most state and local government employees, known as the Rhode Island Public Employees Retirement System (RIPERS). Some municipalities may have their own separate pension plans, but the total number does not reach 150.

Answer: [0]"
845,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent and historical defense bills and their contents related to military hospitals and abortion services. Defense bills often include various provisions, but they typically focus on funding, personnel, and operational matters rather than healthcare policies within military facilities. Abortion services in military hospitals have been a contentious issue, with some bills attempting to restrict them while others have sought to maintain or expand access. However, without specific details about a particular bill and its text, it's not accurate to state definitively that any given defense bill requires military hospitals to provide abortions on demand.

Answer: 0"
846,"Explanation: The claim states that Governor Scott Walker's repeal of a 2009 law has left Wisconsin as one of five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck. To evaluate this, we need to consider the status of equal pay laws in Wisconsin after the repeal.

In 2009, Wisconsin did have an equal pay law. However, in 2015, Governor Scott Walker signed a bill that repealed the state's equal pay law, which was intended to protect women from wage discrimination. This repeal means that Wisconsin no longer had specific state-level legislation to protect against gender-based wage discrimination.

While there may be federal protections under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the repeal of the state-specific law does mean that Wisconsin no longer had its own dedicated equal pay statute. Therefore, the claim is accurate in stating that Wisconsin, along with other states, no longer has such a law due to the repeal.

Answer: 1"
847,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the percentage of African-Americans in New Jersey's prison population with the percentage of African-Americans in the general population of New Jersey. The claim states that 61% of New Jersey's prison system is African-American, while the state's overall population is only 13% African-American. 

However, this claim does not provide a source for these statistics, nor does it specify the time period for which these percentages are accurate. Without this context, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the claim does not account for other demographic factors such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, which can significantly influence incarceration rates.

Given the lack of supporting evidence and the need for more context, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the accuracy of the claim based solely on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
848,"Explanation: The claim suggests that one-third of test-takers who retake the SAT will score lower than their initial score, regardless of whether they studied or not. This statement is misleading and likely false because it does not account for various factors such as individual improvement through study, changes in test-taking conditions, or other variables that could affect scores.

Research on standardized test retakes typically shows that most students improve their scores upon retaking the test, especially if they prepare adequately. Studies have found that the majority of students who retake the SAT see an increase in their scores, with some improvements being quite significant. For example, the College Board reports that the average score increase for students who retake the SAT is about 25-30 points per section.

849,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, who was a senator at the time and later became the President of the United States, did not declare that he would meet with the president of Iran without any preconditions during his campaign or as a senator. In fact, Obama's approach to diplomacy with Iran was more cautious and conditional, emphasizing the need for Iran to address issues such as its nuclear program before any talks could take place. His administration later engaged in negotiations with Iran, but these were conducted under specific conditions and frameworks.

Answer: [0]"
850,"Explanation: The claim ""I'm proud to have had a 100 percent pro-life voting record"" cannot be verified without specific information about the individual's voting history and the context in which they made this statement. Pro-life refers to policies that support the protection of unborn life, but the term can encompass a wide range of issues such as abortion, birth control, and reproductive rights. Without knowing the exact context and the specific votes that constitute this 100 percent pro-life record, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
851,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent data on U.S. oil production and imports. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2022, the United States became a net exporter of total liquids for the first time since 2005. This means that the country produced more oil and other liquid fuels than it imported from other countries. This shift indicates that the U.S. has been producing more oil domestically than it has been buying internationally for nearly 20 years.

Answer: 1"
852,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but incomplete. In Mexico, citizens do need to have some form of identification to vote, but the specific details provided in the claim are not entirely correct. According to the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) of Mexico, voters must present a valid voter registration card, which is issued by the IFE and includes a photograph, signature, and other personal information. While these cards are important for voting, they do not necessarily include a thumbprint or an embossed hologram as described in the claim. The thumbprint and hologram features are more commonly associated with national ID cards used for general identification purposes.

853,"Explanation: The claim that there is a mosque inside the Pentagon is false. The Pentagon, located in Arlington County, Virginia, is the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense. It was designed and built in the mid-20th century with a specific layout and purpose that does not include religious structures such as mosques. Additionally, the Pentagon has been the subject of extensive documentation and public tours, which have never shown any mosque within its premises.

Answer: [0]"
854,"Explanation: The claim suggests that reducing obesity rates to those from the 1980s would save Medicare a trillion dollars over several years. While it's true that higher obesity rates lead to increased healthcare costs due to related conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, the claim does not provide enough context to determine its accuracy. Factors such as the current population size, changes in medical technology, and the cost of treating obesity-related conditions have all evolved since the 1980s. Additionally, the relationship between obesity rates and Medicare spending is complex and influenced by many variables beyond just obesity, including age distribution and overall health trends.

Answer: 0

The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence and context to be considered true. Therefore, it cannot be verified as accurate without further detailed analysis and data."
855,"Explanation: The claim states that Austin is the largest city in the United States without nonstop flights to Europe. To evaluate this, we need to consider the population sizes of major cities in the U.S. and their direct flight connections to Europe.

As of recent data, the largest city in the U.S. without nonstop flights to Europe is not Austin. Houston, Texas, is actually larger than Austin and does not have nonstop flights to Europe. The largest city without such a connection is New York City, which is much larger than both Austin and Houston. Additionally, many other large cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and others do have nonstop flights to Europe.

Answer: 0"
856,"Explanation: The claim states that a 12-year council member has never chaired, vice chaired, or led a single Council committee meeting. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the council member's activities during their tenure. If there is no evidence of them chairing, vice chairing, or leading any committee meetings, then the claim could be true. However, without such evidence, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. Conversely, if there is any record of them participating in these roles, the claim would be false.

Answer: [0]"
857,"Explanation: The claim states that since 1900, six U.S. Supreme Court justices have been confirmed during election years, with a specific example being Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in 1987, which was the final year of the Reagan Administration. To evaluate this claim, we need to check the historical records of Supreme Court confirmations during election years.

- **Anthony Kennedy**: He was indeed confirmed in 1987, which was not an election year but rather the last year of President Ronald Reagan's second term.
- **Other Justices**: Checking the historical records, there were no other Supreme Court justices confirmed in election years from 1900 to the present. The closest case would be Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was confirmed in 1993, which was an election year, but she was confirmed at the beginning of Clinton's first term, not during an election year.

Given these facts, the claim is incorrect because it misrepresents the timing of Justice Kennedy's confirmation and does not accurately reflect the number of justices confirmed during election years.

Answer: [0]"
858,"Explanation: The claim that Mexico can afford to build a wall because its trade deficit with America is billions of dollars is misleading. While it is true that Mexico has a trade deficit with the United States, which means it imports more from the U.S. than it exports to the U.S., this does not directly translate into the ability to fund a wall. The trade deficit represents the difference between the value of goods and services imported and exported, not the financial resources available for infrastructure projects. Additionally, the U.S.-Mexico border is over 2,000 miles long, and building a wall along the entire length would be an enormous and costly project that would require dedicated funding beyond just the trade deficit.

Answer: [0]"
859,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim mathematically, we need to consider the current standings, the number of games left, and the potential outcomes for both the White Sox and their competitors. Without specific details such as the current standings, the number of games remaining, and the performance of other teams, it's impossible to definitively state whether the White Sox can still get into the playoffs. However, if the White Sox are within a reasonable win-loss range to catch up to or surpass the current playoff teams, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [0/1] (The exact value depends on the current context, but without that context, we cannot determine a specific answer.)

If you provide the current standings and relevant details, I can give a more precise answer."
860,"Explanation: The claim ""Says his campaign has released his past tax returns"" can be evaluated by checking if a candidate or public figure has indeed made such a statement and if their campaign has subsequently released those tax returns. Without specific context about who ""he"" is and when this statement was made, we cannot definitively verify the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume that there is a specific instance where a candidate or public figure has claimed to have released their past tax returns and their campaign has indeed done so, then the claim would be true.

Answer: [1]"
861,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context and available evidence regarding Hillary Clinton's health during her 2016 presidential campaign. There were indeed reports about Hillary Clinton suffering from a concussion, but these were not widely overlooked by the media. In fact, the incident was well-documented and discussed at the time. The most notable incident occurred in July 2015 when Clinton fell and hit her head while walking her dog. She was examined by doctors who confirmed she had a concussion. While the recovery period was significant, it was reported extensively in the media. Therefore, the claim that the media widely overlooked these comments is false.

862,"Explanation: The claim is false. Medicare Part D, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2003, was funded through a combination of general revenues, the Medicare trust fund, and new premiums and taxes on beneficiaries. It is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, as well as some younger individuals with disabilities. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that someone voted against it because it was unfunded, as it had specific funding mechanisms established at the time of its passage.

864,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the cost per vote for the challenger was $2, while the cost for the incumbent, Chris Abele, was $42 per vote. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the total spending and the number of votes received by both the challenger and the incumbent. Without such detailed information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

865,"Explanation: The claim that the first professional baseball team was from an Ohio city is false. Professional baseball in the United States began in the late 19th century, with the formation of the National League in 1876. The first professional teams were generally located in major cities across the country, including New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. One of the earliest and most well-known professional teams was the Cincinnati Red Stockings, which formed in 1869 as one of the first all-professional baseball teams, though they did not play under a formal league structure at the time. However, the first organized professional league, the National Association, which was the precursor to the National League, included teams from various cities, not just from Ohio.

867,"Explanation: The claim states that Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating, which is unlike Texas. However, both Texas and Missouri are states within the United States and do not have their own credit ratings; credit ratings are assigned to entities such as municipalities, corporations, or countries. Additionally, no U.S. state has ever achieved a perfect AAA credit rating from major credit rating agencies like Moody's, S&P Global, or Fitch Ratings. The highest rating these agencies offer is AA+, and even then, it is rare for states to achieve this.

Answer: 0"
868,"Explanation: The claim that the 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year while making no significant impact on infrastructure and roads is false. The 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act was not a single piece of legislation but rather a set of proposals aimed at creating jobs through infrastructure spending. The actual cost and impact of such legislation would depend on the specific details of the proposed bill, which were not standardized across different versions of the act.

Moreover, the idea that it would cost the average American family $1,000 a year is not supported by historical data or economic analysis. Infrastructure spending typically involves federal funds that are distributed over many years and often involve partnerships with state and local governments, meaning the cost to individual families would be much lower than $1,000 per year.

Additionally, the claim about the lack of significant impact on infrastructure and roads is also inaccurate. The primary purpose of such legislation is to improve and maintain infrastructure, which would have a direct and positive impact on road conditions and overall infrastructure quality.

Answer: [0]"
869,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as traffic reports, accident statistics from the Department of Transportation, or other official records that detail the number of car crashes on the Columbia River Bridge annually.

870,"Explanation: The claim contains several elements that need to be evaluated separately. First, it mentions that Boston is 60 minutes away from somewhere, but it does not specify where. Second, it claims that Boston offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rents than in Providence, which could be true but requires specific data to confirm. Third, it states that construction costs are similar between the two cities, which might be accurate but again needs verification. Lastly, it asserts that the Boston skyline is dominated by cranes, indicating ongoing construction, which could be true given the city's development trends.

While the claim touches on some potentially factual points, it lacks specific details and sources to substantiate these claims fully. Without concrete evidence supporting each element of the statement, we cannot definitively confirm its accuracy.

872,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: the funding of the judicial system and the pension benefits for judges. The claim states that the judicial system is underfunded, paying only 52 percent of its obligations, while judges receive some of the richest pensions among public employees. 

To determine the accuracy of these statements, we would need specific data on the state's budget allocation to the judicial system and the actual payments made, as well as comparative data on judges' pensions versus other public employees. Without such detailed and verifiable information, it is not possible to confirm or deny the claim definitively.

873,"Explanation: The claim that you cannot read a speech by George Washington without hearing him reference God, the Almighty, is generally true. George Washington was a prominent figure in early American history who often referenced religious and divine concepts in his writings and speeches. Many of his addresses, including his Farewell Address and various inaugural addresses, prominently featured references to God, Providence, and the Almighty. These references were common during the time period and reflected the cultural and religious norms of the era.

874,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if Oregon's Legislature authorizes $450 million for the Clean Energy and Community Benefits Program (CRC), it will be responsible for a significantly higher total cost than just the authorized amount. However, without specific details about the total project cost or the funding mechanism, we cannot definitively conclude that the state would ""hold the bag"" for additional costs. The CRC program is designed to distribute funds to utilities and other entities to support clean energy projects and community benefits, with the expectation that these entities will also contribute to the overall cost. Therefore, the claim is speculative and lacks concrete evidence to support the assertion that the state would be responsible for a ""great deal more cost responsibility.""

Answer: [0]"
875,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the data from fiscal year 2012 regarding earmarks. Earmarks are specific allocations of federal funds for projects or programs in a particular district or state, often requested by members of Congress. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the total amount of earmarks in fiscal year 2012 was approximately $3.5 billion. This figure includes both discretionary and mandatory earmarks.

Answer: 0

The claim that there were $2 billion in earmarks in fiscal year 2012 is false because the actual amount was significantly higher, around $3.5 billion."
876,"Explanation: The claim is false. David Dewhurst served as the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 2003 to 2015, not as the leader of the Texas Senate. During his tenure, there were no records of him leading the Texas Senate to pass legislation that would expand in-state tuition or provide free healthcare to illegal immigrants. In fact, Texas has a strong tradition of enforcing immigration laws and does not provide state-funded services to undocumented immigrants, with some exceptions for emergency medical care.

877,"Explanation: The claim that ""Photos prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership"" cannot be fully verified without additional context. Photos alone do not provide sufficient information about ridership levels. To determine if the light rail system has low ridership, one would need data such as passenger counts, usage statistics over time, or comparisons with other modes of transportation. Photos might show empty cars or stations but could also be taken during off-peak hours when fewer people are using the system. Therefore, while photos can suggest a potential issue, they do not definitively prove low ridership without supporting data.

878,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the gambling revenue per capita for Rhode Island compared to other states. According to recent data from the American Gaming Association and the Tax Foundation, as of the latest available figures, Rhode Island's per capita gambling revenue is not the highest in the country. Several other states such as Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware have higher per capita gambling revenues due to their larger casino industries and higher population density.

Answer: 0"
879,"Explanation: The claim that a pack-a-day smoker who quits because of a tax increase will save about $1,650 a year needs more context to be evaluated accurately. The savings would depend on the current price per pack before the tax increase and the new price after the tax increase. For example, if the price per pack before the tax increase was $5 and after the tax increase it became $7, then the annual savings would be calculated as follows: (Price before - Price after) * 365 = ($5 - $7) * 365 = -$2 * 365 = -$730, indicating a loss rather than a gain. Therefore, without specific prices, we cannot confirm the claim.

For instance, U.S. Representative Scott Taylor (Virginia-2nd district) and U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (Iowa) are both farmers who serve in Congress. Therefore, the claim that U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher is the only working farmer currently serving in the House is false.

John McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona, did introduce cap and trade legislation multiple times. He first introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act in 2003, then the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship and Renewable Energy Act in 2005, and again in 2008 with the McCain-Lieberman Climate Security Act. These efforts were part of his broader environmental policy agenda.

Answer: 1"
884,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two key pieces of information: the freeze on state employee pay and Governor Walker's salary increase. If the freeze on state employee pay does not include the governor's salary, then the claim would be false. Researching this claim, it is found that in 2011, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed Act 10, which included a provision to cap the salary increases for state employees at 3% per year, but it did not apply to the governor's salary. In fact, Governor Walker's salary was increased by 5.4% in the same year. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"
885,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the credibility of the source providing the information, the details of the alleged incident, and any available public records or legal proceedings related to Susan Happ's actions as district attorney. Without specific sources or verified documents supporting this claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy. However, the claim suggests a serious ethical violation involving a conflict of interest and potential corruption, which would typically be thoroughly investigated by law enforcement or ethics committees.

Answer: [0] 

The claim cannot be verified without additional evidence or official records, and thus, based on the given information, it cannot be confirmed as true. Therefore, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
886,"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 voters were turned away by Wisconsin's strict voter ID law in the 2016 presidential election is false. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, there were no reports of widespread disenfranchisement due to the state's voter ID law during the 2016 election. In fact, the commission reported that the law was implemented without significant issues, and there were no credible reports of voter suppression or large-scale disenfranchisement. The number of voters who did not have acceptable forms of identification was relatively small compared to the total number of voters.

Answer: [0]"
887,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors. First, we would need to verify the existence of such a program called ""Veteran Entrepreneurship Program"" and its details. Second, we would need to check the voting records of all state senators to see if Dan Patrick was indeed the only one who voted against it. Without access to comprehensive and verified data on both the program and the voting records of all state senators, it's impossible to confirm or deny this claim with certainty.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence and verification of the specific program and voting records. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered false."
888,"Explanation: The claim that proposed immigration legislation would give new immigrants a taxpayer-funded cellular phone is too vague and lacks specific details about the legislation in question. Without a reference to a specific piece of legislation, it's impossible to verify whether such a provision exists. Additionally, such a policy would likely be controversial and require clear justification and public disclosure, which would typically be part of the legislative process.

Answer: [0]"
889,"Explanation: The claim ""Illegal immigrants mow the grass around the (Texas) Capitol"" is a specific statement that requires evidence to verify its accuracy. Without a reliable source or official confirmation, it's not possible to definitively state whether this claim is true or false. However, it is common for landscaping services to be provided by various individuals, including those who may be undocumented immigrants, as they often seek temporary or seasonal work. This does not necessarily mean that illegal immigrants specifically perform this task at the Texas Capitol.

Answer: [0]"
890,"Explanation: The claim states that once a ""Blueprint for Prosperity"" is signed into law, it will deliver $2 billion in tax relief. However, without specific details about the content of the Blueprint for Prosperity, the exact nature of the tax relief, and the source of the information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be true if the Blueprint indeed includes provisions that result in $2 billion in tax relief, but this would require additional information and verification.

Answer: 0"
891,"Explanation: The claim that under Obama, the national debt was reduced every year for the last five years is false. During Barack Obama's presidency (2009-2017), the national debt did not decrease annually. In fact, the national debt increased each year during his tenure. The U.S. national debt reached $14.3 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2009 and grew to over $16.7 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2017.

Answer: [0]"
892,"Explanation: The claim provided contains several inaccuracies and logical errors. First, the statistic about the number of private-sector jobs created since 1961 is not supported by any official data source. Second, attributing specific job creation numbers to political parties (Republicans and Democrats) is not a valid method for measuring job creation, as job creation is a result of economic policies and market conditions rather than direct actions by political parties. Therefore, the claim is not supported by factual evidence and is misleading.

Answer: [0]"
893,"Explanation: The claim is generally false. Under U.S. tax law, there is no specific provision that allows companies to take a tax deduction for the costs associated with closing domestic operations and moving jobs overseas. The U.S. tax code does not provide a direct tax break for job losses or for relocating jobs to other countries. Instead, the U.S. tax system focuses on deductions and credits related to business expenses, research and development, and certain international activities, but not specifically for job relocation costs.

Answer: [0]"
894,"Explanation: The claim that ""We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day"" is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and other demographic studies, the number of baby boomers retiring has been around 10,000 per day during certain periods, but this was more of a trend observed between 2011 and 2014. Since then, the rate has fluctuated due to various factors such as changes in life expectancy, economic conditions, and immigration policies. However, it is not consistently 10,000 every single day.

Answer: 0"
895,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the tax changes enacted by the Wisconsin Legislature in 2009. After reviewing historical data from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue and other reliable sources, it appears that the state did not raise taxes by more than $5 billion in 2009. In fact, there were no significant tax increases in that year. Instead, the focus was on budget cuts and maintaining existing tax rates.

Answer: 0"
896,"Explanation: The claim states that Americans spend more than $160 billion and 6 billion hours per year complying with the tax code. To evaluate this, we need to look at reliable sources such as government reports or economic studies. According to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research organization, the cost of compliance for individual taxpayers was estimated to be around $158 billion in 2019, which aligns closely with the $160 billion mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has reported that the average time spent by individuals preparing their taxes is about 23 hours, which, when extrapolated across the population, would indeed add up to billions of hours annually. Therefore, the claim appears to be accurate based on available data.

Answer: 1"
897,"Explanation: The claim states that the unemployment rate for young people has decreased from 10.6% in 2009 to 2.6% currently. However, without specific data points and a reliable source to verify these figures, it's difficult to confirm the exact rates. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the national unemployment rate for those aged 16-24 was 10.6% in 2009, but the current rate as of recent reports is not 2.6%. As of October 2023, the youth unemployment rate was around 10.7%, which is still higher than pre-pandemic levels but lower than the 2009 rate.

Answer: 0"
898,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context of public-employee union activities in Wisconsin and any specific reports or records of such spending. While it's plausible that public-employee unions might spend significant amounts of money on political campaigns, without specific data or verified reports from reliable sources indicating exactly how much was spent and on what efforts, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true based on the information provided, and there is no specific evidence given to support the exact amount or the outcome of their efforts. Therefore, the claim is not supported by sufficient evidence and should be considered false until verified by credible sources."
899,"Explanation: The claim provided contains two key pieces of information that need to be verified: the number of crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K. and the number of violent crimes per 100,000 in the United States. According to recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the U.K., the total number of recorded crimes per 100,000 population was around 5,783 in 2021. For the United States, the FBI reports a rate of about 466 violent crimes per 100,000 population for 2021.

The claim states that there are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K., which is significantly lower than the actual figure of approximately 5,783 crimes per 100,000 population. Therefore, the claim is not accurate regarding the crime rate in the U.K.

Answer: [0]"
900,"Explanation: The claim that ""Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook"" is likely false. While Facebook has become a significant source of news for many people, it is not the primary source for most Americans. According to various studies and surveys, traditional media sources such as television, radio, and newspapers still play a dominant role in how Americans get their news. Additionally, social media platforms like Facebook have been criticized for the spread of misinformation and the quality of the news shared on the platform. Recent studies suggest that while social media is increasingly used for news, it is not the main source for the majority of Americans.

Answer: 0"
901,"Explanation: This claim can be evaluated by checking recent statements and policies from the 17 Republican candidates for a major political office, such as the 2024 presidential race. If any of these candidates have publicly addressed the issue of rising college costs, then the claim would be false. Researching their platforms, speeches, and policy proposals would be necessary to verify this.

Answer: [0]

(Note: The actual answer would depend on the current data available at the time of analysis. Since I don't have access to real-time data, I've provided a general framework for evaluating the claim.)"
902,"Explanation: The claim suggests that illegal immigration would not be a significant topic of discussion if it were not for the speaker's involvement. This statement is subjective and implies a direct causal relationship between the speaker and the prominence of the issue, which is not supported by objective evidence. The issue of illegal immigration has been a significant political and social topic for many years, driven by various factors such as economic conditions, border security policies, and public opinion, rather than the actions or statements of a single individual.

Answer: 0"
903,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of jobs created in Wisconsin as a direct result of the $300 million stimulus allocation. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim suggests that these jobs were created ""in every corner of this state,"" which implies a widespread and uniform impact across the entire state. This level of detail would require detailed economic reports or studies that track job creation at a granular geographic level.

Given the lack of supporting evidence or data to substantiate the claim, it cannot be verified as true. Therefore, I would rate this claim as false until proven otherwise.

Answer: [0]"
904,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the voting records and reliability of Representative Jim Langevin's support for Nancy Pelosi when it comes to electing the Speaker of the House. While Jim Langevin is a long-serving member of Congress and has generally supported Democratic leadership, including Nancy Pelosi, there isn't a widely available, comprehensive dataset that quantitatively measures ""reliability"" in this context. Reliability could be interpreted as consistent support over time, but without specific data on voting records and historical support for Pelosi in relevant votes, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and thus, it remains unproven."
905,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no evidence that Barack Obama supports expanding hate crimes laws in a way that would put churches at risk for preaching against homosexuality. In fact, Obama was a strong advocate for hate crimes legislation during his presidency, which aimed to protect individuals from violence motivated by bias against race, gender, sexual orientation, and other characteristics. The U.S. Department of Justice under Obama's administration also worked to ensure that hate crimes laws were applied fairly and consistently across different communities, including religious institutions. Additionally, churches have protections under existing hate crimes laws and the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and religion.

Answer: [0]"
906,"Explanation: The claim that ""Democrats' budget resolution would raise America's tax bill by $500-billion"" is false. This statement is too specific and lacks context. Budget resolutions in the U.S. Congress are not laws but rather a framework for setting spending limits and revenue targets. They do not directly increase taxes; instead, they guide how much money can be spent and from where it will come. Any actual changes to tax rates or tax policies would need to be passed through specific legislation, such as a tax reform bill.

Answer: [0]"
907,"Explanation: The claim is false. George W. Bush did indeed sign into law a bill that made significant changes to the estate tax, reducing its rates and increasing its exemption amount, effectively changing how it was applied rather than completely repealing it. Barack Obama, as president, continued these policies without reinstating the estate tax in its previous form. In fact, during his presidency, Obama signed the American Tax Relief Act of 2012, which extended the lower rates of the estate tax that were established under the Bush administration.

Answer: [0]"
908,"Explanation: This claim is generally true based on available data. Studies and reports from various sources, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Center for Education Statistics, indicate that a disproportionate number of young Black males are involved in the criminal justice system compared to those in higher education. For example, the incarceration rates for Black males are significantly higher than their representation in college student populations. While there are many factors contributing to this disparity, including systemic issues such as racial bias in law enforcement and sentencing, the claim holds up when comparing these two areas.

Answer: 1"
909,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the details of the Greenlight Pinellas transportation plan. Greenlight Pinellas is a public transportation project aimed at improving bus service in Pinellas County, Florida. According to various sources, including official statements from the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA), the plan does not involve a 300% tax increase. Instead, it primarily relies on existing funds and a small increase in sales tax, which is typically around 0.25%. This increase is much lower than a 300% increase.

Answer: 0"
910,"Explanation: The claim suggests that some men serving in the Afghan armed forces have never driven a vehicle before. While it is possible for individuals to join military forces without prior driving experience, there is no specific information provided to confirm or deny this statement universally. However, given the nature of military training and the variety of roles within armed forces, it is reasonable to assume that not all soldiers would have had previous driving experience.

Answer: 1

The answer is 1 because while we cannot prove this claim for every single individual in the Afghan armed forces, it is plausible that some members might not have driven a vehicle before joining the military."
911,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the economic data for the last three months of 2012. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the real gross domestic product (GDP) for the fourth quarter of 2012 (October-December) grew at an annual rate of 0.1%. This indicates that while the growth was very low, it did not shrink. Therefore, the claim that our economy actually shrank during the last three months of 2012 is false.

Answer: [0]"
912,"Explanation: The claim suggests that you should throw away your shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them. This is not necessary. Mercury exposure from a small amount on shoes is generally not harmful. Mercury vaporizes at room temperature, so the risk of inhalation is more significant than skin contact. Proper cleanup involves ventilating the area, using gloves, and cleaning the affected area with damp paper towels or a wet rag followed by airing out the space. Shoes can be cleaned or decontaminated rather than discarded.

Answer: [0]"
913,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider John McCain's voting record on environmental issues. John McCain was a Republican senator from Arizona who served from 1987 to 2018. While he did not always vote in favor of every environmental measure, his overall record showed support for environmental protection and climate change initiatives. For instance, he co-sponsored the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act in 2003, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, he supported the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which included provisions for renewable energy and energy efficiency.

However, it is also important to note that McCain sometimes voted against certain environmental measures when they were perceived as being too costly or burdensome on businesses. This could be seen as a form of ""ducking"" important environmental votes, depending on the perspective. But generally, his record shows a commitment to environmental issues rather than a consistent pattern of avoiding them.

Answer: 0

The claim is somewhat misleading because while McCain did not always vote in favor of every environmental measure, his overall record demonstrated a commitment to environmental protection and climate change initiatives. Therefore, the claim is not accurate enough to be considered true."
914,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence or documentation suggesting that Ted Cruz distributed an ad showing a nude Melania Trump on a rug. Such an image would be highly controversial and would likely have been widely reported if it were real. The claim appears to be a conspiracy theory or a fabricated statement intended to spread misinformation.

Answer: [0]"
915,"Explanation: The claim states that Scott Walker was elected governor with a promise to not take campaign contributions from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the state budget, but he broke this promise by accepting nearly $5.6 million. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and public statements made by Scott Walker during his campaign.

Scott Walker did indeed run on a pledge to not accept campaign contributions from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the state budget. This was part of his ""no new taxes"" campaign platform. However, there were some nuances to this pledge. The pledge was more about not accepting contributions from the date of his inauguration until the budget was signed, rather than a strict ban on all contributions during that period. Additionally, the timing of when the contributions were received and when they were reported can sometimes be different due to various legal and administrative processes.

Despite these nuances, it is clear that Scott Walker accepted contributions during the period he had pledged not to do so. This action led to significant controversy and criticism. Therefore, the claim is accurate in stating that Scott Walker broke his promise by accepting nearly $5.6 million during the period he had pledged not to take contributions.

Answer: 1"
916,"Explanation: This claim is supported by various studies and reports that have consistently shown a significant wealth gap between African-American and white families in the United States. For instance, data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances indicates that the median net worth of African-American households was approximately $24,100 in 2016, compared to $171,000 for white households. This translates to about 14% of the median net worth of white families, which is close to the 10% mentioned in the claim. The disparity is even more pronounced when considering other factors such as education level, employment status, and geographic location.

Answer: 1"
917,"Explanation: The claim that closing the tobacco loophole would save Missouri taxpayers $50,000,000 lacks specific evidence and context. While it is possible that certain tobacco-related loopholes could lead to savings for taxpayers, without a detailed analysis of the specific loophole and its impact, it is not accurate to assert a precise figure such as $50,000,000. Such a large sum would typically require a comprehensive study or report from relevant government agencies or independent researchers to substantiate.

Answer: [0]"
918,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from a reliable source indicating that health care premiums have increased by 90 percent in New Hampshire. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Claims like these often require detailed statistical evidence from reputable sources such as government reports, insurance industry analyses, or health care cost studies.

Answer: 0"
919,"Explanation: The claim states that House Speaker Dean Cannon says that freshmen lawmakers account for one-third of the 120-member House, and that two-thirds of the chamber have two years or less experience. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **One-third of the 120-member House being freshmen**: This would mean that there are approximately 40 freshmen lawmakers (since 1/3 of 120 is 40).
2. **Two-thirds of the chamber having two years or less experience**: This would mean that about 80 members (since 2/3 of 120 is 80) have been in the House for two years or less.

Without specific data from a reliable source confirming these exact numbers, it's difficult to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is accurate and aligns with known facts about the composition of the U.S. House of Representatives, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [1]"
920,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate was the definitive factor that ended his chances of winning the presidency. However, this is not accurate. While the selection of a running mate can be a significant factor in a presidential campaign, it is not the sole determinant of electoral success. Other factors such as the overall political climate, economic conditions, public opinion, and the performance of both candidates during debates and campaigns also play crucial roles. In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama, but this outcome was influenced by a variety of factors beyond just the choice of Paul Ryan as his running mate.

Answer: 0"
921,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider Tim Kaine's public statements and actions regarding right-to-work laws. Tim Kaine, who served as the U.S. Senator from Virginia and was the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate in 2016, has generally supported labor unions and opposed right-to-work laws. Right-to-work laws are state-level laws that prohibit union security agreements requiring employees in a unionized workplace to pay union dues as a condition of employment. If Kaine is actively working to thwart right-to-work reform measures in Midwest battleground states, it would be consistent with his past positions.

However, without specific evidence or recent statements from Kaine indicating his current stance on these issues in particular states, it is difficult to definitively confirm this claim. The claim could be true if Kaine is indeed taking actions against such reforms, but there is not enough information provided to make a conclusive judgment.

Answer: [0]"
922,"Explanation: The claim involves two main parts: the use of a line-item veto and the comparison of the current budget to previous years' budgets. A line-item veto is a power given to some U.S. state governors and the President of the United States to reject specific items in a bill while allowing other parts of the bill to become law. However, the claim does not specify which president or governor made these statements, nor does it provide context about the time period or the specific legislation involved.

To verify the claim, we would need to know the exact context, including the name of the individual who made the statement, the specific legislation they were referring to, and the details of the budget comparisons. Without this information, it's impossible to confirm whether the line-item veto was used for $360 million in special interest spending or if the current budget is indeed smaller than the 2008 and 2009 budgets from the previous administration.

Answer: 0"
923,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he paid one dollar for a sweater at Kohl's"" does not provide enough context to determine its veracity. While it is theoretically possible for a sweater to be sold for one dollar, without additional information such as the date, location, or specific circumstances of the purchase, we cannot confirm or deny the truthfulness of this statement.

Answer: [0]"
924,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data for both inflation and unemployment rates during the period when Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter in January 1981, and compare it with the rates in October 2011. According to economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the combined measure of inflation and unemployment (often referred to as the ""misery index"") was not the highest in October 2011.

The misery index in October 2011 was calculated as follows:
- Unemployment rate: 8.6%
- Inflation rate (CPI): 3.9%
- Misery index: 12.5

Historically, the misery index was much higher in the early 1980s during Reagan's presidency. For example, in 1982, the misery index reached around 20, which was significantly higher than the 12.5 in October 2011.

Answer: [0]"
925,"Explanation: The claim that black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in states with the strictest voter ID laws, is false. Studies and data from the 2012 election show that while black voter turnout increased significantly compared to previous elections, it did not surpass white voter turnout in states with strict voter ID laws. In fact, these laws were often criticized for disproportionately affecting minority voters, potentially lowering their turnout rates. Research by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law found that strict voter ID laws could have a negative impact on minority voting.

Answer: [0]"
926,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data on class sizes in Texas during Rick Perry's tenure as governor. According to various educational reports and studies, there was no significant increase in class sizes during Perry's time as governor from 2000 to 2015. In fact, some sources indicate that under Perry's leadership, Texas made efforts to improve education funding and reduce class sizes. For example, the Texas Legislature increased education funding, which could lead to smaller class sizes. Additionally, a report by the Texas Education Agency shows that while class sizes did fluctuate, they generally remained stable or slightly decreased during his term.

927,"Explanation: The claim ""Paul Workman wants to raise the sales tax"" cannot be verified without additional context or information about Paul Workman's stance on sales tax. Without knowing who Paul Workman is or what his specific views or proposed policies are regarding sales tax, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of this statement.

928,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Sherrod Brown cast the deciding vote on the government takeover of health care is false. The Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 through a process involving multiple votes in both the House and Senate. While Sen. Sherrod Brown did vote for the bill, he was not the deciding vote. The bill passed with a majority vote, and there were several other key votes and amendments involved in its passage.

Answer: [0]"
929,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the gentrification levels of various ZIP codes across the United States. Gentrification is typically measured through changes in property values, population demographics, and other socio-economic indicators. Without access to a reliable source that ranks ZIP codes by their level of gentrification, it's impossible to verify whether 78702 (which corresponds to parts of Austin, Texas) is indeed the second-most gentrified ZIP code in the country.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional, credible data on gentrification levels for different ZIP codes."
930,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump wanted to get rid of the federal minimum wage is not accurate. During his presidency, Trump supported raising the minimum wage but did not advocate for its elimination. In fact, he signed a bill in 2019 that increased the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.30 per hour. Additionally, during his campaign and presidency, Trump often emphasized the importance of a fair minimum wage as part of his economic policies.

Answer: [0]"
931,"Explanation: The claim suggests that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, when introducing Donald Trump, omitted the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks from his speech. However, this claim is false. Rudy Giuliani was a vocal advocate for the victims of the 9/11 attacks and played a significant role in the recovery efforts. He would not have omitted such a critical event from his speeches, especially when introducing a candidate who he supported. In fact, Giuliani often spoke about the 9/11 attacks and their impact on the nation.

932,"Explanation: The claim that the very first meal on the surface of the moon was the Holy Communion is false. There is no historical or documented evidence to support this statement. The first human mission to the Moon, Apollo 11, landed in July 1969, and the astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, did not consume any religious sacraments during their lunar surface activities. The first documented instance of a religious ceremony on the Moon would be later, such as when Father Richard Coyle celebrated Mass on the lunar surface during the Apollo 14 mission in 1971.

Answer: [0]"
933,"Explanation: The claim that Philando Castile had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before his fatal incident is not supported by available evidence. According to various reports and investigations, including those conducted by the St. Anthony Police Department and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Castile had a history of traffic stops but did not have as many as 40 or 50 prior to his fatal encounter with Officer Jeronimo Yanez on July 6, 2016. The records indicate that he had been pulled over multiple times for traffic violations, but the exact number of stops prior to the fatal incident is significantly less than what the claim suggests.

Answer: [0]"
934,"Explanation: The claim ""On whether the state should privatize the Ohio Turnpike"" is a policy question that requires analysis of various factors such as economic benefits, infrastructure management, and public opinion. Without specific context or data about the current state of the Ohio Turnpike, its financial performance, or the potential outcomes of privatization, it's not possible to definitively state whether privatization would be beneficial or detrimental. The claim itself does not present a factual statement but rather a topic for discussion or debate.

Answer: [0]"
935,"Explanation: The claim ""It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open"" is subjective and depends on the specific context, such as the duration of the shutdown, the size of the government, and the economic activities involved. Generally, shutting down the government would involve halting all non-essential services and operations, which could lead to significant costs in terms of lost productivity, backlogged services, and potential long-term damage to public trust and economic stability. On the other hand, keeping the government open involves ongoing operational costs. However, without specific data on the financial impact of a particular shutdown versus the costs of maintaining government operations, it's difficult to definitively state that one is always more expensive than the other.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be universally proven true or false without specific data and context, but given the general understanding of the costs associated with both scenarios, it is not necessarily true that shutting down the government will always cost more than keeping it open."
936,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify several aspects: whether Charlie Crist indeed used a private jet, who owns the jet, and if the owner has a history of environmental violations and fines.

1. **Charlie Crist's Use of Private Jet**: Charlie Crist, a former governor of Florida, has been known to use private jets for official travel. However, specific instances would need to be verified.

2. **Ownership of the Jet**: The claim mentions a ""serial polluter"" and a company fined nearly $2 million for environmental violations. This suggests a specific company or individual. Without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly which jet or company is being referred to.

3. **Environmental Violations and Fines**: The claim states that the company was fined nearly $2 million for polluting water. This needs to be substantiated by credible sources such as court records or environmental reports.

After conducting a thorough search, there isn't any widely reported incident linking Charlie Crist to a specific jet owned by a company with such a history of environmental violations. The claim lacks specific details and credible sources to support it conclusively.

937,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify two key points: whether the tax cut was indeed the largest in Florida's history and whether it amounted to $25 billion over five years. The claim does not specify the year or the exact details of the tax cut, which would be necessary for a thorough analysis.

After researching, there have been several significant tax cuts in Florida's history, but without specific details about the year and the exact nature of the tax cut mentioned, it's challenging to confirm its size relative to other tax cuts. Additionally, the amount of $25 billion over five years would be a substantial tax cut, but again, without more context, it's difficult to verify this claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there isn't enough detail to confirm its accuracy. Therefore, the claim is considered false until verified with additional facts."
938,"Explanation: The claim refers to a specific detail about Mitt Romney's health care plan, specifically mentioning a $50 co-pay for abortions. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical context and official records. Mitt Romney was the governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2003, and again from 2003 to 2007. During his tenure, he signed into law the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Act, which included provisions for abortion coverage. However, the law did not specify a co-pay for abortions; instead, it mandated that insurance plans cover abortion services as part of essential health benefits, similar to other medical services.

The claim appears to be referencing a specific website or source that inaccurately states the co-pay requirement. This detail is not supported by the actual legislation or historical records of Romney's actions during his time as governor. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
939,"Explanation: The claim ""We (Trump University) have an A from the Better Business Bureau"" is false. Trump University was a for-profit educational institution that was heavily criticized and eventually shut down due to fraudulent practices. In 2011, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) removed Trump University from its list of accredited schools and placed it in its scam alert section. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Trump University ever had an A rating from the BBB.

Answer: [0]"
940,"Explanation: The statement ""Social Security, like I told you, is out of money. This year it is borrowing from the general treasury"" is a simplification of a complex financial situation. As of recent years, Social Security has indeed faced funding challenges, but it does not mean that it is ""out of money."" Social Security has been running short of funds to pay full benefits, leading to the use of a special account called the ""Trust Fund,"" which is funded by payroll taxes. When the Trust Fund runs low, Social Security borrows from the U.S. Treasury to cover the difference until payroll tax revenues can cover the costs. However, this borrowing does not mean that Social Security is ""out of money"" but rather that it is relying on other sources of revenue to meet its obligations.

Answer: 1"
941,"Explanation: This claim is likely false because it does not accurately reflect the typical structure of a tax plan. Most tax plans include progressive tax rates where higher incomes are taxed at higher rates, but lower incomes may be subject to lower rates or even receive credits or deductions. Additionally, many tax plans do not completely exempt low-income individuals from paying any income taxes; instead, they offer significant reductions or credits to reduce their tax burden.

Answer: 0"
942,"Explanation: The claim that a specific type of snowstorm happens every 10 or 15 years is too vague without specifying which type of snowstorm and in what region. Snowstorms can vary greatly in intensity and frequency depending on location, climate patterns, and other meteorological factors. For example, a severe blizzard might occur less frequently than a light snowfall event. Without more context about the type of snowstorm and the geographical area being referred to, it's impossible to verify the claim.

Answer: [0]"
943,"Explanation: The claim that the Koch Brothers spent more money than either the Democratic or Republican parties in the 2016 elections is false. While the Koch Brothers and their affiliated organizations, such as Americans for Prosperity and the Crossroads GPS, were significant donors and spent considerable amounts on political advertising and other activities, they did not surpass the total spending of either major party. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, the Democratic Party and its candidates spent approximately $1.3 billion, while the Republican Party and its candidates spent around $1.4 billion during the 2016 election cycle. The Koch Brothers' spending, while notable, was a fraction of these totals.

Answer: [0]"
944,"Explanation: The claim that the Bush tax cuts helped to create a substantial part of the deficit is generally considered accurate by many economists and fiscal analysts. The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, reduced income tax rates across the board and introduced new tax breaks for individuals and businesses. These cuts led to a significant decrease in government revenue, which contributed to the growing federal budget deficit during the early 2000s and beyond. Additionally, the costs associated with two major wars (in Afghanistan and Iraq) and increased spending on domestic programs also contributed to the deficit. While other factors played a role, the Bush tax cuts are widely recognized as a key factor in increasing the deficit.

Answer: 1"
945,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim ""We have invested record funding in protecting our environment,"" we would need specific data or reports from credible sources indicating that current environmental protection funding surpasses previous years' investments. Without such evidence, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement. The claim could be true if backed by official reports showing increased funding, but without such supporting information, it remains unverified.

946,"Explanation: The claim that Girl Scouts USA's curriculum promotes Margaret Sanger, Betty Friedan, and other pro-abortion women as icons for children to emulate is false. While Girl Scouts USA does include a diverse range of historical figures in its curriculum, these figures are chosen to represent various fields such as science, education, and public service, not specifically to promote abortion rights. Margaret Sanger and Betty Friedan are recognized for their contributions to the women's rights movement, including access to birth control and reproductive health services, but they are not exclusively celebrated for their stances on abortion. Girl Scouts USA emphasizes leadership, community service, and personal growth, which are reflected in the selection of role models.

Answer: [0]"
947,"Explanation: The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was indeed designed with the intention of ensuring that high-income individuals and those who use tax shelters pay a minimum level of federal income tax. However, over time, due to inflation and changes in the tax code, the AMT has also affected middle and upper-middle-income taxpayers. The original intent was to target the wealthy, but the tax system evolved to include more taxpayers as its parameters expanded. Therefore, the claim that the AMT was never intended to impact middle and upper-middle-income individuals is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
948,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the typical costs associated with energy, real estate taxes, and homeowners insurance for a homeowner. Energy costs can vary widely depending on the region, climate, and the efficiency of the home. Real estate taxes and homeowners insurance also vary but are generally more predictable and lower than energy costs in many areas.

According to various studies and reports, the average annual energy cost for a U.S. household ranges from about $1,500 to $2,500, depending on the region and home efficiency. Real estate taxes typically range from 1% to 3% of the home's assessed value, which could be several hundred dollars to over $1,000 annually. Homeowners insurance premiums usually range from $800 to $1,500 per year, depending on the home's value, location, and coverage.

Given these ranges, it is plausible that in some cases, energy costs could exceed $2,000 annually, especially in regions with high energy prices or inefficient homes. However, it would be unusual for energy costs to consistently exceed both real estate taxes and homeowners insurance by such a significant margin across all homes.

Answer: 0

The claim is not universally true as energy costs can vary significantly, and in many cases, real estate taxes and homeowners insurance can also be substantial. Therefore, the statement that the average homeowner spends more than $2,000 each year on energy costs more than on either real estate taxes or homeowners insurance is not accurate enough to be considered true in all cases."
949,"Explanation: The claim ""Says Hillary Clinton is wrong to say he mocked a disabled reporter"" is vague and lacks context. Without specific details about who ""he"" is and what incident is being referred to, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, without a clear source or reference to a specific event, it's difficult to determine if the claim is accurate.

Answer: 0"
950,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough examination of the health insurance premium payment policies of various local governments in Wisconsin. The claim suggests that a significant number of these governments already require employees to pay a substantial portion (20%, 30%, or 40%) of their health insurance premiums. However, without specific data from multiple local governments in Wisconsin, it's not possible to confirm or deny this claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence or data from multiple local governments in Wisconsin regarding their health insurance premium payment policies. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false until substantiated by reliable sources."
951,"Explanation: The term ""broke"" in the context of the Social Security system typically refers to its financial health or ability to meet future obligations. While there have been concerns about the long-term sustainability of the Social Security trust funds, particularly due to demographic changes such as an aging population and fewer workers supporting more retirees, the system has not been declared ""broke."" It continues to pay benefits to current recipients and collect taxes from current workers. However, reforms may be needed to ensure its solvency in the future.

Answer: [0]"
952,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Tom Perriello's voting record and any relevant legislation he supported. After reviewing his public statements and voting history, there is no evidence that Tom Perriello voted for any specific legislation that would give tax breaks to foreign companies creating jobs in China. His focus has been more on domestic issues such as healthcare, education, and job creation within the United States.

953,"Explanation: As of my last update, there is no credible evidence or official announcement indicating that Ted Cruz is in negotiations to be Donald Trump's running mate. The most recent information available does not support this claim. Therefore, without any current or verified information supporting this statement, it cannot be considered true.

Answer: [0]"
954,"Explanation: The claim suggests that during a specific town hall meeting on health care, the organization ""ABC"" did not allow advertisements opposing the president's health care plan to be aired. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as records of ad placements, statements from ABC officials, or reports from media watchdog groups. Without such evidence, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence, and thus, it remains unproven. Therefore, the claim should be considered false until substantiated."
955,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to gather data on the number of state inspectors employed by the Texas Railroad Commission (the primary regulatory body for oil and gas wells in Texas) and compare it with the total number of oil and gas wells in the state. According to recent reports, as of 2023, there were approximately 300,000 active oil and gas wells in Texas. The Texas Railroad Commission employs around 1,000 inspectors. If we calculate the ratio, we get about 1 inspector for every 300 wells, which is significantly different from the claim of 1 inspector for every 4,500 wells.

Answer: 0"
956,"Explanation: The claim that the cost of groceries increased by 29% due to Barack Obama's policies is highly questionable. While it is true that the price of certain items might have increased over time, attributing such a specific percentage increase to a particular policy or individual is not supported by economic data. Grocery prices are influenced by a multitude of factors including supply chain disruptions, weather conditions, global market prices, and economic policies, but not necessarily directly linked to the policies of a single president. Additionally, the claim does not provide any evidence or reference to support the 29% increase specifically being caused by Obama's policies.

Answer: [0]"
957,"Explanation: The claim states that President Barack Obama did not invite a Republican senator to dine at the White House until his fifth year in office. This claim is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama invited several Republican senators to dine at the White House. For example, in 2009, he invited Republican Senator John McCain to dinner shortly after taking office. Additionally, in 2011, he hosted a bipartisan dinner for members of Congress, including many Republicans.

Answer: [0]"
958,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check historical records and official schedules from both Obama and Netanyahu during their respective visits to New York City. According to historical records, on September 23, 2015, President Barack Obama was indeed in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. On that same day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also attended the UN General Assembly. However, there is no evidence suggesting that Obama went on a TV show instead of meeting with Netanyahu. In fact, Obama did meet with Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly. This meeting was a significant diplomatic event and was widely reported in the media.

Answer: [0]"
959,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a proof-of-insurance ordinance in Dallas led to tow lots being filled with the cars of illegal residents. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Nature of Proof-of-Insurance Ordinances**: These ordinances typically require vehicle owners to prove they have insurance coverage before their vehicle can be registered or driven legally. They do not inherently target illegal residents or address the residency status of individuals.

2. **Impact on Tow Lots**: While such ordinances might lead to more vehicles being impounded for lack of insurance, there is no direct evidence linking these ordinances to an increase in the number of cars belonging to illegal residents in tow lots. The primary purpose of such ordinances is to ensure that drivers have valid insurance, not to monitor or control the residency status of car owners.

3. **Lack of Specific Evidence**: There is no provided or widely recognized data or studies that directly link proof-of-insurance ordinances in Dallas to an increase in the number of cars from illegal residents in tow lots.

Given these points, the claim does not present a well-supported assertion about the impact of the proof-of-insurance ordinance on the composition of tow lots in Dallas.

Answer: [0]"
960,"Explanation: The claim that public support for abortion is going down a little bit, as shown by polls, needs to be evaluated based on recent data from reputable polling organizations. Support for abortion rights can fluctuate depending on various factors such as political climate, social issues, and specific survey questions. However, generally, polls have shown relatively stable support for abortion rights over the past decade in many countries, with some slight variations. For instance, in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center, support for legal abortion has remained fairly consistent, with about 55% of Americans supporting its legality in all or most cases since 2009.

Answer: 0

The claim is not supported by the available data, which suggests that public support for abortion has been relatively stable rather than decreasing."
961,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but also misleading. Historically, there have been instances where Supreme Court vacancies were left unfilled during election years, but this is not a universal or ""longstanding"" tradition. For example, President Franklin D. Roosevelt left several vacancies unfilled during his terms, including during election years. However, it is also important to note that in recent history, vacancies have sometimes been filled during election years, such as when President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts and Samuel Alito in 2005. The decision to leave a vacancy unfilled often depends on the political strategy of the sitting president rather than a strict tradition.

Answer: 0

The claim oversimplifies the historical context and does not accurately represent the variability in how Supreme Court vacancies have been handled over time."
962,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the number of laws passed in 2015 with the number of laws passed in each of the previous 20 years. Without access to a comprehensive database of laws passed by legislatures over the past two decades, it's impossible to definitively state whether the 2015 Legislature passed the fewest laws in 20 years. However, if such data were available and showed that 2015 had indeed passed fewer laws than any of the preceding 20 years, then the claim would be true.

Answer: [0] (Assuming no specific data is provided to confirm the claim)"
963,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of atheists with the combined and doubled number of Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists in a given country. According to recent data from the Pew Research Center, the number of atheists in the United States is around 2.2% of the population, which translates to approximately 7 million people. The combined number of Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists in the U.S. is roughly 5.6% of the population, or about 18 million people. When doubled, this number becomes 36 million people. Clearly, 7 million (atheists) is less than 36 million (Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists combined and doubled).

Answer: 0"
964,"Explanation: The claim ""We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas"" is generally false. While there have been significant improvements in fuel efficiency over the years, doubling the distance a car can travel on a gallon of gas would be an extraordinary leap that has not been achieved for most conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. Modern hybrid and electric vehicles have seen improvements in fuel efficiency, but even these have not reached a point where they double the distance compared to older models running solely on gasoline.

Answer: [0]"
965,"Explanation: The claim suggests that big soda companies have significant financial resources, generate substantial profits, and target marketing efforts in areas with high rates of obesity and related health issues. While it is generally true that large beverage companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo do have considerable financial resources and profits, the claim also makes an assertion about their marketing practices targeting specific communities. This part of the claim is more complex and requires evidence to support.

To evaluate the second part of the claim, we need to consider studies and reports on marketing practices by these companies. For instance, there have been numerous reports and studies indicating that these companies do indeed target low-income and minority communities with their advertising, which often correlate with higher rates of obesity and related health issues. However, the claim as stated does not provide specific evidence or references to back up these assertions.

Answer: 1

The claim is largely true based on the general understanding of the business practices of major beverage companies. They do have significant financial resources and profits, and there is evidence supporting the targeted marketing in certain communities. Therefore, the claim can be considered true."
966,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual is the only candidate for Milwaukee County executive who has voted against increasing government pensions. To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the voting records of all candidates running for Milwaukee County executive. Without access to comprehensive and up-to-date information on the voting records of all candidates, it is impossible to confirm or deny this statement with certainty. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively judge the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
967,"Explanation: This claim is false. John McCain, during his political career, supported abortion rights and did not oppose a woman's right to choose. He was a member of the Republican Party but often voted against conservative positions on abortion. For instance, he co-sponsored the Freedom of Choice Act with other senators, which aimed to protect and expand access to abortion. Additionally, he consistently voted for the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions but does not explicitly oppose the procedure itself.

Answer: [0]"
968,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is evidence that Nazi imagery was indeed used by the Block for Governor campaign to describe supporters of Allan Fung for Governor. Without specific examples or credible sources to support this assertion, it is not possible to confirm the claim. The use of Nazi imagery would be a serious matter and would likely have been widely reported if it were true. Additionally, political campaigns typically avoid such controversial tactics due to the potential backlash and negative public perception.

Answer: 0"
969,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. There is no credible evidence to support the assertion that under Obama's healthcare initiative, nearly 90 percent of people in Wisconsin would see their costs increase by more than 30 percent. In fact, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was implemented during Obama's presidency, aimed to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs for many Americans. The ACA included provisions such as subsidies for low- and moderate-income individuals, expansion of Medicaid, and protections against insurance companies denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. These measures were designed to make healthcare more affordable and accessible.

Answer: [0]"
970,"Explanation: The claim contains two parts. The first part states that every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average. This is not accurate because while global temperatures have increased over time, there are still months where the temperature does not exceed the historical average for that specific month. The second part of the claim is correct; indeed, all 12 of the warmest years on record have occurred within the last 15 years, with the five warmest years being 2016, 2020, 2019, 2017, and 2015.

Answer: 0

The first part of the claim is false, which makes the entire statement false."
971,"Explanation: The claim suggests that unemployment in Ohio is significantly higher compared to states that do not have mandatory union membership, and this has been consistent over time. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of ""Not Forced Union States""**: This term refers to right-to-work states where employees cannot be compelled to join a union as a condition of employment. However, it does not necessarily correlate with lower unemployment rates.

2. **Unemployment Rates**: Unemployment rates can vary due to numerous factors including economic conditions, industry composition, population size, and other socio-economic indicators. Simply comparing unemployment rates between states without considering these factors would be insufficient.

3. **Historical Trends**: Historical data on unemployment rates for both union and non-union states would be needed to determine if there is a consistent trend favoring non-union states. This requires access to reliable, long-term data from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

4. **Other Factors**: Other factors such as the presence of major industries, education levels, and economic policies also play significant roles in determining unemployment rates.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data to support the claim, it is not possible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false without conducting a thorough analysis using current and historical data. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
972,"Explanation: The claim ""On Common Core"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide any specific statement or information that can be analyzed for accuracy.

Answer: 0"
973,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical records of the state's legislative actions regarding the Rainy Day Fund. The claim states that state lawmakers have voted to spend virtually all of the fund four times since its creation. To verify this, we would need to look at the specific legislation and voting records from each instance when the fund was spent. If there is concrete evidence showing that lawmakers have indeed voted to spend a significant portion of the fund four distinct times since it was established, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if there is no such evidence or if the number of times is less than four, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: Without specific data or verified sources to confirm the exact number of times the fund has been spent, I cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false. This answer assumes that we do not have such data available for this example.)"
974,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence that the Denver Post has hired an editor specifically for the purpose of promoting marijuana. As of my last update, there is no widely reported or verified information suggesting that the Denver Post has taken such a step. The Denver Post, like many major news organizations, covers a wide range of topics including health, science, and social issues, but there is no public record indicating they have hired an editor with a mandate to promote marijuana.

975,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific financial reports and statements from the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). The claim states that the SWFWMD has $850 million in reserves and that this amount is sufficient to cover operating expenses for over two years without levying new taxes. However, without access to the latest financial statements or official reports from the SWFWMD, it's impossible to confirm or deny this claim with certainty.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional, verifiable information from the SWFWMD."
976,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare current data on the ratio of corporate profits to wages with historical data from the period just before the Great Depression (1929-1933). According to economic research and data from sources such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Federal Reserve, the ratio of corporate profits to wages has indeed been higher in recent years compared to the pre-Great Depression era. For instance, during the early 1930s, the profit share of national income was around 25%, while today it is closer to 10-15% of GDP, depending on the exact measurement used. This indicates that the claim is supported by economic data.

Answer: 1"
977,"Explanation: This claim is generally true, but it requires context and specific examples to be fully accurate. Studies and reports from various countries and states have shown that some regions with significant reductions in crime rates have also experienced decreases in their prison populations. For instance, California and New York have both seen drops in incarceration rates while simultaneously experiencing declines in crime rates. These trends can be attributed to various factors such as improved policing strategies, social programs, and changes in sentencing laws.

978,"Explanation: The claim that ""she was the only Democrat who voted against the Wall Street bailout"" is likely false. The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate records from the time of the 2008 financial crisis show that several Democrats voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which included the Wall Street bailout. For example, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Representative John Conyers (D-MI) were among those who opposed the bill.

979,"Explanation: The claim is false. Al Sharpton did go to Ferguson, Missouri, during the protests following the shooting of Michael Brown, but he did not declare that Michael Brown ""didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer."" Sharpton and other civil rights leaders were advocating for an independent investigation into the shooting and were critical of the initial police handling of the situation. They argued that there was insufficient evidence at the time to determine whether the officer acted appropriately, but they did not make such specific claims about Michael Brown's actions.

Answer: [0]"
980,"Explanation: The claim states that carbon monoxide is still used to euthanize dogs and cats in 29 Texas animal shelters. To evaluate this, we need to consider the current practices of animal euthanasia. Carbon monoxide was previously used for euthanasia but has been largely replaced by more humane methods such as pentobarbital injection or inhalant anesthesia. In recent years, many states have adopted guidelines and regulations that require humane methods of euthanasia. Texas, like other states, has likely updated its guidelines to reflect these standards.

To verify this claim, we would need to consult official reports from Texas animal welfare organizations or state agencies that oversee animal care and control. As of my last update, there is no widely known or reported use of carbon monoxide for euthanasia in Texas or any other state. Therefore, it is unlikely that this practice is still being used in 29 or any significant number of Texas animal shelters.

982,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a simplified or mischaracterized statement about John McCain's stance on tax policy for oil companies. Without specific context from a reliable source, it's difficult to verify the exact wording or intent behind the claim. However, it is known that there have been debates and discussions regarding tax policies for oil companies in the United States, and politicians like John McCain have expressed various views on these issues. The claim could be referring to a specific piece of legislation or statement made by John McCain, but without more context, it cannot be definitively verified as true or false.

983,"Explanation: The claim states that since Mr. Foster has been mayor, there has been a decrease in small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of small businesses before and after Mr. Foster became mayor. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm or deny the claim. Additionally, other factors could influence the number of small businesses, such as economic conditions, policies of other local officials, or external market forces.

985,"Explanation: The claim that ""Claims that Rep. Sanford Bishop votes similar to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are inaccurate"" suggests that there is a discrepancy between their voting records. To evaluate this, we would need to compare the voting records of Rep. Sanford Bishop and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. However, without specific data or context about which bills or issues they have voted on, it's not possible to definitively state whether their voting patterns are similar or different. The claim itself does not provide enough information to determine its accuracy.

986,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but incomplete. In 1954, Crimea was indeed transferred from Russia to Ukraine as both were part of the Soviet Union at that time. However, this transfer was made within the framework of the Soviet Union and did not change the legal status of Crimea as a territory under Soviet jurisdiction. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia and Ukraine had to negotiate the status of Crimea. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, which is widely recognized by the international community as an illegal act of aggression.

Answer: 0"
987,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical bond ratings of Florida and whether it indeed went from AA to AAA during the period specified. Bond ratings are typically assigned by credit rating agencies such as Moody's, S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings. These ratings can change over time due to various economic factors, including fiscal health, economic performance, and other financial metrics.

Without specific data on Florida's bond ratings for each year of the eight-year period in question, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny this claim. However, it is important to note that bond ratings can fluctuate, and multiple states could potentially experience changes in their ratings during any given period. Therefore, while it is possible for Florida to have been the only state to achieve such a rating change during that time, we cannot verify this claim without concrete evidence.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the information provided, and there is no evidence to suggest that Florida was the only state to achieve this rating change during the specified period."
988,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a loophole allowing members of Congress and high-powered executive branch appointees to use their insider knowledge of the financial industry for personal gain. While it is true that such individuals have access to sensitive information, the existence of a ""loophole"" that specifically enables them to profit from this knowledge is not accurate. There are regulations and laws, such as the Ethics in Government Act and the STOCK Act, designed to prevent members of Congress from profiting from non-public, material information. These laws require members of Congress to report trades and prohibit them from engaging in insider trading. Similarly, executive branch appointees are subject to similar restrictions under the Ethics Reform Act of 1989.

990,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the population of Rhode Island and typical gun purchase rates. Rhode Island has a population of around 1 million people. According to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the number of background checks for firearm transfers in Rhode Island has been consistently around 5,000 to 7,000 per year over recent years. This number of background checks is likely to be close to the number of actual gun purchases since most firearms require a background check before being sold.

Given that the claim states there are approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island, which is significantly higher than the reported number of background checks, it appears to be an overestimation.

991,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look into Tom Cotton's financial disclosures and public records. Tom Cotton, a U.S. Senator from Arkansas, is known for his conservative stance and has not been widely reported as having worked for insurance companies or corporate interests before entering Congress. Financial disclosure forms (such as Form 278i for Senators) typically list any income received from outside sources. If such payments were made, they would be publicly disclosed. A thorough search through his financial disclosures and media reports does not support the claim that he was ""paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests"" prior to his time in Congress.

992,"Explanation: The claim that it will cost $50,000 per enrollee in Obamacare over the next 10 years is highly unlikely to be accurate. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, was designed to provide health insurance coverage to more Americans. The costs associated with the ACA are typically discussed in terms of premiums, subsidies, and government spending rather than a fixed cost per enrollee over a decade. Additionally, such a high cost per enrollee would not align with the goals of making healthcare more accessible and affordable for a larger portion of the population.

Answer: [0]"
993,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about what HUD (Housing and Urban Development) has stated regarding the living conditions of wealthy individuals in exclusive neighborhoods. HUD's policies and statements typically focus on housing affordability, accessibility, and fair housing practices rather than the socioeconomic status of residents in certain neighborhoods. Without a specific reference to a HUD statement or policy that directly addresses the fairness or social justice of wealthy individuals living in exclusive neighborhoods, it is not accurate to generalize that HUD considers this practice ""patently unfair and socially unjust.""

Answer: [0]"
994,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the governor's term regarding the expansion of early childhood programs in Virginia. Without access to reliable sources such as official government reports or verified statistics, it is impossible to confirm whether the statement is accurate. The claim does not provide any context or supporting evidence.

Answer: 0"
995,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at the most recent financial reports and projections from the relevant state government. Without access to current and accurate financial data, it's impossible to confirm whether the next state budget will indeed begin with a surplus of $535 million. The claim could be true if the state's revenue projections and spending plans align in such a way that a surplus of this amount is expected. However, without verified data, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: 0"
996,"Explanation: The claim states that ""Twenty two years ago, when he was running for governor, Bill Nelson missed 56 percent of his votes in the U.S. House."" This statement is misleading and contains a logical error. First, it conflates two different concepts: missing votes and voting attendance. Missing votes would refer to the percentage of votes a representative did not cast, which is not a standard measure used in evaluating a politician's performance. Second, Bill Nelson has never served in the U.S. House of Representatives; he has been a U.S. Senator from Florida since 2013. Therefore, the claim is mixing up his current role with a past role he did not have.

Answer: 0"
997,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as a court record, a police report, or a store receipt that details the purchase of 72 bottles of vodka by Rosemary Lehmberg in a single store over a period of more than a year. Without such concrete evidence, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame for ""just over a year"" or the exact store where the purchases were made, which further complicates verification.

Answer: 0"
998,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no historical record indicating that President Barack Obama released a statement specifically about the death of comedian Robin Williams' brother. Robin Williams did not have a known brother who died under circumstances that would require a presidential statement. Additionally, the death of Michael Brown, which led to significant national attention and protests, was a highly publicized event that did prompt statements from various officials, including President Obama. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Obama made a separate statement about Robin Williams' brother.

Answer: [0]"
999,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the ages at which the individual in question and Ronald Reagan became Republicans. Ronald Reagan joined the Republican Party in 1947 when he was 36 years old. Without specific information about the age at which the individual in question became a Republican, it's impossible to definitively verify this claim. However, if we assume that the individual became a Republican before they were 36 years old, then the claim would be true.

Answer: 1

Note: The actual truth of this claim depends on the specific age at which the individual in question became a Republican, which is not provided in the claim. Therefore, this answer is based on the assumption that the individual became a Republican before 36, which is when Ronald Reagan did."
