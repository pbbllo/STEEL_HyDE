0,"Explanation: The claim is false. English is indeed the de facto national language of the United States, but it is not the official language. The U.S. Constitution does not designate an official language, and federal law does not require the use of English in any official capacity. In fact, the U.S. Census Bureau allows respondents to answer questions in any language they prefer. Additionally, many states and cities have laws that allow the use of multiple languages on ballots and other official documents. Therefore, the claim that making English official would prevent the use of other languages in places like New York City is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
1,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific Gallup poll result, but it's important to note that Gallup polls are not always representative of the entire population and can vary based on the sample size and methodology. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific details about the poll, such as the exact wording of the question, the sample size, or the time period of the poll. Without these details, it's difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0"
2,"Explanation: The claim that Chicago takes more guns off the streets than New York or Los Angeles is not accurate. According to data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, Chicago has a higher rate of gun-related crimes compared to New York and Los Angeles. In 2020, Chicago had 1,035 gun-related homicides, while New York had 309 and Los Angeles had 299. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
3,"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has indeed proposed the idea of building a mirror system in space to reflect sunlight back to Earth. This concept is part of a broader proposal to address climate change and improve the Earth's habitability. The idea is to place large mirrors in space to redirect sunlight towards the Earth, potentially increasing the planet's temperature and helping to mitigate the effects of global warming. While the feasibility and practicality of this idea are still subjects of scientific debate, the claim that Gingrich has suggested this is true.

Answer: 1"
4,"Explanation: The claim suggests that allowing brewpubs to sell beer in Georgia could lead to a situation where only a couple of manufacturers control the market, similar to Mexico. However, this claim is misleading and not supported by evidence. The brewpub industry is typically small-scale and local, with many independent operators. The market is not likely to consolidate into a few large manufacturers. Additionally, Georgia's alcohol laws and regulations are distinct from Mexico's, and the comparison is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
5,"Explanation: The claim is true. Commercial nuclear power has not resulted in any deaths of the American public. While there have been incidents like the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, these were not commercial nuclear power plants in the United States. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a strong safety record, and no member of the American public has been killed by commercial nuclear power.

Answer: 1"
6,"Explanation: The claim about the people in Massachusetts liking the state health care plan by a 3-1 margin is not supported by any specific data or survey results. While there may be general support for the state's health care initiatives, a 3-1 margin is a specific and quantifiable claim that requires evidence to support it. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be considered true.

Answer: 0"
7,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama is trying to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is false. President Obama did not attempt to pack the court. The term ""packing the court"" refers to the practice of increasing the number of judges on a court to influence its decisions. President Obama did not propose or attempt to increase the number of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Answer: 0"
8,"Explanation: The claim states that less than half of 1 percent of all Texas legislators who ever served draw a benefit from pensions tied to the salaries of state district judges. This claim is difficult to verify without specific data on the number of legislators who have served and the number of those who receive such pensions. However, the claim is phrased in a way that suggests a very small percentage, which is typically difficult to achieve in large groups. Therefore, without concrete evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is likely true, as it is a small fraction of the total number of legislators.

Answer: 1"
9,"Explanation: The claim that Rep. Tammy Duckworth has been a staunch supporter of expanding the spending, size, and reach of the IRS is not accurate. While Rep. Duckworth has advocated for increased funding for the IRS to improve its ability to enforce tax laws and collect revenues, she has not been a strong proponent of expanding the IRS's size or reach beyond its current scope. Her primary focus has been on improving the IRS's efficiency and effectiveness, rather than advocating for a significant increase in its size or scope.

Answer: 0"
10,"Explanation: Mitt Romney did not give away his father's inheritance. In fact, he inherited a significant amount of money from his father, George Romney, and used it to start his political career and business ventures. The claim that he gave away his father's inheritance is false.

Answer: 0"
11,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that federal bureaucrats could take over local building code enforcement due to non-compliance with energy efficiency legislation. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the role of federal regulations in local building codes. Federal energy efficiency legislation typically provides guidelines and incentives, but does not give the federal government the authority to directly enforce local building codes.

Answer: 0"
12,"Explanation: The claim that 97 percent of scientists believe humans are causing climate change has been widely cited and supported by numerous studies. The claim that this number was pulled out of thin air is false. The head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has not debunked this claim. The IPCC's reports consistently state that the consensus among scientists is that humans are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.

Answer: 0"
13,"Explanation: The claim is false. Federal spending is not entirely discretionary. While some spending, such as defense and non-defense discretionary spending, can be adjusted annually through the budget process, mandatory spending, which includes Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, is not discretionary. These programs are funded automatically based on formulas in the law, and Congress does not have the discretion to change the law to alter these spending levels in the same way it does for discretionary spending.

Answer: 0"
14,"Explanation: The claim is false. Bernie Sanders has endorsed several candidates for various positions, including presidential candidates. The claim that the speaker is the only candidate to have endorsed Sanders is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
15,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, during his presidential campaign, Romney stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop"" by political opponents.

Answer: 1"
16,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not specify which judge or case is being referred to. It also does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
17,"Explanation: The claim that judges are using Shariah law in Dearborn, Michigan is false. Dearborn, like all other cities in the United States, operates under the U.S. legal system, which is based on common law and federal and state constitutions. There is no evidence to suggest that Shariah law is being used in Dearborn or any other city in the U.S. This claim is a misinterpretation of the fact that Dearborn has a significant Muslim population and some local businesses may operate under Islamic principles, but this does not extend to the legal system.

Answer: 0"
18,"Explanation: The claim states that John doesn't have a record in the Senate and that he has only passed four bills, all of which are about post offices. This claim is false because it is not possible to have a record in the Senate without passing any bills. Additionally, the claim that John has only passed four bills is not accurate as it is not specified which bills were passed or the context in which they were passed.

Answer: 0"
19,"Explanation: According to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, Georgia ranks 10th among states with the highest number of uninsured people. Therefore, the claim that Georgia has the fifth-highest number of uninsured people is false.

Answer: 0"
20,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed shifted his stance on abortion over time. In the past, he has supported abortion rights, including a statement in 2012 where he said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" However, in recent years, he has become more vocal about his opposition to abortion, aligning himself with the pro-life movement. Therefore, the claim that he is now ""pro-life"" is accurate.

Answer: 1"
21,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""three companies got 90 percent of that"" is misleading. It implies that the three companies (CVS and two others) received 90% of the $35 million, which would be $31.5 million. However, the claim does not specify how much each of the three companies received, nor does it provide evidence that the two companies not located in Rhode Island received a significant portion of the $35 million. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as it stands.

Answer: 0"
22,"Explanation: The claim is false. The largest structural deficit in Wisconsin's history was in the 2011-2012 fiscal year, not two years ago. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the fiscal year 2019-2020, which had a structural deficit of $1.3 billion, but this was not the largest in Wisconsin's history.

Answer: 0"
23,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Scott allowed Republican legislators to cut his teacher pay raise proposal by 60 percent is false. In 2018, Gov. Scott proposed a $1,000 raise for teachers, but the Florida Legislature ultimately approved a $1,000 raise for teachers in the 2019-2020 school year. The proposal was not cut by 60 percent; instead, it was reduced by $500, which is a 33.33% reduction from the original proposal. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
24,"Explanation: The claim is false. The New York Times, like any other news organization, can be sued for defamation if they publish false information that harms someone's reputation. The claim that they cannot be sued for publishing false stories is incorrect. Journalists and news organizations are subject to the same legal standards as any other entity when it comes to defamation and libel.

25,"Explanation: As of 2021, the population of Fort Worth is approximately 874,000 people. The Texas Workforce Commission reported that in April 2021, Texas had a total of 1,025,000 new jobs created. Therefore, the claim that more Texans have new jobs today than the entire population of Fort Worth is true.

Answer: 1"
26,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst signed a pledge that protects tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas is false. There is no evidence or record of such a pledge. Ernst has been vocal about her support for businesses and job creation, but there is no specific pledge that aligns with the claim.

27,"Explanation: The claim states that the person was the top ROTC officer in the nation. However, without specific evidence or verification from a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the authenticity of this claim. The claim could be true, but it could also be an exaggeration or a fabrication.

Answer: 0"
28,"Explanation: The claim that Florida students take an array of standardized high-stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year is an exaggeration. While standardized testing does take up a significant amount of time in Florida schools, the 45 school days figure is not accurate. According to the Florida Department of Education, the average student in Florida spends about 20-25 days per year on standardized testing, which is a significant portion of the school year but not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
29,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Security Agency (NSA) is authorized to collect certain types of communications data, including phone calls, under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This section allows the NSA to collect ""any tangible thing"" relevant to a foreign intelligence investigation, including phone records. However, the NSA must obtain a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to collect such data. This process is different from the FISA warrant process, which is used for surveillance of individuals suspected of espionage or terrorism. Therefore, the claim that it is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans' phone calls without a specific FISA warrant is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
30,"Explanation: The claim that the United States is ""seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s"" is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other economic studies. According to these sources, income inequality in the U.S. has been increasing since the 1970s, with the top 1% of earners capturing a larger share of the total income. However, the claim that this level of inequality is greater than any time since the 1920s is not accurate. The 1920s was a period of significant income inequality, but the current level of inequality is not as high as it was during that time.

Answer: 0"
31,"Explanation: The claim that amniocentesis results more often than not in abortion in this country is false. Amniocentesis is a procedure used to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus. The results of the test are used to make informed decisions about the pregnancy, but the decision to terminate the pregnancy is not a result of the test itself. The test is performed to provide information, and the decision to terminate the pregnancy is made by the parents based on that information. Therefore, the claim that amniocentesis results more often than not in abortion is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
32,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by former U.S. President Barack Obama. The statement itself is a subjective assessment of Iran's threat level, which can vary based on political, military, and diplomatic perspectives. While Iran is not considered a superpower in the traditional sense, it does pose significant regional and international threats due to its nuclear program, support for militant groups, and geopolitical influence. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
33,"Explanation: The claim about the percentage of minimum wage workers in Rhode Island who serve as sole income earners for their family is based on a specific study or data source. To verify this claim, I would need to check the source of the data and ensure it is accurate and up-to-date. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without a reliable source.)"
34,"Explanation: The claim is false. John Boehner, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has not called for repealing the entire stimulus package, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle-class people. The claim is a misinterpretation of his stance on the stimulus package. Boehner has been critical of certain aspects of the stimulus but has not advocated for its complete repeal.

Answer: 0"
38,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two unrelated phenomena: the number of people who have seen UFOs and the approval rating of George W. Bush's presidency. These two topics are not directly related, and there is no evidence to suggest that the number of people who have seen UFOs is related to the approval rating of a former president. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
39,"Explanation: Zephyr Teachout, a political candidate, has publicly stated her opposition to Super PACs, which are political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. However, it is possible for candidates to accept donations from individuals or groups that support Super PACs, as long as the candidate does not directly benefit from the Super PAC's activities. The claim suggests that Teachout is against Super PACs but has taken money from Super PAC donors, which is a nuanced issue. Without specific evidence of Teachout directly benefiting from Super PAC funds, the claim is difficult to verify as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
40,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not say she was under attack in Bosnia and then found out it was young girls handing her flowers. This is a misinterpretation of a genuine event. In 1996, Clinton was in Bosnia and was greeted by a group of young girls who handed her flowers. She did not describe this as an attack.

Answer: 0"
41,"Explanation: The claim that drug testing for welfare recipients will save money is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies have shown that the costs of implementing drug testing programs often outweigh the savings. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other organizations have criticized drug testing programs for welfare recipients, arguing that they are ineffective and costly. Furthermore, the potential savings are often overstated, and the programs can lead to increased administrative burdens and legal challenges.

Answer: 0"
42,"Explanation: The claim states that New Hampshire's second congressional district includes two counties where at least 5% of residents are enrolled in the state's expanded Medicaid program. To verify this, I would need to check the specific enrollment data for the counties within New Hampshire's second congressional district. However, based on general information, it is known that New Hampshire has expanded Medicaid, and some counties may have higher enrollment rates. Without specific data, it is difficult to confirm the exact percentage for the two counties mentioned.

Answer: 0/1"
43,"Explanation: The claim is false. Dr. Paul, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, has voted for legislation that is not expressly authorized by the Constitution. For example, he has voted for bills related to healthcare, education, and other areas that are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. The Constitution does not provide a list of topics that Congress can or cannot legislate on, and the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress has the power to legislate on any subject not explicitly prohibited by the Constitution.

Answer: 0"
44,"Explanation: According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the dropout rate in Georgia was 7.9% in 2019, while Alabama's dropout rate was 6.8% in the same year. Therefore, Georgia's dropout rate is higher than Alabama's.

Answer: 1"
45,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama flip-flopped on warrantless wiretapping is false. During his presidential campaign, Obama criticized President George W. Bush's warrantless wiretapping program, stating that it was unconstitutional and violated privacy rights. However, after taking office, Obama continued and expanded the program, arguing that it was necessary for national security. This is a well-documented shift in policy, but it does not constitute a ""flip-flop"" in the sense of changing one's position on a specific issue.

Answer: 0"
46,"Explanation: The claim is based on a national study of 2,500 charter schools, which suggests that 20% of these schools perform better than community public schools, 40% perform worse, and the remaining 40% have no significant difference. This claim is not verifiable as it does not provide specific sources or data to support the percentages. Without concrete evidence or a reference to a specific study, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of these figures.

Answer: 0"
47,"Explanation: Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. During his presidency, he signed numerous bills into law. Some of the notable ones include the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, the claim that Barack Obama hasn't passed any bills is false.

Answer: 0"
48,"Explanation: Bernie Sanders has been a member of the U.S. Senate since 2007, and he has served in the House of Representatives from 1991 to 2007. During his time in Congress, Sanders has been known for his progressive policies and has introduced numerous amendments. However, the claim that he passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member is not accurate. Sanders has introduced many amendments, but the claim that he passed more than any other member in a Republican Congress is not supported by reliable sources or data.

Answer: 0"
50,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the job losses during the Great Recession (2007-2009) to the combined job losses of the last four recessions before it. The Great Recession resulted in a net loss of approximately 8.8 million jobs, while the combined job losses of the previous four recessions (1980-1982, 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009) were around 5.5 million jobs. Therefore, the claim that we lost more jobs in the Great Recession than the last four recessions combined is true.

Answer: 1"
51,"Explanation: The claim that Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest disparity of income in the country is not accurate. While Milwaukee does have a significant income disparity, Mequon, a suburb of Milwaukee, is generally considered to have a more affluent population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Milwaukee has a higher poverty rate and income disparity compared to Mequon. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
52,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement made by budget analysts, which is a common perspective in economic discussions. However, it is not specific enough to be definitively true or false without more context. Budget analysts often use models and projections to predict the economic impact of tax hikes and spending cuts, but their predictions can vary based on assumptions and methodologies. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false without additional specific data or context.

Answer: 0"
53,"Explanation: The claim that ""When Pakistan erupted in crisis, I spoke to Musharraf before Bush did"" is a statement made by former U.S. President George W. Bush. This claim is often used to highlight Bush's direct involvement in the situation and his immediate response to the crisis. However, the claim itself is not verifiable through independent sources and is based on Bush's own account. Without additional evidence or verification from other sources, it is difficult to definitively confirm the claim's truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
54,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, threatened to secede from the United States is false. While Perry has expressed support for Texas independence in the past, he has not made any recent threats to secede.

Answer: 0"
55,"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold said that with Obamacare, we could keep our doctors and our plans, and that it was rated as the Lie of the Year, is false. Russ Feingold, a former U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, did not make this statement. The claim is a misattribution of a statement made by President Obama during the 2009 healthcare reform debate. The statement was later rated as the ""Lie of the Year"" by PolitiFact, but it was not made by Russ Feingold.

Answer: 0"
56,"Explanation: The claim that Houston is home to more doctors, more nurses, and more researchers than any other place in the world is not accurate. While Houston is a major medical hub with several renowned hospitals and research institutions, it does not have the highest number of doctors, nurses, or researchers globally. For instance, cities like New York, London, and Tokyo have larger populations and more healthcare professionals. Additionally, the claim does not specify the criteria for ""more"" (e.g., per capita, total number, etc.), which makes it difficult to verify without additional context.

Answer: 0"
57,"Explanation: The claim that Bill White did not pay taxes while earning $133,600 as deputy secretary of energy is false. Tax obligations are based on income, and it is highly unlikely that a high-ranking government official would not pay taxes on their salary. Additionally, there is no credible source provided to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
58,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. tax code is 80,000 pages is often cited but is not accurate. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is indeed extensive, but the total length of the tax code, including regulations and other related documents, is estimated to be around 70,000 pages. This discrepancy is often due to the inclusion of various regulations and other documents that are not part of the IRC itself.

Answer: 0"
59,"Explanation: The claim that Fox News gave Republican senators twice the air time as Democrats during a hearing about the Islamic State is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. Fox News has not publicly reported or acknowledged such a discrepancy in air time. Additionally, media bias is a complex issue, and claims about specific biases in air time need to be backed by concrete data and not just assertions.

Answer: 0"
60,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms using radical regulation, by raising business tax rates as high as nearly 50 percent and by taxing family farms again at death by as much as 45 percent, is false.

Answer: 0"
61,"Explanation: The claim that speakers at the Democratic National Convention made zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS is false. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention, several speakers, including Hillary Clinton, addressed the threat of ISIS. For instance, Clinton mentioned ISIS in her acceptance speech, stating, ""We need to be clear-eyed about the threats we face. We face a global terrorist threat from ISIS and other extremist groups."" Therefore, the claim that there were zero mentions of ISIS is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
62,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details that would allow for verification.

Additionally, there is no public record or widely recognized source that supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
63,"Explanation: The claim that the amount of interest paid on the federal debt exceeds total tax revenue is false. According to the U.S. Treasury Department's data, in fiscal year 2021, the total interest paid on the federal debt was approximately $370 billion, while total tax revenue was around $3.5 trillion. Therefore, the interest paid on the federal debt is significantly less than total tax revenue.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
65,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Supreme Court did not decide in 1982 that non-citizen children must get free K-12 education. The landmark case that addressed this issue is Plyler v. Doe (1982), where the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot deny undocumented children access to a free public education. However, the ruling did not specify that non-citizen children must get free K-12 education; it only ensured that they could not be excluded from public schools.

Answer: 0"
66,"Explanation: Donald Trump has consistently opposed a Canadian-style universal healthcare system. He has repeatedly stated his opposition to Medicare for All and has advocated for a market-based approach to healthcare. Therefore, the claim that Donald Trump has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system is false.

Answer: 0"
67,"Explanation: The claim states that the Democrats' proposed budget is balanced by using more new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that the Democrats' budget is balanced solely by new tax revenue. Budgets are typically balanced by a combination of revenue and expenditure, and it is not accurate to suggest that new tax revenue is the primary or sole source of balance.

Answer: 0"
68,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton did not vote for the war in Iraq. She voted against the resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 2002. John McCain, on the other hand, voted in favor of the resolution. Therefore, the claim that Hillary Clinton ""agreed with (John McCain) on voting for the war in Iraq"" is false.

Answer: 0"
69,"Explanation: The claim that ""Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant"" is false. According to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there are 61 nuclear power plants in the United States, and the majority of these plants are located in states with large populations, such as California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. However, the population density around these plants varies, and it is not accurate to say that most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.

Answer: 0"
70,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has doubled its exports under President Barack Obama is not accurate. While exports did increase during his presidency, they did not double. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. exports increased from $1.5 trillion in 2009 to $2.3 trillion in 2016, which is an increase of about 53% over the eight years of his presidency, not a doubling.

Answer: 0"
71,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, also known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission, which was chaired by former Senator Alan Simpson and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, did not recommend converting Medicare to a voucher system. The commission's report, released in 2010, proposed a variety of reforms to Medicare, including raising the eligibility age and reducing benefits, but it did not propose a voucher system.

Answer: 0"
72,"Explanation: The claim that the last time there was a sustained surge of confidence in governments' competence was under Ronald Reagan is not accurate. While Ronald Reagan's presidency did see a period of increased confidence in the U.S. government, particularly in economic matters, this was not the last time such a surge occurred. For instance, the post-World War II era saw a significant surge in confidence in governments' competence, and more recently, the post-2008 financial crisis period has also seen a resurgence of confidence in governments' ability to manage economic recovery and stability. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
73,"Explanation: The claim that Senator Obama has never had a serious Republican challenger is false. Barack Obama, who later became the 44th President of the United States, was a Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. During his time in the Senate, he faced several Republican challengers in his 2008 Senate re-election campaign. The most notable challenger was Alan Keyes, who ran against Obama in the 2004 Senate election and again in 2008. Therefore, the claim that he has never had a serious Republican challenger is incorrect.

76,"Explanation: The claim that the InterLink at T.F. Green Airport is the closest air-rail link in the country is not accurate. While the InterLink is a notable air-rail link, there are other airports in the United States that have closer air-rail connections. For example, the Washington Dulles International Airport has a Metrorail station that is closer to the airport than the InterLink at T.F. Green Airport.

Answer: 0"
77,"Explanation: The claim that the United States alone loses more than 3,000 people a day to cancer is an exaggeration. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2020, an estimated 599,600 people in the United States died from cancer. This means that, on average, about 1,650 people die from cancer each day in the United States. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
78,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific study or data set that is not provided in the question. To verify the claim, one would need to check the latest educational rankings and collective bargaining laws for the states mentioned. However, without specific data or a reliable source, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
79,"Explanation: The claim that the Colorado caucus system for selecting Republican delegates is rigged is a complex issue that has been debated among political observers and participants. The Colorado caucus system involves local precinct meetings where voters select delegates to represent them at the county and state conventions. While there have been allegations of irregularities and concerns about the fairness of the process, there is no widely accepted evidence or consensus that the system is ""rigged"" in a way that systematically disadvantages one group or candidate. The system's rules and procedures are publicly available, and any irregularities are typically investigated by the relevant authorities.

Answer: 0"
80,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every 28 hours an unarmed black person is shot by a cop"" is a misinterpretation of a study conducted by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and the NAACP. The study found that a black person is killed by police every 28 hours, but it does not specify that the person is unarmed. The claim is often used to highlight the disproportionate impact of police violence on the black community, but it is not accurate to say that every 28 hours an unarmed black person is shot by a cop.

Answer: 0"
81,"Explanation: The claim is false. The volume of water flowing into and out of Lake Erie is not constant and does not remain at 137 billion gallons per day for inflow and 86.3 billion gallons per day for outflow. The claim also suggests a net surplus of 50 billion gallons per day, which is not accurate. The actual flow rates of water into and out of Lake Erie vary significantly based on factors such as weather patterns, seasonal changes, and human activities.

Answer: 0"
82,"Explanation: The claim states that San Antonio has seen a 67% growth in water customers in the last 25 years, but there is 0% more water used. This is contradictory because if the number of customers has increased by 67%, it would imply that more water is being used, not the same amount. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
83,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to multiple news reports and official statements, the crowd size at Trump's rally in Phoenix on June 18, 2020, was estimated to be around 15,000 to 20,000 people. This is supported by various sources, including local news outlets and independent fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
84,"Explanation: The claim that abortion services are well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is misleading. According to Planned Parenthood's own data, abortion services account for about 32% of their total services. The remaining services include contraception, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings, and other reproductive health services. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
85,"Explanation: The claim that the climate has been cooling for the last decade is false. Global temperature records show that the last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, with 2016, 2019, and 2020 being the three warmest years ever recorded. This trend is consistent with the long-term warming trend observed over the past century, primarily driven by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.

Answer: 0"
86,"Explanation: The claim about a 50% reduction in accidents and a 60% reduction in injury accidents at the rebuilt Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess the claim, I would need specific data or sources that support these percentages. Without such evidence, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
87,"Explanation: The claim states that the mean income for a family in the state is $57,000.

Answer: 0"
88,"Explanation: The Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian Islamist organization, has been accused of various extremist activities, including support for violence against Israel. However, it is important to note that the Brotherhood has denied these accusations and has stated that it is committed to peaceful means. There is no publicly available evidence that the Muslim Brotherhood has openly declared war on Israel. The claim is based on misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the Brotherhood's statements and actions.

Answer: 0"
89,"Explanation: The claim about the Medicaid fraud rate in Virginia being 0.47 percent is not accurate. The actual fraud rate for Medicaid in Virginia is much higher. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the fraud rate for Virginia's Medicaid program was 1.4 percent in 2019. This discrepancy suggests that the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
90,"Explanation: The claim that the presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution is false. Evolution is a well-established scientific theory that explains how species change over time. Gorillas are a species of great apes that have evolved from a common ancestor with humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos. The existence of gorillas does not contradict the theory of evolution; rather, it is a result of the evolutionary process. The claim seems to misunderstand the relationship between evolution and the diversity of species.

Answer: 0"
91,"Explanation: The claim is false. Milwaukee County did not spend over $170,000 in salaries in 2010 for employees to participate in union activities such as collective bargaining. This information is not supported by any credible sources or official records.

Answer: 0"
95,"Explanation: The claim is false. George Allen, a former U.S. Senator from Virginia, did not vote to add $3 trillion to the federal debt. He voted to raise the debt ceiling four times, but this is a routine vote that occurs when the debt limit is reached and needs to be increased to allow the government to continue borrowing money. Additionally, he voted for the No Child Left Behind Act, which is a true statement. However, the claim that he voted to add $3 trillion to the federal debt is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
96,"Explanation: The claim that the Senate immigration bill is filled with things like rewards for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors, and Vegas casinos is false. The Senate immigration bill, known as the ""Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013,"" did not include such provisions. The bill focused on border security, legalization of undocumented immigrants, and other immigration-related reforms.

Answer: 0"
97,"Explanation: The claim that it makes no difference whether children are raised by heterosexual or homosexual parents is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex nature of family dynamics and child development. While numerous studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents in terms of emotional well-being, academic achievement, and overall development, it is not accurate to say that it makes no difference. The claim ignores the unique experiences and challenges that children in same-sex parent households may face, such as potential stigma, lack of societal acceptance, and the need for additional support. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
98,"Explanation: Wisconsin law does not prevent a candidate from removing their name from the ballot for re-election to Congress. Wisconsin Statutes § 12.01(1) allows candidates to withdraw from a primary or general election by filing a written withdrawal with the appropriate election official. Therefore, the claim that he cannot remove his name from the ballot for re-election to Congress is false.

Answer: 0"
99,"Explanation: The claim suggests that under Governor Mitt Romney's definition, Donald Trump is a small business. However, this claim is misleading because it implies a direct comparison or equivalence between Romney's definition and Trump's business status. Romney's definition of a small business typically refers to businesses with a certain number of employees or annual revenue, which does not directly apply to Trump's business empire. Trump's businesses are large corporations, not small businesses as defined by Romney's criteria.

Answer: 0"
100,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misunderstanding of the Iran nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The agreement does not limit Iran to the number of centrifuges needed for a weapon but rather limits the number of centrifuges Iran can use for its nuclear program. The agreement allows Iran to have a certain number of centrifuges for peaceful purposes, but it also includes strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
101,"Explanation: The claim is false. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama did not attack John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare. In fact, McCain's campaign was the one that proposed cuts to Medicare, and Obama criticized McCain for these proposals. The claim reverses the actual events.

Answer: 0"
102,"Explanation: The claim that Sarah Palin proposed a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf is false. There is no evidence or record of such a proposal by Sarah Palin. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a fabrication of her actual proposal for a wolf hunting bounty, which was $400 for each wolf killed.

Answer: 0"
103,"Explanation: The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) is indeed a significant contributor to water pollution in the Milwaukee area. The district's combined sewer overflows (CSOs) have been a major source of pollution in Lake Michigan, particularly during heavy rainfall events. The MMSD has been working on projects to reduce these overflows and improve water quality, but it remains a significant issue.

Answer: 1"
104,"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is solid through about 2040 without any changes whatsoever is false. The Social Security Administration has reported that the program's trust funds will be depleted by 2034, and the program will only be able to pay 75% of its benefits after that point. This is due to the increasing number of retirees and the decreasing number of workers paying into the system. The Social Security Administration has also stated that changes will be needed to ensure the program's long-term solvency.

Answer: 0"
105,"Explanation: The claim that if you are from Guatemala and are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed, is not accurate. While it is true that Mexico has strict immigration policies and illegal entry can result in detention, the claim that this automatically leads to jail time is an oversimplification. Detention centers are often used for processing and deportation, but not all individuals are jailed indefinitely. The process involves legal proceedings and the possibility of release on bail or other conditions.

Answer: 0"
106,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no significant oil drilling activity off the coast of Virginia. The U.S. has been focusing on reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy sources. Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a moratorium on new offshore oil and gas leasing in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, including the waters off the coast of Virginia.

Answer: 0"
107,"Explanation: According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Texas is approximately $1.7 trillion, which makes it the second-largest economy in the United States. However, when comparing Texas to other countries, it ranks 10th in the world based on GDP. Therefore, the claim that Texas has the 15th largest economy in the world is false.

Answer: 0"
108,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about which institutions are being referred to and what their exact control over the capital is. Without specific names of institutions and clear evidence of their control over two-thirds of the capital, it is impossible to verify the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
109,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama wants to raise the lowest income tax rate from 10 to 15 percent is false. During his presidency, President Obama proposed a tax plan that included raising the top income tax rate for the wealthiest Americans, but he did not propose raising the lowest income tax rate. In fact, his administration focused on reducing the tax burden for low- and middle-income Americans.

Answer: 0"
110,"Explanation: The claim that all travelers, including babies, arriving in the U.S. by air must have a passport is false. While it is true that U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) must have a passport or other acceptable identification to enter the U.S., there are exceptions for minors. Children under 16 can enter the U.S. with a valid passport or a certified copy of their birth certificate. However, children under 16 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian who has a valid passport or other acceptable identification.

Answer: 0"
111,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual's fundraising performance and cash on hand compared to other political figures. To verify this claim, we would need access to reliable and up-to-date political fundraising data. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
112,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, federal spending as a percentage of GDP was 20.7% in 2020, and federal revenues as a percentage of GDP were 15.3% in the same year. The claim exaggerates the spending and understates the revenues.

Answer: 0"
113,"Explanation: The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
114,"Explanation: The claim that tailpipe emissions rules, if fully implemented, will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit by 2050 is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. Tailpipe emissions regulations are part of broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, but their impact on temperature rise is not as precise as the claim suggests. The reduction in temperature rise would be more significant in terms of preventing further warming rather than a specific reduction of nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit by 2050.

Answer: 0"
115,"Explanation: Michael Thurmond is a former Georgia State Senator and has indeed authored legislation that has provided tax relief to Georgia's senior citizens and working families. The specific legislation he authored, known as the ""Georgia Taxpayer Relief Act,"" has resulted in significant tax reductions for these groups. The claim that this legislation has provided more than $250 million in tax relief is accurate based on the information available.

Answer: 1"
116,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama's parents were communists is false. Barack Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr., was a Kenyan economist who was not a communist. He was a member of the Kenya African National Union (KANU), a political party that was not aligned with communism. The claim is a misinformation that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
117,"Explanation: The claim states that none of the $400 million proposed by the City of Austin for road projects will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways. This claim is false because the city's proposal includes plans to add new lanes to certain congested roadways. The proposal is designed to address traffic congestion and improve mobility, which inherently involves adding new lanes to some roadways.

Answer: 0"
118,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain accused Barack Obama of ""letting infants die"" is false. During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, John McCain did criticize Barack Obama's stance on abortion, but he did not accuse him of letting infants die. The claim is a misrepresentation of McCain's actual statements.

Answer: 0"
119,"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown voted six times to raise his own pay is false. Sherrod Brown is a U.S. Senator from Ohio, and senators' salaries are set by law and are not determined by individual votes. The salary for a U.S. Senator is currently $174,000 per year, and this amount is set by Congress as a whole, not by individual senators voting on their own pay.

Answer: 0"
120,"Explanation: The claim is false. The latest unemployment numbers do not indicate that nearly 315,000 Americans have given up hope when it comes to finding a job. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports the unemployment rate, which is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The number of people who are unemployed is a subset of the labor force, and it does not include those who have given up looking for work. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the unemployment data.

Answer: 0"
121,"Explanation: The claim that the changes to Georgia's tax and fee structure are an overall tax cut is not accurate. While there may be specific tax cuts or reductions in certain areas, the overall impact on the tax burden can vary depending on individual circumstances and the specific changes made. Therefore, it is not accurate to label the entire tax and fee structure change as an overall tax cut.

Answer: 0"
122,"Explanation: The claim that gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years is based on a study conducted by the Pew Research Center. The study found that the number of gun homicides in the U.S. decreased from 18,255 in 2006 to 9,663 in 2018, a decrease of 47%. This is a significant reduction, but the claim states a 49% decrease, which is slightly inaccurate. Therefore, the claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate.

Answer: 1"
123,"Explanation: The claim that ""there's no money in Social Security"" is false. Social Security is a federal program in the United States that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible individuals. The program is funded through payroll taxes and is managed by the Social Security Administration. According to the Social Security Administration's website, the program has a significant amount of money in its trust funds, which are used to pay benefits to current beneficiaries.

Answer: 0"
124,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney and his staff purchased computer hard drives for $100,000 is false. The actual cost of the hard drives was $1,000, not $100,000. This misinformation likely stems from a misunderstanding or deliberate exaggeration of the actual cost.

Answer: 0"
125,"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 0/1"
126,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican-led softening of firearms training rules does not mean that untrained individuals would be allowed to carry guns with a state permit. The claim misrepresents the actual changes in the rules. The changes typically involve reducing the number of hours required for training or allowing for online training, but they still require some form of training before an individual can obtain a permit to carry a gun.

Answer: 0"
127,"Explanation: The claim that the study stating more than 70 percent of the traffic on the Sellwood Bridge is to/from Clackamas County has been thoroughly debunked by The Oregonian is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. The Oregonian has not published any article debunking this study.

Answer: 0"
128,"Explanation: The claim that if all of the Bush-era tax cuts expire on schedule, the budget will be close to being balanced in four years, is based on a simplified economic model. However, it does not account for several factors that could affect the budget balance, such as changes in economic growth, inflation, and potential adjustments to other tax policies or spending programs. Additionally, the expiration of tax cuts would likely have a significant impact on individual and corporate tax liabilities, which could lead to economic adjustments that might not result in a balanced budget within four years. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and cannot be considered entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
129,"Explanation: The claim that children do best with a mom and a dad is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex nature of family structures and their impact on child development. Research in social sciences has shown that various family structures, including single-parent households, same-sex parent households, and blended families, can also provide a nurturing and supportive environment for children. The well-being of children is more closely tied to factors such as parental involvement, economic stability, and emotional support, rather than the specific gender composition of their parents.

Answer: 0"
130,"Explanation: The claim states that from May 5 to May 9, 1,100 soldiers committed suicide, with one suicide every 36 hours. This claim is false because it is not possible for 1,100 soldiers to commit suicide in just 5 days. The average number of soldiers committing suicide per day would be 220, which is an unrealistic and unsustainable figure. Additionally, the claim does not provide any credible source or evidence to support the statement.

Answer: 0"
131,"Explanation: The claim that you sponsored the new Buy American law is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that you have sponsored or been involved in the creation of the Buy American law. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or a false statement.

Answer: 0"
132,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was funded through a combination of revenue sources, including a tax on high-income individuals, a tax on medical device manufacturers, and cuts to Medicare provider payments. The claim that funding the ACA without a tax hike would require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget is not supported by facts. The ACA's funding mechanisms were designed to be revenue-neutral, meaning the costs were offset by the new revenue sources.

Answer: 0"
133,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Assembly did not vote to take funding away from public schools to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools. The voucher program is funded separately from the state's general education funding, and the Assembly's budget decisions do not directly impact the funding for public schools or private voucher schools.

Answer: 0"
134,"Explanation: The claim is false. Joe Straus, who served as the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives from 2009 to 2019, was not acknowledged or thanked by Planned Parenthood for his efforts. In fact, Straus was known for his opposition to abortion rights and supported various anti-abortion measures during his tenure.

Answer: 0"
135,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Scott Walker has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been consistently lower than the national average during Walker's tenure as governor. In fact, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been below the national average since 2010, and it has not been in the top 2 for job losses.

Answer: 0"
136,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio today has the fewest number of state employees since the Reagan administration is difficult to verify without specific data. However, it is important to note that the number of state employees can fluctuate due to various factors such as budget cuts, economic conditions, and changes in government policies. Without concrete data or a reliable source, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0"
137,"Explanation: The claim that this is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression is based on the comparison of the current economic recovery to the period following the Great Depression. While the current recovery has been slow and uneven, it is not accurate to say it is the worst since the Great Depression. The Great Depression was characterized by a much more severe and prolonged economic downturn, with unemployment rates reaching over 25% in the United States. In contrast, the current recovery has seen unemployment rates peak at around 14.8% in April 2020 and has since been declining. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
138,"Explanation: The claim is asking whether the governor of Massachusetts should be able to appoint an interim U.S. senator. In the United States, the appointment of a U.S. senator is typically made by the state's governor, but this appointment is usually for a temporary period until a special election can be held. The claim does not specify the context or the reason for the appointment, so it is not possible to definitively say whether the governor should be able to make this appointment. However, the general practice is that governors can appoint interim senators, so the claim is not necessarily false.

Answer: 1"
139,"Explanation: The claim is false. Voting instructions provided to voters in elections typically include information about the limitations of the master lever, also known as the ""straight ticket"" option. This option allows voters to cast their vote for all candidates of a particular party with a single mark. The instructions usually specify that this option does not include all candidates or that it may not be available for all races. Therefore, the claim that there is nothing in the voting instructions about the limitations of the master lever is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
140,"Explanation: The claim ""On raising taxes"" is incomplete and lacks specific context. Without additional information about the source, the topic, or the specific tax being raised, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: N/A"
141,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) does not have a ""slush fund"" for spaying and neutering pets. The Affordable Care Act is a healthcare reform law that primarily focuses on expanding access to health insurance and improving the quality of healthcare services. There is no provision in the law that allows for the use of funds for pet spaying and neutering, nor is there any evidence to suggest that such a program has been implemented or funded through the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
142,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but misleading. During George W. Bush's administration, the U.S. experienced a significant economic downturn, including the Great Recession, which led to a loss of millions of jobs per month. However, the claim does not specify the exact time frame, which could be misleading. Under Barack Obama's administration, the U.S. did experience a period of job growth, with hundreds of thousands of jobs added per month during the recovery period. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of job growth under Obama, it is misleading in its comparison to the Bush administration without specifying the time frame.

Answer: 0"
143,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statistic about the education level of adults in Georgia. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or other reputable educational statistics databases. Without direct access to these sources, I cannot confirm the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0/1"
144,"Explanation: The claim ""On mandating health care coverage"" is incomplete and lacks specific context. It could refer to various situations, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States, which mandates health insurance coverage for most Americans, or other similar policies in different countries. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
145,"Explanation: The claim that Ron Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas is false. Ron Johnson, a former CEO of J.C. Penney and a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has been known to support various economic policies, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he voted five times for tax breaks specifically designed to help companies move jobs overseas. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his voting record.

Answer: 0"
146,"Explanation: The claim that the individual led the effort to build a new engineering campus for the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in Wauwatosa is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific mention of the individual's role in the project, and without additional context or verification, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
147,"Explanation: The claim that taxpayers pay $18,000 a month for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco is false. The U.S. House of Representatives does not provide monthly figures for individual members' district offices. The cost of maintaining a district office is typically funded through campaign funds and not directly from taxpayers. Additionally, the claim does not provide a source or citation to support the $18,000 figure.

Answer: 0"
148,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that reducing obesity rates to 1980 levels would directly translate to a trillion dollars saved in Medicare costs. However, this is a simplification that overlooks several factors. Obesity is just one of many factors contributing to healthcare costs, and reducing obesity rates would not necessarily lead to a direct trillion-dollar savings. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential costs of implementing and maintaining a program to reduce obesity rates to 1980 levels. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
149,"Explanation: The claim is about the additional cost of a surcharge on student loans. However, the claim does not specify which surcharge is being referred to, nor does it provide any context or source for the figures. Without this information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
150,"Explanation: The claim that a federal plan to expand Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over 10 years is based on a study conducted by the Florida Policy Institute. The study estimated that the expansion of Medicaid in Florida would cost the state $26 billion over a decade. However, this cost is not borne solely by Florida taxpayers; it is a shared responsibility between the federal government and the state. The federal government would cover a significant portion of the costs, with the state contributing a smaller amount. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of the total cost, it is misleading to attribute the entire $26 billion to Florida taxpayers.

Answer: 0"
151,"Explanation: The claim that African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do is supported by numerous studies and reports. For instance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics has shown that African-Americans are arrested at a higher rate than whites for similar offenses. Additionally, studies have found that African-Americans are more likely to receive harsher sentences, even for similar crimes. This disparity is often attributed to systemic biases in the criminal justice system.

Answer: 1"
152,"Explanation: Wisconsin does allow voters to change their early ballot if they realize they've made a mistake. This process is known as ""curing"" the ballot. The voter can contact their local clerk's office to request a replacement ballot. The original ballot is then voided, and the voter can cast a new one.

153,"Explanation: The claim that Kurt Schrader cast the deciding vote that failed to extend tax cuts for Oregon's middle-class families and small businesses is false. Kurt Schrader, a Democratic representative from Oregon, voted against the tax cut extension, but he did not cast the deciding vote. The deciding vote was cast by another representative, and the bill ultimately failed due to a lack of support from Democrats.

Answer: 0"
154,"Explanation: The claim about Governor Scott Walker openly backing a move to abolish the state retirement system and convert it to a 401(k)-style plan, which would reduce pensions by at least a third for current and retired public employees, is false. While Governor Walker has proposed changes to the state's retirement system, including a shift towards a 401(k)-style plan, he has not openly backed a move that would reduce pensions by at least a third. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresentation of his actual proposals.

Answer: 0"
155,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) does indeed limit the enrichment of uranium to the five recognized nuclear weapon states (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States). The treaty allows these states to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, but it also requires them to limit the spread of nuclear weapons technology to other countries. Non-nuclear weapon states are required to accept safeguards on their nuclear activities to ensure they are not developing nuclear weapons.

Answer: 1"
156,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Jeff Merkley voted six times for more debt is not accurate. As of my last update, there is no specific record of Sen. Merkley voting six times for more debt.

Answer: 0"
157,"Explanation: The claim that Congress has cut funding for veterans benefits over the last years is not accurate. In fact, the U.S. government has been increasing funding for veterans benefits. For instance, the VA budget has been increasing in recent years, with the 2021 budget being the largest in history. Additionally, the VA has been receiving additional funding through various legislative measures, such as the VA Mission Act and the VA Maintain Act, which aim to improve veterans' healthcare and benefits.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truth of this statement based on available information.

Answer: 0"
159,"Explanation: The claim that ""fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges these days can't find jobs"" is not supported by reliable data. While it is true that liberal arts graduates may face challenges in the job market, the specific percentage of 53% is not widely reported or verified by credible sources. According to various studies and reports, the unemployment rate for liberal arts graduates is generally lower than the claim suggests, and the majority of graduates do find employment, often in fields related to their interests and skills.

Answer: 0"
161,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has led the nation in student fatalities caused by motorists illegally passing stopped school buses is not accurate. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Georgia does not consistently rank as the state with the highest number of student fatalities due to motorists illegally passing stopped school buses. The NHTSA's data shows that other states, such as California and Texas, have higher rates of such incidents. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
162,"Explanation: The claim is based on an estimate from Governing magazine, which is a reputable source for public policy and management news. The magazine has indeed reported that in states that have not expanded Medicaid, a significant number of rural hospitals are at risk of closing.

Answer: 1"
163,"Explanation: The claim that Florida Democrats put your Social Security number and your wife's Employment Identification Number in a mail piece is highly unlikely. There is no legitimate reason for a political party to use personal identification numbers in a mail piece, and it would be illegal and unethical to do so.

Answer: 0"
164,"Explanation: The claim that Oregon ranks 30th in the nation with regard to its incarceration rate can be evaluated by checking the latest data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics or the Prison Policy Initiative. As of the latest available data, Oregon's incarceration rate is indeed relatively low compared to other states, but the exact ranking can vary slightly depending on the specific year and methodology used. However, the claim that Oregon ranks 30th specifically is not supported by the most recent data.

Answer: 0"

166,"Explanation: The claim that ""creeping defense commitments in (the Middle East) and globally now consume over half the U.S. discretionary budget annually"" is misleading. While it is true that the U.S. spends a significant portion of its discretionary budget on defense, the claim that it consumes over half is an exaggeration. According to the latest data from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the defense budget is around 15-20% of the discretionary budget, not over half. The claim also does not specify the time period or the source of the data, making it difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
167,"Explanation: The claim is false. Politicians and corporate lobbyists do not have the power to take away an individual's right to spend their paycheck as they wish. The government can impose taxes and regulations, but these are not the same as taking away the right to spend money. The claim is a misinterpretation of the role of government and corporate influence.

Answer: 0"
168,"Explanation: The claim that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act is not accurate. While polls have shown that a majority of Latinos support the DREAM Act, the exact percentage varies. For instance, a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Latinos supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which includes the DREAM Act. However, the claim that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act is an exaggeration. Additionally, Marco Rubio has expressed support for the DREAM Act in the past, but he has also opposed certain aspects of it, such as the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Therefore, the claim that Marco Rubio opposes the DREAM Act is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
169,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005. In a speech, he said, ""If the Islamic Republic of Iran decides to use its nuclear power, it will be for the benefit of the entire world."" He did not explicitly threaten to use a nuclear weapon against Israel or the United States. The claim misrepresents his statement and exaggerates his intentions.

Answer: 0"
170,"Explanation: Bill McCollum is a former U.S. Representative from Florida, not Arizona. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2011.

Answer: 0"
171,"Explanation: The claim that there are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea is false.

172,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island's graduated driving license has saved hundreds of lives is not verifiable with specific data or studies. While graduated licensing programs are known to reduce crashes and fatalities among young drivers, the exact number of lives saved by Rhode Island's specific program is not provided in the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim as true based on the information given.

Answer: 0"
173,"Explanation: The claim states that the Wisconsin unemployment rate was higher than the U.S. rate during only three months when Mary Burke was state commerce secretary. To verify this claim, we would need to compare the unemployment rates for Wisconsin and the U.S. during the period when Mary Burke held the position. However, without specific data or a reliable source to cross-reference, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional data.)"
174,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia lawmakers ""fuel up for the session by feasting on wild hogs"" is a humorous and exaggerated statement. While it is possible that lawmakers might consume wild hog meat as part of their diet, the claim is not a factual representation of a common practice or official policy. It is more likely to be a humorous or satirical reference rather than a true statement about their dietary habits.

Answer: 0"
175,"Explanation: The claim states that Will Rasmussen falsely claimed he had lived in the West Linn district for about a year. Without specific evidence or context, it's difficult to definitively verify the truth of this claim.

178,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the resources of a Democratic campaign for Florida governor in the current election cycle to previous cycles. Without specific data or historical context, it's impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false. However, it's important to note that political campaigns can vary greatly in terms of resources, and it's not uncommon for campaigns to have significant resources early in the election cycle.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific data.)"
179,"Explanation: The claim about the error rates for the Fulton County elections department being well below the average is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess this claim, one would need specific data on the error rates for Fulton County and a comparison with the average error rates for other counties or the national average. Without such data, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
180,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a significant portion of prisoners are incarcerated for less than a year, and that some are locked up for not paying child support. While it is true that some people are incarcerated for short periods, the claim that ""a little less than half"" of prisoners are in for less than a year is not supported by reliable data. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2019, about 40% of state prisoners were sentenced to less than a year. However, the claim that ""we are locking them up in the state pen"" for not paying child support is misleading, as child support violations typically result in fines or other penalties, not jail time.

Answer: 0"
181,"Explanation: The Tennessee Constitution does not explicitly prohibit a state income tax. While it does not mention a state income tax, it also does not prohibit it. The Tennessee Constitution does not have a provision that directly states there should not be a state income tax.

182,"Explanation: The claim that quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl MVP more than 50 percent of the time is false. According to the NFL, quarterbacks have won the MVP award 28 times out of 55 Super Bowl MVPs, which is approximately 50.91%. However, this percentage is not more than 50 percent.

Answer: 0"
183,"Explanation: The claim that this is the slowest job recovery since Hoover is comparing the current job recovery to the period following the Great Depression under President Herbert Hoover. The Great Depression was a severe economic crisis that lasted from 1929 to 1939, and the job recovery during that time was indeed very slow. However, the current job recovery, following the COVID-19 pandemic, has been slower than the recovery after the Great Recession of 2008, but not necessarily slower than the recovery after the Great Depression. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as it stands.

Answer: 0"
184,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his stance on abortion over time. In 2012, during his presidential campaign, Romney stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. However, in 2015, he stated that he would support a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, but also added that he would support exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. This change in stance is often referred to as a ""flip-flop"" by political opponents.

186,"Explanation: The claim that a transportation plan would make Virginia the first state in the nation to eliminate the state tax on gasoline is false.

While some states have reduced or eliminated certain taxes, Virginia has not done so. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
187,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin women are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job is a misinterpretation of the gender wage gap. The gender wage gap refers to the difference in earnings between men and women, and it is often expressed as a percentage. In Wisconsin, the gender wage gap is approximately 81 cents on the dollar, meaning that women earn about 81% of what men earn for the same job. This is a common statistic used to illustrate the gender wage gap, but it does not mean that women are paid 81 cents for every dollar a man earns.

Therefore, the claim that Steve Santarsiero wrote PAs Gun Safety Law is true.

Answer: 1"
189,"Explanation: Common Core State Standards (CCSS) are not a federal mandate. They were developed by the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers, and they were adopted voluntarily by individual states. The federal government did not impose these standards on states. The misconception likely arises from the fact that the federal government provided funding and incentives for states to adopt these standards through programs like Race to the Top.

Answer: 0"
190,"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee's police chief can fire officers for ""basically no cause"" is false. In the United States, police officers, like other public employees, are typically protected by civil service laws that provide due process rights. This means that an officer cannot be fired without cause, and the process for termination must include a hearing and the opportunity for the officer to present their case. The specific laws and procedures can vary by jurisdiction, but the general principle of due process applies.

Answer: 0"
191,"Explanation: The claim that you cannot build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia is false. While it is true that Saudi Arabia is an Islamic state and the practice of Christianity is restricted, there are no outright prohibitions against building churches. However, the construction of churches is subject to strict regulations and requires special permission from the government. Additionally, there are no public Christian churches in Saudi Arabia, but private worship services can be held in homes or other private spaces with the appropriate permits.

Answer: 0"
192,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does not estimate that the average cost to every family of four from cap and trade will be $6,800 per year. The CBO has estimated the cost of a cap-and-trade program on households, but the figures are not as high as claimed. For example, in a 2019 report, the CBO estimated that a cap-and-trade program could increase the cost of living for a family of four by $1,000 to $2,000 per year, depending on the specific design of the program.

Answer: 0"
193,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal government does not spend $46,000 a year per family. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the federal government's spending on various programs. The claim also suggests that reducing spending to $30,000 per family would balance the budget, which is not accurate as the budget deficit is influenced by many factors, not just per-family spending.

Answer: 0"
194,"Explanation: The claim that the Pentagon made up the heroics of POW Jessica Lynch is false. Jessica Lynch was indeed captured and held by Iraqi forces in 2003. Her rescue was a real event, and the Pentagon did not fabricate her story. The initial reports of her heroics were later corrected due to new information, but the basic facts of her capture and rescue were accurate.

Answer: 0"
195,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent is false. The U.S. has a significant military presence in Africa, with operations and bases in various countries. For instance, the U.S. has military operations in Somalia, Djibouti, Kenya, and other nations, often in support of counter-terrorism efforts and regional stability. Additionally, the U.S. has military advisors and trainers in several African countries. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
196,"Explanation: The claim is based on a projection that mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt will consume the entire budget in a few decades. While it is true that these programs are significant and their costs are projected to increase, it is not accurate to say that they will ""eclipse"" the entire budget. The U.S. budget includes many other categories, such as defense, education, and infrastructure, which are not mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame or the exact percentage of the budget that these programs will consume, making it difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
197,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the Tax Policy Center, which analyzed the impact of Donald Trump's tax plan. The study found that the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would indeed receive more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent combined. This is because the tax plan proposed by Trump included significant reductions in the top marginal tax rate and the elimination of the estate tax, which primarily benefited high-income individuals.

Answer: 1"
198,"Explanation: The claim is false. PolitiFact does not rank governors based on the number of lies they have told. Instead, they rate the accuracy of individual statements made by politicians, including governors. The claim that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin was listed as the governor who told the most lies is incorrect, as PolitiFact does not provide such a ranking. Additionally, the claim that Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of ""Lie-en Governors"" is also false, as Politifact does not use such a ranking system.

Answer: 0"
199,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's speeches to school children spread socialist ideology is false. President Obama's speeches to school children were primarily focused on encouraging students to stay in school, work hard, and pursue their dreams.

Answer: 0"
200,"Explanation: The claim that the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton's presidency was a hundred times what it was under President Ronald Reagan is false. While Bill Clinton's presidency saw significant economic growth and job creation, the claim of a hundred times the job creation and poverty reduction under Ronald Reagan is an exaggeration. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy created about 22.5 million jobs during Clinton's presidency, while under Reagan, the economy created about 16.5 million jobs. Additionally, the poverty rate decreased from 15.2% in 1993 to 12.7% in 2000 during Clinton's presidency, while under Reagan, the poverty rate decreased from 15.2% in 1980 to 12.8% in 1989. The claim of a hundred times the job creation and poverty reduction is not supported by the data.

Answer: 0"
201,"Explanation: The claim about Bill McCollum voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs is not supported by any credible sources or historical records. There is no evidence to suggest that McCollum voted on such an amendment. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
202,"Explanation: The claim is false. John McCain, a Republican Senator and former presidential candidate, was known for his criticism of President George W. Bush on certain issues, particularly regarding the Iraq War. McCain was a strong advocate for the surge in Iraq and supported the war, but he also criticized the administration's handling of the war and its aftermath. Therefore, the claim that McCain was in total agreement and support of President Bush on the most important issues of their day is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
203,"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama did not make this specific promise during his 2008 presidential campaign. Instead, he proposed a plan to reduce the deficit by $1 trillion over 10 years, which was not achieved by the end of his first term. The claim misrepresents his actual statements and the timeline of his deficit reduction plan.

Answer: 0"
204,"Explanation: The claim suggests that improving third-graders' reading skills can have a significant impact on various aspects of their lives, including graduation rates and incarceration rates. This claim is supported by numerous studies and educational research. For instance, research has shown that students who read at grade level by the end of third grade are more likely to graduate from high school and less likely to be involved in the criminal justice system. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
205,"Explanation: The claim is true. There are indeed several elected state officials who have opened their homes to children in need of loving families. This is often part of initiatives to promote adoption and foster care. For example, in some states, elected officials have participated in programs like ""Adopt a Child"" or similar initiatives to encourage more families to consider adoption.

Answer: 1"
206,"Explanation: Rhode Island is indeed one of the states that uses E-Verify, a system that allows employers to check the immigration status of their employees.

Answer: 0"
207,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of people becoming eligible for entitlement programs each day is not 10,000. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the fact that the baby boomer generation is large and many of them are reaching the age of eligibility for programs like Social Security and Medicare.

Answer: 0"
208,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has been challenged in court multiple times, but the Supreme Court has ruled on it twice. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the individual mandate was constitutional. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in California v. Texas that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but the rest of the ACA remained intact. Therefore, the claim that ""three courts have found the new health care law constitutional and two have found it unconstitutional"" is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
209,"Explanation: The claim that the proposed mine in northern Wisconsin would be built without any government oversight is false. In the United States, mining operations are subject to various regulations and oversight by federal and state agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and state departments of natural resources. Additionally, the claim that the mine would be nine miles long is not supported by any credible sources or official documents.

Answer: 0"
210,"Explanation: The claim that car insurance rates have decreased in New Jersey due to market-based solutions attracting more auto insurers is not supported by reliable data or sources. While it is true that the number of auto insurers in New Jersey has increased over the past decade, this does not necessarily correlate with a decrease in insurance rates. Insurance rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including the cost of claims, the risk profile of drivers, and regulatory environments. Without specific data or studies to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
211,"Explanation: The claim that energy companies spend 0.25 percent on research and development (RD) is not accurate. The actual percentage of revenue spent on RD by energy companies varies widely and is typically much higher than 0.25 percent. For example, in 2020, ExxonMobil spent approximately 1.5 percent of its revenue on RD, while Shell spent around 1.2 percent. These figures are more representative of the industry's investment in RD.

Answer: 0"
212,"Explanation: Rick Perry, a former Governor of Texas and a candidate for the Republican nomination for President in 2012, has publicly stated that he does not support a federal minimum wage. He has argued that the minimum wage should be set at the state or local level, rather than by the federal government. Therefore, the claim that Rick Perry does not think there should be a federal minimum wage is true.

Answer: 1"
213,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the business establishment growth in Wisconsin under two different administrations. To verify this claim, we would need to look at the specific data for business establishment growth in Wisconsin during the time periods mentioned. However, without access to the exact data, we cannot definitively confirm the claim. Therefore, we cannot accurately judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
214,"Explanation: The claim is false.

This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of the actual policy or statement made by Chafee or Democrats.

Answer: 0"
215,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a statement made by Donald Trump during his presidency. In a 2019 interview with Fox News, Trump was asked about the U.S.'s commitment to NATO allies. He responded by saying, ""We are spending a tremendous amount of money on NATO. We are protecting countries that are not paying their fair share. We are protecting countries that are not paying their fair share. We are protecting countries that are not paying their fair share."" This statement was widely reported and is a verified part of his public record. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 0"
219,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the financial situation of households in Rhode Island. While it is possible that 25% of households in Rhode Island are either unbanked or rely on high-cost financial services, this claim lacks specific sources or data to support it. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
220,"Explanation: The claim about Wisconsin's finances being on track for a budget surplus this year is based on the state's fiscal year 2021-2022 budget, which was approved in June 2021. The budget projected a surplus of $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ending in June 2022. However, this projection was made before the COVID-19 pandemic's full impact on the state's economy was known. The actual fiscal year 2021-2022 ended with a surplus of $1.1 billion, which was less than the projected surplus. Therefore, while Wisconsin did have a surplus, the claim that it is ""on track"" for a budget surplus this year is not accurate as it was based on a projection that did not fully account for the economic impact of the pandemic.

Answer: 0"
221,"Explanation: The claim that every statewide candidate drawing over 43 percent of the vote in a Republican Texas primary won the resulting runoff is not entirely accurate. While it is true that candidates who received over 43 percent of the vote in the primary often had a significant advantage in the runoff, it is not a guarantee that they would win. There have been instances where candidates with over 43 percent of the vote in the primary did not win the runoff. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
222,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that members of the military have sent him more campaign contributions than they sent President Barack Obama and more than twice what they sent other Republican presidential candidates is not accurate. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual figures. It is important to verify the source and the context of the claim to ensure its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
223,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. military's active-duty personnel has increased by approximately 30,000 since the current president took office in 2017. The claim of adding close to 68,000 troops is an exaggeration. The increase in the military's size is a result of the National Defense Strategy and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018, which authorized an increase in the size of the military.

Answer: 0"
224,"Explanation: President Barack Obama did raise taxes during his presidency. He signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law in 2010, which included a 3.8% tax on net investment income for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. Additionally, he implemented a 0.9% Medicare tax on wages and salaries for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. Therefore, the claim that President Obama has not raised taxes is false.

Answer: 0"
225,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump called pregnant employees an inconvenience is false. There is no credible evidence or verified statement from Donald Trump that supports this claim. The misinformation likely stems from a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of his comments about the Affordable Care Act, which he has criticized for requiring employers to provide certain health benefits, including maternity care.

Answer: 0"
226,"Explanation: The claim is a general statement and does not provide specific data or evidence to support the assertion that no jobs are being created in the state. Without concrete information, it is impossible to definitively judge the claim as true or false. Therefore, the claim is ambiguous and cannot be accurately evaluated as either true or false based on the information provided.

227,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world is not accurate. While the U.S. does have a high concentration of scientists and engineers, particularly in certain regions like Silicon Valley and the Boston area, it does not have the highest concentration globally. Countries like Israel and Singapore have higher densities of scientists and engineers per capita and per square mile. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
228,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for low- to moderate-income working individuals and families. To be eligible, individuals must meet certain criteria, including having earned income and meeting income limits. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for the EITC because they do not have a valid Social Security number, which is required to claim the credit. Additionally, the claim that they can receive up to $36,000 to $38,000 without paying a dime is misleading, as the EITC is a refundable credit, meaning it can reduce the amount of tax owed or result in a refund, but it does not provide a guaranteed amount of money without any tax liability.

231,"Explanation: The claim that Abraham Lincoln was planning to send all freed slaves to Central America after the Civil War is a myth. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and his support for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, are well-documented. There is no historical evidence to support the claim that Lincoln had plans to deport freed slaves to Central America. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of Lincoln's views on Reconstruction and the future of the former slaves.

Answer: 0"
234,"Explanation: The claim that subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies and that cutting these subsidies would save the U.S. government $45 billion every year is misleading. While it is true that oil and gas companies receive significant subsidies, the percentage of total federal subsidies they receive is not 88%. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), oil and gas subsidies in the U.S. are around 10% of total federal subsidies. Additionally, the claim that cutting these subsidies would save $45 billion annually is an oversimplification and not accurate. The actual savings would depend on various factors, including the specific subsidies being cut and their impact on the economy.

Answer: 0"
235,"Explanation: The claim states that if elected, the person would be the first Mayor who lives east of 82nd.

Answer: 0"
236,"Explanation: The claim states that $15 million dollars went to ""build a bigger, better airport"" for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska, with a population of 165. However, there is no credible source provided to verify this claim. Additionally, the population of Ouzinkie is indeed small, making the allocation of such a large sum for an airport project seem disproportionate and unlikely. Therefore, without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is reasonable to conclude that this claim is false.

Answer: 0"
237,"Explanation: President Obama did not explicitly pledge to be transparent throughout the health care reform negotiations. While he did emphasize the importance of transparency and public input during the process, there is no specific pledge that he broke.

Answer: 0"
238,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama administration did not provide Pennsylvania with $160 million to pay for health insurance plans that cover any legal abortion. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require states to cover abortion services with federal funds. Pennsylvania, like other states, has the option to include abortion coverage in its Medicaid program, but this is a state decision and not funded by the federal government.

Answer: 0"
239,"Explanation: The claim that nearly 100 percent of kids in New Orleans are in charter schools is not accurate. According to the Education Week Research Center, as of 2021, approximately 88% of students in New Orleans attend charter schools. This figure is high but not 100%.

240,"Explanation: The claim that the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was, but needs only one-tenth of the workers, is misleading. While it is true that the steel industry has become more efficient and automated over time, leading to a decrease in the number of workers needed, the production levels have not remained constant. The steel industry has faced significant fluctuations in production due to economic cycles, trade policies, and other factors. Therefore, the claim that production levels are the same as they ever were is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
241,"Explanation: The claim that Austin is the largest city in the U.S. or Texas with no geographic representation on its city council is false.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), as of 2021, the proven coal reserves in the United States were estimated to be around 237 billion short tons. In contrast, Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves were estimated to be around 266 billion barrels. Since 1 barrel of oil is equivalent to approximately 6.22 barrels of coal, the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia are significantly higher than the coal reserves in the United States.

Answer: 0"
244,"Explanation: The claim that over half of the people who would be taxed under a millionaire surtax are small businesspeople is not accurate.

The Senate voted on a bipartisan bill to address gun violence, including mental health provisions, on June 21, 2022. The bill passed with 68 votes in favor, which is less than 90. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"

249,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan, a former Speaker of the House, has been critical of President Biden's policies, including Medicare, but the claim that he attacked the president for the same amount of Medicare savings that he had in his own budget is a misrepresentation. Ryan's budget proposals did not directly target Medicare savings in the same way that the claim suggests. The claim is a distortion of Ryan's actual positions and policies.

Answer: 1"
252,"Explanation: The 2005 Energy Policy Act, also known as the Energy Bill of 2005, was a significant piece of legislation that aimed to address various aspects of energy policy in the United States. While it included provisions for renewable energy, such as tax credits for wind and solar power, it also expanded the use of nuclear power and promoted the development of liquefied natural gas. Critics argue that the bill was not a significant step forward for clean, renewable energy due to its emphasis on nuclear and natural gas. Therefore, the claim that the 2005 energy bill was a big step backwards on the path to clean, renewable energy is a matter of perspective and interpretation.

Answer: 0"
253,"Explanation: The claim that abortions are decreasing is generally true. According to the Guttmacher Institute, the abortion rate in the United States has been declining since the mid-1980s. In 2019, the abortion rate was at its lowest since 1973, the year Roe v. Wade was decided. This trend is consistent with data from other countries as well, where abortion rates have been decreasing over time.

Answer: 0"
258,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt is misleading. While the Affordable Care Act did increase the federal deficit in the short term, it also reduced the deficit in the long term. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the ACA would reduce the deficit by $145 billion over the 2016-2025 period. Additionally, the ACA has not significantly contributed to the national debt. The national debt is primarily driven by factors such as tax cuts, spending on defense and social programs, and economic downturns.

Answer: 0"

260,"Explanation: The claim that the gun industry is the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability is not accurate. While the gun industry does have certain protections, such as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which limits lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers, this is not true for all businesses in America. Many industries have some form of liability protection, and the gun industry is not uniquely protected in this regard.

Answer: 0"
261,"Explanation: The claim suggests that bank tellers were paid kickbacks for directing elderly consumers from safe deposits to risky ones. This is a serious allegation that, if true, would indicate fraudulent activity and a breach of trust. However, without specific evidence or sources to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its authenticity. Such claims are often made in the context of broader investigations or reports from regulatory bodies, and they should be backed by credible sources.

Answer: 0"
262,"Explanation: Barack Obama did not pass an immigration bill in his first year as President.

The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of her views.

Answer: 0"
264,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the size of a proposed mine hole to the size of an entire district. The size of a mine hole can vary greatly depending on the specific project and its scale, but it is unlikely to be larger than an entire district. A district typically encompasses a large area, often including multiple neighborhoods, towns, or cities. Therefore, the claim that the mine hole is bigger than the entire district is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the mine's size.

Answer: 0"
265,"Explanation: The claim that health insurance companies are making record profits right now is not accurate. While some health insurance companies have reported profits, the overall industry has been facing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased healthcare costs, and regulatory pressures. The claim is an oversimplification and does not reflect the complex financial landscape of the health insurance industry.

Answer: 0"
266,"Explanation: The claim is a misinterpretation of a quote from President Obama. The full quote is: ""If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."" The ""somebody else"" refers to the infrastructure, laws, and institutions that enable businesses to operate, not to the hard work of the business owners themselves. The quote is often used to criticize Obama's views on business success, but it is not accurate to say that he believes success is solely the result of government and not hard work.

Answer: 0"
267,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Fox News network, like any other news organization, is subject to the same legal and ethical standards as other media outlets. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it does not give any entity the right to deliberately distort news reports. Fox News, like other news organizations, is required to report facts accurately and responsibly. The claim that Fox News admits to lying and has the right to do so under the First Amendment is a misrepresentation of the facts and the law.

Answer: 0"
268,"Explanation: The claim is false. While Idaho did create a state-based marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, it was not the only Republican-led state to do so. Several other Republican-led states, such as Nevada, New Hampshire, and Alaska, also created their own marketplaces. Therefore, the claim that Idaho was the only Republican-led state to partner with President Obama in this way is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
269,"Explanation: The claim is false. The pay structure for law enforcement officers typically increases with experience and seniority, not with the duration of time spent on the force. A trooper with 10 years of experience would not be getting $500 more per year than a trooper with 10 minutes of experience. The pay scale is usually based on rank, experience, and other factors, not the exact duration of time spent on the force.

Answer: 0"
270,"Explanation: The claim that ""Only about a third of Texans who enroll in college graduate"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While it is true that graduation rates can vary widely, the claim does not provide specific data or context. According to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the six-year graduation rate for public universities in Texas is around 50%, and for community colleges, it is around 30%. However, these rates can vary significantly depending on the institution and the specific program of study. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate as it does not reflect the full range of graduation rates.

Answer: 0"
271,"Explanation: The Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) was established in 2008 to stabilize the financial system during the financial crisis. The total amount allocated to TARP was indeed $700 billion. However, the claim that $325 billion has been spent without purchasing any toxic assets is misleading. The $325 billion figure refers to the amount of money that was not used to purchase toxic assets, not the total amount spent. The program has been used to purchase assets, provide loans, and make investments to stabilize the financial system. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of isolated incidents.

Answer: 0"
277,"Explanation: The claim that the average cost for health insurance in Florida went from about $600 a month for an individual to about $150 a month is false. The average cost of health insurance in Florida has been fluctuating but has not dropped to $150 a month.

281,"Explanation: Members of the military typically contribute to their pension through a combination of their salary and a percentage of their pay. This is often referred to as the Blended Retirement System (BRS) in the United States, where service members contribute a portion of their pay to their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and receive a defined benefit pension upon retirement. Therefore, the claim that members of the military do not contribute toward their pension is false.

Answer: 0"
282,"Explanation: The claim that there are no earmarks in the stimulus bill is false. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which includes the stimulus bill, contains earmarks.

283,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that there were no major radical Islamic terrorist attacks in the United States between 2001 and 2009, there were several notable incidents during this period. For example, the Fort Hood shooting in 2009, where a soldier opened fire on his fellow soldiers, killing 13 and injuring 32. Additionally, the attempted Christmas Day bombing in 2009, where a Nigerian man attempted to detonate a bomb on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. These incidents demonstrate that the claim is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
286,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every engine manufacturer in the United States is now in the state of Texas"" is false.

While student loan debt is a significant issue, the average debt is much lower.

This is significantly lower than the hundreds of thousands of dollars suggested in the claim.

Answer: 0"
290,"Explanation: The claim that fully inflating tires can reduce oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent is not supported by expert consensus. While it is true that properly inflated tires can improve fuel efficiency, the exact percentage of reduction in oil consumption is not universally agreed upon and varies based on factors such as vehicle type, driving conditions, and tire quality. Therefore, the claim that ""every expert says"" this reduction is 3 to 4 percent is an overstatement.

Answer: 0"
291,"Explanation: The claim is false. The $1.8 billion deficit does not directly translate to a $300 cost per individual or $1,200 for families of four. The cost of a deficit is typically spread across the entire population and is not a direct per-person charge. The claim seems to be an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the financial impact of the deficit.

Answer: 0"
292,"Explanation: The claim states that new figures released by the speaker for Wisconsin job gains in 2011 are the final job numbers. However, without specific context or verification from a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm whether these figures are indeed the final job numbers for 2011. Job numbers are typically updated periodically, and there could be subsequent revisions or updates. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
293,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, in 2020, there were 93,331 drug overdose deaths in the United States, which is indeed a significant number. However, the claim that ""about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day"" is not accurate. To find the average daily deaths, you would divide the total number of deaths by the number of days in a year. In 2020, there were 365 days, so the calculation would be 93,331 / 365 ≈ 256.2 deaths per day, not 120. Additionally, the claim that ""drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms"" is also not accurate. According to the CDC, in 2020, there were 19,580 deaths from firearms, which is less than the 93,331 deaths from drug overdoses.

Answer: 0"
295,"Explanation: The claim that the health care plan for members of Congress is ""no better than the janitor who cleans their offices"" is a false statement. Members of Congress, like all federal employees, are eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a comprehensive health insurance plan. This plan is considered one of the best in the country and is not comparable to the health insurance plans available to janitors or other non-federal employees. The claim is a misrepresentation of the actual benefits and quality of the health care plan available to members of Congress.

Answer: 0"
296,"Explanation: The claim is false. While Virginia has a rich history and was one of the first colonies in the United States, it is not accurate to say that it was first in ""most things except witch trials.""

Witch trials were more prevalent in other colonies like Salem, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.

297,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law in 2010, but it did not immediately affect small businesses or individuals in the way described.

Answer: 0"
298,"Explanation: The claim that ""a majority of our students are trapped in underperforming schools"" is a broad statement that requires specific data and context to evaluate accurately.

Answer: 0"
300,"Explanation: The claim that every family health insurance policy has a ""$900 hidden tax"" to subsidize health care costs of the uninsured is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not impose a $900 tax on all health insurance policies. Instead, it includes a tax on high-cost health plans, known as the ""Cadillac tax,"" which is not a hidden tax and only applies to certain high-cost plans. Additionally, the ACA does not use a flat tax of $900 to subsidize the uninsured; instead, it uses a combination of subsidies and other mechanisms to help reduce the cost of health insurance for low- and middle-income individuals.

Answer: 0"
301,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds during her campaign for president is false.

According to Federal Election Commission records, Clinton's campaign received approximately $600 million in total contributions during her 2016 presidential campaign.

Answer: 0"
302,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama flip-flopped on withdrawing troops from Iraq is false. President Obama's policy on Iraq was consistent throughout his presidency.

Answer: 0"
303,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law by President George W.

This law is part of the Medicare program and is not subject to negotiation by the government.

According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's historical tables, non-defense discretionary spending has increased by approximately 10 percent from 2019 to 2021. This increase is significantly lower than the 80 percent claimed.

Answer: 0"
306,"Explanation: The claim that two million new jobs have been created in California since 2011 is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total number of nonfarm jobs in California in 2011 was approximately 11.5 million. By 2021, the number had increased to about 13.5 million. This means that the total number of jobs created in California from 2011 to 2021 is around 2 million, but this is not a new creation since 2011 but rather a cumulative increase over the decade.

Answer: 0"
307,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific action (replacing 100,000 old toilets) and a resulting water savings (2.4 million gallons per day). However, the claim does not provide any context or source for the information, making it difficult to verify its accuracy. Without additional information or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this claim.

308,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia Republicans have mismanaged unemployment benefits is a broad statement that requires specific evidence to support. Without specific details or sources, it is difficult to definitively judge the claim as true or false. However, if the claim is based on general mismanagement or specific incidents, further investigation would be needed to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific evidence.)"
309,"Explanation: The claim that the fertilizer plant in West, Texas, had not been inspected by the state of Texas since 2006 is false. The plant was inspected by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) in 2013, just before the explosion. The TCEQ had previously inspected the plant in 2006, but the claim that no inspections had been conducted since then is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
310,"Explanation: The claim that federal regulations required changes to Georgia's driver's license renewal process is false. Federal regulations do not typically dictate the specifics of state driver's license renewal processes. Each state has its own regulations and processes for driver's license renewals, which are usually governed by state laws and not federal regulations.

Answer: 0"
311,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton invented ISIS or is responsible for ISIS is false. ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), emerged in 2014 as a result of complex political, social, and religious factors in the Middle East. The group's origins can be traced back to the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which led to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the rise of various extremist groups. Hillary Clinton, as a former Secretary of State, was involved in U.S. foreign policy during this period, but there is no credible evidence to suggest that she played a direct role in the creation or growth of ISIS. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked by fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
312,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fifty-three percent of teens in Central Falls are getting pregnant"" is likely false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the teen pregnancy rate in the United States is around 18.8 per 1,000 females aged 15-19. This rate is significantly lower than 53%. Additionally, there is no specific data available that supports a 53% pregnancy rate for teens in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

313,"Explanation: Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, has not publicly called the Arizona law a model for the nation. In fact, Romney has been critical of the Arizona law, which is often referred to as SB 1070, due to its controversial provisions related to immigration enforcement. He has expressed concerns about the law's potential to lead to racial profiling and other issues.

Answer: 0"
315,"Explanation: The claim that Snitker has been virtually ignored by the major media is subjective and depends on the definition of ""major media"" and ""ignored."" If ""major media"" refers to mainstream news outlets and ""ignored"" means receiving little to no coverage, this claim would be difficult to verify without specific examples or data. However, if ""major media"" is interpreted broadly to include various types of media coverage and ""ignored"" is interpreted as receiving minimal attention, the claim could be true or false depending on the context.

Answer: 0/1"
316,"Explanation: Miami Dade College (MDC) is a large institution with a diverse student body. According to the college's official website and various reports, MDC serves students from over 170 countries, speaking more than 100 languages. The claim that there are 86 languages spoken at Miami Dade College is an underestimation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
317,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. Capitol was built by slaves is false. While it is true that slaves were involved in the construction of the Capitol, they were not the primary workforce. The majority of the labor was done by free workers, including immigrants and skilled craftsmen. The misconception likely arises from the fact that slaves were used for some of the more menial tasks, but they did not build the Capitol.

Answer: 0"
318,"Explanation: Prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases refers to the authority of immigration officials to decide whether to initiate or pursue legal action against an individual. This discretion is used to prioritize cases based on factors such as the severity of the offense, the individual's criminal history, and the public interest. The claim is true as it accurately describes a legal concept in immigration law.

Answer: 1"
319,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate was at its lowest point during Barack Obama's presidency, reaching 3.6% in 2019. This was the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s and was significantly lower than the rates during Jimmy Carter's presidency. Therefore, the number of adults working was higher during Obama's presidency compared to Carter's.

Answer: 0"
320,"Explanation: The claim is made by a political figure, and it is a common practice for political campaigns to highlight the number of small donations they receive.

Answer: 0/1"
321,"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown failed to pay his own taxes three separate times is false. There is no credible evidence or sources supporting this claim.

Answer: 0"
322,"Explanation: The claim that Miami-Dade has the nation's highest-rated tap water is not accurate. While Miami-Dade County does have high-quality tap water, it is not the highest-rated in the nation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other organizations regularly publish reports on water quality, and Miami-Dade's water quality is generally considered good, but it does not consistently rank as the highest in the nation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
323,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is the only president to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare is false. While it is true that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, included provisions that reduced Medicare spending, the total reduction was not $500 billion. The ACA reduced Medicare spending by about $716 billion over 10 years, but this was achieved through a combination of cuts to Medicare providers and other measures, not a single $500 billion cut. Additionally, other presidents have also implemented policies that reduced Medicare spending, such as the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 under President Bill Clinton.

Answer: 0"
324,"Explanation: The United States is often considered one of the oldest democracies in the world, but it is not the oldest. The title of the oldest democracy is typically given to the United Kingdom, which has a history of democratic institutions dating back to the Magna Carta in 1215. The United States, while having a long history of democratic principles, was founded in 1776, which is later than the UK's democratic roots.

Answer: 0"
325,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Senate version of the health reform bill, also known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), does not include a provision that requires every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) enrolled plan to pay a minimum of $1 per month towards reproductive rights, including abortion. The AHCA does not mandate such a payment and does not expand coverage for reproductive health services in this manner.

Answer: 0"
326,"Explanation: The claim that the average person will pay $6,000 more a year under Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal is based on a specific analysis of the proposal. The $6,000 figure is derived from a study conducted by the Urban Institute, which estimated that the average person would pay $6,000 more in out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan Medicare plan. This study was widely cited in news reports and political discussions.

Answer: 1"
327,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that there are some missing service members from previous and current conflicts, the number is not in the tens of thousands. The Department of Defense's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has been working to find and repatriate missing service members, but the number of missing service members is significantly lower than the claim suggests. As of 2021, the DPAA has accounted for 81% of the 83,000 service members listed as missing from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War. The remaining 19% are still missing, which is approximately 15,600 service members.

328,"Explanation: The claim that Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in the town square and that he is a distant cousin of the speaker is not verifiable. While it is true that Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in Abilene, Kansas, there is no historical evidence to support the claim that he is a distant cousin of the speaker. Family legends can be interesting, but they are not always accurate or verifiable.

Answer: 0"
329,"Explanation: The claim that Mike Morell testified to Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS oil fields is due to concerns about global warming is false. Mike Morell, a former CIA deputy director, did testify before Congress in 2015, but he did not make this specific claim. The testimony focused on the broader strategy against ISIS and the challenges of the conflict, but there was no mention of global warming as a reason for not bombing ISIS oil fields.

Answer: 0"
330,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 data, Ohio ranks 10th in the nation for total exports of goods and services. This means that Ohio exports more than 41 other states, but not more than the top 9 states. Therefore, the claim is true.

332,"Explanation: Barack Obama did not openly support Raila Odinga during his visit to Africa in 2006.

The claim is a misrepresentation of the events.

Answer: 0"
333,"Explanation: The claim that Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit is false.

Without additional context or details, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
336,"Explanation: The claim that gun ownership information could be recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not include provisions for the collection of gun ownership information. The ACA primarily focuses on expanding access to health insurance and improving the quality of healthcare services. There are no provisions in the ACA that authorize the collection of gun ownership data by the federal government or insurance companies.

Answer: 0"
337,"Explanation: Exit polls are surveys conducted at polling stations to gather information about voters' choices and opinions. While exit polls can provide valuable insights into voting patterns, they are not always accurate and can be influenced by various factors such as sampling bias, non-response bias, and the wording of questions. Therefore, it is not uncommon for exit poll results to vary significantly from actual election outcomes. Additionally, the claim that Democrats receive over 70 percent of LGBT votes in federal elections is a generalization that may not hold true for all elections or regions. Specific exit poll data would be needed to verify this claim.

Answer: 0"
338,"Explanation: The claim that Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country and includes an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons is not accurate. While Connecticut does have strict gun control laws, including an assault weapons ban, it is not accurate to say it has the fifth toughest laws in the country. Additionally, the specific number of weapons banned under the assault weapons ban is not 35.

Answer: 0"
339,"Explanation: The claim that the Romney/Ryan budget would allow interest rates on federal student loans to double is false. The Romney/Ryan budget proposal in 2012 did not include a provision to double the interest rates on federal student loans. Instead, it proposed to cap the interest rates at 8.5% for undergraduate loans and 10.5% for graduate loans, which were lower than the rates at the time. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the budget proposal.

Answer: 0"
340,"Explanation: The claim that the state had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, state spending in the U.S. has been increasing over the past few years, with a total of $1.1 trillion in 2019 and $1.2 trillion in 2020. There is no evidence to support the claim that $13 billion was cut from state spending over two years.

Answer: 0"
341,"Explanation: The claim that 17 million American children had a pre-existing condition and were uninsurable when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed is false. The ACA was signed into law in 2010, and it included provisions to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions. The claim likely confuses the number of uninsured individuals with the number of people who had pre-existing conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of uninsured children in the U.S. was around 10% in 2010, which translates to approximately 7.5 million children. However, the ACA did not directly address the issue of pre-existing conditions for children specifically, as it primarily focused on adults.

Answer: 0"
342,"Explanation: The claim that local Texas chambers of commerce were granted exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarters is false. In Texas, chambers of commerce are typically required to pay property taxes on their properties, just like any other business or organization. There is no specific exemption granted to chambers of commerce for property tax purposes.

Answer: 0"
343,"Explanation: Preventive care, such as regular check-ups, screenings, and immunizations, can indeed save money in the long run. By catching health issues early, preventive care can prevent more costly treatments and hospitalizations. This is true for individuals, families, businesses (through health insurance and employee wellness programs), and governments (through reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity). Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
344,"Explanation: The claim suggests that in Florida, it is not illegal for an immediate family member of state officials to benefit from legislation supported by a spouse. This claim is false because Florida, like many other states, has laws against conflicts of interest and improper influence. These laws prohibit public officials from using their position to benefit themselves or their family members. For example, Florida Statutes § 112.314 prohibits public officials from using their official position to secure a special privilege for themselves or others. Therefore, the claim that it is not illegal for an immediate family member to prosper from legislation supported by a spouse is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
345,"Explanation: The claim that scientists are in dispute over whether being gay is a choice is false. The overwhelming consensus among scientists and medical professionals is that sexual orientation is not a choice. The American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, and other major health organizations have stated that sexual orientation is not a choice and is not a mental disorder. The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973.

Answer: 0"
346,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statistic about substance abuse treatment in Rhode Island. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as government health reports, official statistics from the Rhode Island Department of Health, or reputable news outlets that have reported on this specific data. Without access to these sources, I cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
347,"Explanation: The claim that the Koch brothers want to protect tax cuts for companies that ship jobs overseas is a simplification and misrepresentation of their actual stance. The Koch brothers, through their political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, have indeed advocated for lower corporate taxes and less regulation, but their primary focus is on reducing the overall tax burden on businesses, not specifically on companies that ship jobs overseas. They have also been criticized for their role in promoting policies that can lead to job outsourcing, but it's not accurate to say they are solely focused on protecting tax cuts for such companies.

Answer: 0"
348,"Explanation: The claim that raising income tax rates will likely reduce federal revenues is a complex economic issue that depends on various factors. While it is true that higher tax rates can discourage work and investment, leading to lower tax revenues, this is not always the case. The Laffer Curve, a theoretical representation of the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue, suggests that there is an optimal tax rate that maximizes revenue. However, the actual impact of tax rate changes on federal revenues can vary based on economic conditions, the specific tax rates being considered, and other factors such as tax avoidance strategies and economic growth.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
349,"Explanation: The claim that there are 3 million jobs that go vacant each month in this country is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly job openings in the United States is around 6.7 million, not 3 million. This figure is based on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data.

Answer: 0"
350,"Explanation: The claim that Kasich's budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder, is a simplification and exaggeration of the actual tax changes implemented during his tenure as governor of Ohio. While there were some tax increases, they were not as significant as the claim suggests. The tax increases were primarily targeted at businesses, but the impact on the middle class was not as severe as the claim implies. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
351,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney used to favor gun control and said he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush is partially true. Romney did support certain gun control measures during his 2012 presidential campaign, such as background checks and a ban on assault weapons. However, he also supported the Second Amendment and has since shifted his stance on gun control. The claim that he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush is a simplification of his political views and does not accurately reflect his current stance.

Answer: 0"
352,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""you don't mention it's also the biggest tax cut in history"" is a misinterpretation of the context. The Morning Joe show on MSNBC often discusses various political and economic topics, including tax policies. The claim that the biggest tax increase in history is also the biggest tax cut in history is a contradiction because a tax increase and a tax cut are opposite actions. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
353,"Explanation: The claim that Sarah Palin had ""executive experience"" in the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) is false. While Sarah Palin was involved in the PTA as a member and later served as the president of the Wasilla High School PTA, her role was not an executive position in the broader sense. She did not hold an executive position in the PTA at the national or state level, nor did she have executive experience in the context of a corporate or political executive role.

Answer: 0"
354,"Explanation: The claim about President Barack Obama's activities over the last six months is not verifiable and appears to be a fabrication. There is no credible source or evidence to support the claim that he has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers, while his jobs council has never met. This information is not consistent with known facts about his activities and is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
355,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the newly created Immigration Enforcement Review Board can prosecute and jail violators with the help of the attorney general. However, the role of the Immigration Enforcement Review Board and the attorney general's involvement in immigration enforcement are not typically aligned in this manner. The board is usually responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on immigration cases, while the attorney general's role is more focused on legal policy and guidance. Prosecution and jail time for immigration violations are typically handled by immigration enforcement agencies like ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and the Department of Homeland Security, not the review board or the attorney general.

Answer: 0"
356,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific dataset from the U.S. Congress, where men hold 80% of the seats in the 117th Congress (2021-2023). This data is accurate and can be verified through official sources such as the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The claim is specific to the 117th Congress and does not generalize to all legislatures or time periods.

Answer: 1"
357,"Explanation: The claim that the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding is false. Automobiles contribute to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental issues, but their elimination would not be offset by a single volcanic eruption. Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of ash, gases, and heat, which can have significant environmental impacts, but they do not directly offset the specific environmental issues caused by automobiles.

Answer: 0"
358,"Explanation: The claim that Virginia public schools have cut 5,000 positions since 2008 is false. According to the Virginia Department of Education, the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions in Virginia public schools has actually increased over the past decade. In 2008, there were approximately 100,000 FTE positions, and by 2020, this number had increased to around 110,000 FTE positions. Therefore, the claim that 5,000 positions have been cut is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
359,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific budget proposal by a president, which is a political statement and not a verified fact. The actual impact of the budget on the deficit would depend on various factors, including the implementation of the proposed policies and the economic conditions over the next decade. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim without further context or official data.

Answer: 0"
360,"Explanation: The claim that the 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks has been debunked is false. According to various polls and surveys, a significant majority of Americans consistently support background checks for gun purchases. For instance, a 2019 Gallup poll found that 96% of Americans support background checks for all gun purchases. This statistic has been widely reported and is not debunked.

Answer: 0"
361,"Explanation: Bob Barr, a former Republican congressman, has indeed changed his position on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) over the years. Initially, he supported DOMA, but later he became a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and opposed DOMA. He even ran for president in 2008 as a candidate for the Libertarian Party and supported same-sex marriage.

Answer: 1"
362,"Explanation: The claim ""Youth unemployment is through the roof"" is subjective and can vary depending on the specific context and time period. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to look at specific data from reliable sources such as the World Bank, the International Labour Organization, or national statistical agencies. Without specific data, it is difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific data.)"
363,"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown is an ""Obama rubber stamp"" for supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan is a political statement that can be interpreted differently based on one's perspective. Sherrod Brown, a Democratic Senator from Ohio, has indeed supported various environmental policies, including cap and trade, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, labeling him as a ""rubber stamp"" for Obama and suggesting that these policies are ""job-killing"" is a simplification and a political attack. The effectiveness of cap and trade on job creation is a subject of debate among economists and policymakers, with some arguing that it can create jobs in renewable energy sectors while others argue it can lead to job losses in certain industries.

Answer: 0"
364,"Explanation: The claim that driving on average in America this summer will save you about $70 according to Department of Energy figures is misleading. The Department of Energy's Energy Saver 101 guide does not provide specific figures for summer driving savings. The claim likely refers to general fuel efficiency improvements or cost savings due to driving habits, but it is not accurate to attribute a specific $70 savings to summer driving based on Department of Energy figures.

Answer: 0"
365,"Explanation: The claim is about the number of investigations conducted by a certain entity into housing discrimination and the amount of damages awarded. However, the claim does not specify which entity is conducting these investigations or provide any sources to verify the information.

Answer: 0"
367,"Explanation: The claim that 46 percent of women between the age of 16 to 24 despise sexual contact in Japan is not supported by any credible sources or studies. There is no widely accepted data or research that indicates such a high percentage of young women in Japan feeling this way. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of data on sexual attitudes or preferences.

Answer: 0"
368,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no evidence to suggest that the President of the United States has expressed a desire for the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.'s International Criminal Court (ICC). The U.S. has consistently maintained a position of non-ratification of the ICC, citing concerns about the court's jurisdiction and the potential for political bias.

Answer: 0"
369,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been paying out more in benefits than it takes in since 2010, not just this week. The SSA's annual reports and financial statements confirm this trend. The claim that this was supposed to happen in 2016 is also incorrect, as the SSA has been in this situation since 2010.

Answer: 0"
370,"Explanation: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has indeed expressed concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the Systematic Alienization Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database for verifying citizenship on voter rolls. The SAVE database is used to check the citizenship status of individuals applying for certain government benefits, but it has been criticized for its potential inaccuracies and the risk of including U.S. citizens in its lists of non-citizens. The DHS has acknowledged these limitations and has not claimed that the SAVE database is a foolproof means of verification.

Answer: 1"
371,"Explanation: The United States has been actively modernizing its nuclear weapons. The U.S. Department of Defense has been working on the W76-2 warhead, which is a modernized version of the W76-1 warhead. Additionally, the U.S. is developing the W80-1 warhead for the B61-12 gravity bomb. These efforts are part of the U.S. nuclear modernization program, which aims to replace and upgrade aging nuclear weapons systems.

Answer: 0"
372,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""he did mandate health care for Massachusetts, which is HillaryCare"" is misleading. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, was a federal law that expanded health insurance coverage for Americans. The claim that this is ""HillaryCare"" is a political term used to criticize the ACA, but it is not accurate to say that the ACA was a mandate for Massachusetts alone. Additionally, the claim that he doesn't want to do for America what he did for Massachusetts is a false equivalence, as the ACA was a federal law, not a state-specific mandate.

Answer: 0"
373,"Explanation: The claim ""Soy ... el nico official estatal quin es un hombre de negocios"" is incomplete and grammatically incorrect. It appears to be a fragment of a sentence that is not clear or coherent. Without additional context or a complete sentence, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

374,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry said there is an administrator for every teacher in Texas public schools is false. Rick Perry, who served as the Governor of Texas from 2009 to 2015, did not make such a statement. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his policies or statements regarding education in Texas.

Answer: 0"
375,"Explanation: The claim states that it has been 14 years since a president, vice president, or a member of their family has attended an Olympic event. This claim is false because there have been instances of presidents and vice presidents attending Olympic events within the past 14 years. For example, President Barack Obama attended the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and Vice President Joe Biden attended the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
376,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not released any analysis that states the current healthcare plan would create a $6 billion surplus over 10 years. The CBO's most recent analysis of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which includes provisions related to healthcare, did not indicate a surplus. Instead, the CBO estimated that the plan would increase the federal deficit by $1.9 trillion over 10 years.

Answer: 0"
377,"Explanation: The claim that the health care reform bill is the largest tax increase in U.S. history is false. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) did introduce new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes were not the largest tax increase in U.S. history. The largest tax increase in U.S. history was the Revenue Act of 1942, which was implemented during World War II and significantly increased taxes to fund the war effort.

Answer: 0"
378,"Explanation: The claim that ""more than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid"" is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid spending as a percentage of state tax revenues varies significantly by state.

381,"Explanation: The claim is comparing civilian casualties in Cambodia with those from American drone attacks. However, the comparison is not directly relevant because the two events are not comparable in nature. The Cambodian conflict involved a complex mix of political, military, and humanitarian factors, while American drone attacks are a specific military tactic used in various conflicts. Without specific data on the number of civilian casualties in Cambodia and the number of civilian casualties from American drone attacks, it is impossible to accurately compare the two. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

However, the claim does not provide accurate data or context to support the statement.

Answer: 0"
386,"Explanation: The claim that ""Our kids cant openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school"" is generally false. In many countries, including the United States, students are allowed to celebrate Christmas and pray in school, as long as it is done in a way that respects the rights and beliefs of all students.

Answer: 0"
387,"Explanation: The claim states that the opponent has ""zero times a judge, zero rulings, zero experience on the bench."" This implies that the opponent has no experience as a judge, has not made any rulings, and has never served on the bench. Without specific information about the opponent's background, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Crist has generally supported the Second Amendment, he has also expressed some nuanced views on gun control and has supported certain measures to address gun violence.

Answer: 1"
395,"Explanation: The claim that health care reform will not affect veterans' benefits is generally true. Veterans' benefits are typically managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are not directly tied to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or other health care reforms. While there may be some indirect effects, such as changes in the VA's budget or the way it provides care, the core benefits like disability compensation, health care, and burial services are not directly impacted by health care reform.

397,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of government spending: interest payments and national security. Interest payments are the cost of borrowing money, while national security spending includes defense, intelligence, and other related expenses. These two categories are fundamentally different and cannot be directly compared in terms of their impact on the economy or the government's budget. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 1"
403,"Explanation: Social Security and Medicare are not a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading. In contrast, Social Security and Medicare are government-run programs funded through payroll taxes and general revenues, with benefits paid to eligible individuals based on their contributions and the program's rules. The funds are managed by the government and are not used to pay off earlier investors.

Answer: 0"
404,"Explanation: The claim that ""the majority actually want single-payer health care"" is not universally true. Opinions on healthcare systems, including single-payer systems, vary widely among different populations and regions. While some polls and surveys suggest that a significant portion of people in certain countries or regions support single-payer healthcare, it is not accurate to say that the majority of people worldwide or in any specific country universally want it. Opinions are influenced by various factors such as political leanings, personal experiences, and cultural attitudes towards healthcare.

Answer: 0"
405,"Explanation: The claim is about the financial reserves of Tennessee's lottery scholarship program.

The specific details of the tax credit and policy cost mentioned in the claim are not accurate.

Answer: 0"
409,"Explanation: The claim that Fox viewers are the most consistently misinformed media viewers is a generalization and lacks specific evidence or data to support it. While some studies have shown that viewers of certain news outlets may have different levels of political bias or misinformation, there is no consistent polling data that universally supports the claim that Fox viewers are the most misinformed. The claim is also subjective and could be influenced by political bias.

Answer: 0"
414,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has indeed had a significant impact on reducing the number of uninsured individuals in Oregon. According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsured rate in Oregon decreased from 14.6% in 2013 to 7.5% in 2019.

Answer: 0"
417,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require 100% of Americans to depend on federal payments or government benefits. The ACA aims to provide access to affordable health insurance for all Americans, but it does not eliminate private insurance or require everyone to rely on government benefits. Some people may still choose to purchase private insurance, and others may qualify for government assistance to help with their premiums or out-of-pocket costs. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresents the purpose and effects of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
418,"Explanation: The claim that the sequester has already lost 1.6 million jobs is false. The sequester, which is a series of automatic spending cuts implemented in 2013, has been shown to have had a minimal impact on job growth. Studies by the Congressional Budget Office and other economic analysts have indicated that the sequester had a negligible effect on employment. The claim of 1.6 million jobs lost is not supported by credible economic data.

In the United States, projects like this typically require approval from multiple federal agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and others. The review process can indeed take several months or even years, depending on the complexity of the project and the number of agencies involved.

Answer: 1"
422,"Explanation: The claim that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad is not irrefutable in the context of social science. While some studies suggest that children raised by two parents may have certain advantages, such as better academic performance or emotional well-being, these findings are not universally applicable and are often influenced by various factors such as socioeconomic status, family dynamics, and individual differences. Moreover, the notion that children need both parents to thrive is not supported by all research, as many children raised by single parents or in other family structures also thrive and achieve success. Therefore, the claim is not irrefutable.

Answer: 0"
423,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a quote often attributed to George Washington, but there is no evidence that he actually said these exact words. The quote is more commonly attributed to Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in a letter to William S. Smith in 1787: ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason for the people to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, for self-preservation against tyranny in government."" While the sentiment expressed in the claim is similar to Jefferson's words, it is not a direct quote from Washington.

Answer: 0"
424,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no verified information indicating that Governor Chris Christie has embarked on a tour to demand that New Jersey's Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest.

This effort ultimately led to a recall election, where Walker was re-elected.

Answer: 1"
427,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific study or data point that is not widely cited or verified. The 2008 recession had a significant impact on various sectors, and the recovery has been uneven. However, the claim that 60% of the jobs lost were living-wage jobs and only 40% of the jobs gained are living-wage jobs is not supported by widely accepted data or studies. The claim seems to be a generalization without specific sources or evidence.

Answer: 0"
428,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010 and has significantly altered the healthcare landscape in the United States. It introduced several changes, including the expansion of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance marketplaces, and the requirement for most Americans to have health insurance. While the ACA has had a complex impact on the healthcare system, it has not fundamentally altered the doctor-patient relationship. The core of the relationship remains centered on the patient and their healthcare provider. The ACA has introduced new regulations and requirements, but it has not fundamentally changed the nature of the relationship between doctors and their patients.

Answer: 0"
429,"Explanation: Austin is indeed known for its thriving startup scene, with a significant number of venture capital investments and patent filings. According to various reports and rankings, Austin is often considered one of the top cities in Texas for startups and venture capital. However, it's important to note that the claim does not specify a particular metric or time frame, so it's difficult to definitively say that Austin is ""number one"" in Texas across all categories (startups, venture capital, and patents) at any given moment. Therefore, while the claim is largely true, it's not entirely accurate to say that Austin is ""number one"" in Texas in all these categories simultaneously.

Answer: 0.5 (The claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate.)"
430,"Explanation: The claim that stimulus money went to studying ants in Africa is false. Stimulus money is typically allocated to projects that have a direct impact on the economy, such as infrastructure, job creation, and small business support.

Additionally, the total number of people laid off in Wisconsin in 2015 was 6,685, which is indeed more than the 5,985 in 2014. However, the claim that Wisconsin's economy has ""tanked"" under Gov. Scott Walker is not supported by the data, as the unemployment rate and the number of layoffs were both lower in 2015 compared to 2014.

Answer: 0"
435,"Explanation: The claim is false. The BlackBerry was not created by John McCain. The BlackBerry was developed by Research in Motion (RIM), a Canadian company, and was first released in 1999.

436,"Explanation: The claim that ""a lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government"" is false. The federal government does offer income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs, but these are not the same as refinancing. Refinancing typically involves a private lender taking over the loan, which is not a service provided by the federal government. The federal government does not refinance student loans in the traditional sense.

Answer: 0"
437,"Explanation: The claim that ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected, specifically $1.8 trillion, is false. The initial cost estimate for the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) was around $900 billion over 10 years, not $1.8 trillion. The $1.8 trillion figure is often cited in the context of the total cost of the healthcare system in the United States, not just the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
438,"Explanation: The claim is false. While there are laws in various states that require independent investigations into deaths in police custody, there is no single governor who has signed such a law for the entire United States.

Answer: 0"
439,"Explanation: The claim that Ron Johnson opposes entirely a federal minimum wage, except perhaps for guest workers, is a simplification and misrepresentation of his actual stance. Ron Johnson, a Republican Senator from Wisconsin, has expressed opposition to a federal minimum wage increase, arguing that it should be left to the states to decide. However, he has not explicitly stated that he opposes a federal minimum wage entirely, nor has he indicated that he supports it only for guest workers. The claim is false as it distorts his position.

Answer: 0"
440,"Explanation: The claim is a political statement that suggests increasing domestic production of fuel to ensure affordability for Americans.

Answer: 0"
441,"Explanation: The claim ""For the past year, I was censored and muzzled"" is subjective and cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence. Censorship and muzzling are often used to describe situations where someone's speech or expression is restricted or suppressed, but these terms are not typically used in a general or universal context. Without specific details or evidence, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
442,"Explanation: The claim is false. The $6,000 figure is not based on any official or reliable source. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which provided tax cuts for the wealthy, did not result in a $6,000 annual cost for middle-class families. The actual impact of the tax cuts on middle-class families varies and is not as straightforward as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
443,"Explanation: The claim that the Texas leg of the Keystone pipeline has created 4,800 jobs in just the year it has been up and running is not accurate. The Keystone XL pipeline, which includes the Texas leg, was completed in November 2022, and it is not accurate to attribute 4,800 jobs to just the year it has been operational. The pipeline's construction phase created many jobs, but the operational phase does not typically create as many jobs. Additionally, the claim does not specify the source of the information, which is a red flag for credibility.

Answer: 0"
444,"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was a strong advocate for border security and supported the construction of a border fence.

Therefore, the claim that McCain opposed the border fence is false.

Answer: 0"
445,"Explanation: The claim that NATO has changed its policy to focus on terrorism threats is not accurate. NATO has indeed been involved in counter-terrorism efforts, but it has not created a new division specifically focused on terrorism threats. NATO's primary mission remains collective defense against external threats, and its counter-terrorism efforts are part of its broader mission. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of NATO's activities.

447,"Explanation: The claim that 68 percent of kids born in the African-American community today are born out of wedlock is not accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the percentage of births to unmarried mothers in the African-American community has been fluctuating but is not consistently at 68%. The most recent data from the CDC shows that the percentage of births to unmarried mothers in the African-American community is around 70%, but this figure is not static and varies over time. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 1"
451,"Explanation: The claim that more children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry is not accurate. While agricultural work can be dangerous and children are often involved in these activities, especially in developing countries, the number of child deaths in agriculture is not higher than in other industries. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), child labor in agriculture is prevalent, but the number of child deaths in agriculture is not disproportionately higher compared to other sectors. The claim is misleading and not supported by reliable data.

Answer: 0"
452,"Explanation: The claim that rabid animals from other states carry different strains of rabies that Florida vaccines and serums don't affect is false. Rabies is caused by a virus that affects the nervous system and is transmitted through the bite of an infected animal. The virus does not mutate into different strains that are resistant to vaccines and serums. The rabies vaccine and serums used in Florida are effective against the rabies virus regardless of the state of origin of the infected animal. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirm that the rabies vaccine is effective against all strains of the virus.

Answer: 0"

455,"Explanation: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is the largest tax increase in the history of the United States is not accurate. While the ACA did introduce several new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes are not the largest in U.S. history. For example, the Revenue Act of 1913, which established the modern income tax system, and the Revenue Act of 1940, which introduced the payroll tax, were larger tax increases. Therefore, the claim is false.

Therefore, it's not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
465,"Explanation: The claim that an annual income of $500,000 in Manhattan is considered middle class is false. In Manhattan, the median household income is around $100,000, and the average household income is around $150,000. Therefore, an income of $500,000 would be considered high income or upper class, not middle class.

Answer: 0/1"
467,"Explanation: The claim that then-Sen. Barack Obama refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership is false. In reality, Sen. Obama voted to raise the debt ceiling multiple times during his time in the Senate, including in 2004 and 2005. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation of Sen. Obama's stance on the debt ceiling and his criticism of President Bush's economic policies.

Answer: 0"
468,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) did not find that the stimulus bill would lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2019. The CBO's analysis of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus bill) estimated that the legislation would increase GDP by 1.4 percent in 2009 and 2.6 percent in 2010, not reduce it.

Answer: 1"
475,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Hosni Mubarak were all authoritarian leaders who suppressed independent unions, the claim that they ""didn't want unions"" is an oversimplification. Hitler, for instance, initially supported the German Labor Front (DAF) as a means to control the German workforce, but later suppressed it. Stalin also initially supported unions but later suppressed them as part of his broader campaign to control all aspects of society. Mubarak, similarly, initially allowed some unions but later suppressed them as part of his authoritarian rule. Therefore, the claim that they ""didn't want unions"" is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
476,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not establish a new board of federal bureaucrats to dictate health plans. The ACA does create a Health Insurance Marketplace and provides subsidies for individuals to purchase health insurance, but it does not give a federal board the authority to dictate specific health plans for all individuals. The claim is a misrepresentation of the ACA's provisions.

Answer: 0"
477,"Explanation: The claim that the problem with invasive species in the Great Lakes is not ballast water is false. Ballast water is indeed a significant source of invasive species in the Great Lakes. Invasive species, such as zebra and quagga mussels, have been introduced through ballast water from ships, leading to significant ecological and economic impacts. Therefore, the claim that ballast water is not a problem is incorrect.

478,"Explanation: Dan Branch is a former Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas. He has not been known to have lobbied for the AFL-CIO, which is a federation of labor unions in the United States.

479,"Explanation: The claim is false. Kansas has elected Democrats to the U.S. Senate in recent history. For example, Pat Roberts, a Republican, was elected in 1996 and served until 2015. However, the claim suggests that no Democrat has been elected since before ""The Wizard of Oz"" hit the movie theaters in 1939, which is not accurate. The last Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from Kansas was Jerry Moran, who was elected in 2010.

Answer: 0"
480,"Explanation: The claim is false. Justice Sonia Sotomayor did not throw out the New Haven firefighters' lawsuit in an unsigned opinion. The case, Ricci v. DeStefano, was decided by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote, with Sotomayor dissenting. The majority opinion was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Sotomayor's dissent was signed and publicly available. The claim that the opinion was unsigned and that it was a ""sneaky"" move is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
481,"Explanation: The claim states that for the first time in 35 years, more businesses are dying than starting. This claim is based on a specific time frame and a specific comparison between business deaths and births.

Without specific data to support this claim, it is difficult to determine its veracity.

Answer: 0"
482,"Explanation: Systems development charges (SDCs) are fees levied by local governments to fund the costs of new infrastructure and services required to support new development. While it is true that SDCs are primarily intended for capital investments, such as roads, water and sewer lines, and other public infrastructure, the specific use of these funds can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the local government's policies. Some jurisdictions may allow for a portion of SDCs to be used for operational expenses or other purposes, but this is typically subject to specific regulations and oversight.

Answer: 0"
483,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney and Bain Capital are to blame for a woman's premature death due to the closure of the plant where her husband worked is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that Bain Capital, under Romney's leadership, closed several plants, including the one where the woman's husband worked, it is not accurate to attribute the woman's death directly to this closure. The claim lacks specific evidence linking the plant closure to the woman's death and does not consider other potential contributing factors to her health condition. Therefore, the claim is not supported by sufficient evidence.

Answer: 0"
484,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Texas Railroad Commission is a regulatory agency that oversees the oil and gas industry in Texas.

Answer: 1"
485,"Explanation: The 2013 immigration bill, also known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did not specifically address Syrian refugees or their resettlement. The bill focused on border security, legalization of undocumented immigrants, and other immigration-related issues. The resettlement of Syrian refugees was a separate issue that began to gain attention after the Syrian civil war escalated in 2011. The U.S. government's ability to bring Syrian refugees to the country was governed by the Refugee Act of 1980, which established the process for admitting refugees, including background checks. Therefore, the claim that the 2013 immigration bill expanded President Obama's ability to bring Syrian refugees without mandating meaningful background checks is false.

Answer: 0"
488,"Explanation: The claim that federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts is not accurate. While federal employees often have higher salaries than private sector employees, the difference is not typically twice as much.

Answer: 0"
489,"Explanation: As of the latest data available, Latinos do not make up the majority population in Texas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2020, the largest ethnic group in Texas is White (42.4%), followed by Hispanic or Latino (39.8%), and then Black or African American (12.8%). Therefore, the claim that Latinos now make up the majority population in Texas is false.

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker did propose a law that would provide a two-year tax exemption for businesses that move into the state, but this law was not passed.

492,"Explanation: The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is a complex set of laws and regulations that govern the tax system in the United States. It is estimated to be around 70,000 pages long. The Bible, on the other hand, is a religious text that is approximately 780,000 words long. Therefore, the claim that there are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible is false.

Answer: 0"
493,"Explanation: The claim that ""Most voters prefer zombies to the current U.S. Congress"" is not based on any credible polling data or scientific research. It is a hyperbolic and humorous statement that does not reflect the actual preferences of voters. The statement is likely intended to be a joke or a commentary on the public's dissatisfaction with the current political climate, rather than a factual claim.

Answer: 0"
494,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the wealthiest counties in the United States are not concentrated in and around the Washington, D.C. area. The top 10 wealthiest counties by median income are spread across various states, including California, New York, and Texas. For example, the wealthiest county in the U.S. is Loudoun County, Virginia, which is near Washington, D.C., but the other top counties are not in the same area.

Answer: 0"
495,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not promise to cut the deficit by half by the end of his first term. Instead, he promised to reduce the deficit by half over the next decade.

Answer: 0"
496,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama carried Congressional District 13 by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012 is false. The 2008 election results for Congressional District 13 show that Obama won by a margin of 10.5 points, not 8.2. In 2012, he won by a margin of 11.3 points, not 5.6. These figures can be verified through official election results from the Federal Election Commission or other reputable sources.

Answer: 0"
497,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""We are not producing jobs"" contradicts the claim that ""We created 80,000 jobs last month."" If the government or company in question created 80,000 jobs, then they are indeed producing jobs. The claim also implies that the net job creation is negative, which is not supported by the statement that 80,000 jobs were created.

Answer: 0"
498,"Explanation: The claim that ""we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend"" is a misinterpretation of the national debt. The national debt refers to the total amount of money that the U.S. government owes to its creditors. When the government spends more money than it collects in taxes, it borrows money to cover the difference. However, this does not mean that every dollar spent is borrowed. The claim is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
499,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the promise Delta Air Lines made to the person or the people of Memphis. Without concrete information, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, it cannot be determined if Delta Air Lines has indeed broken a promise.

Answer: 0"
500,"Explanation: The claim is false. The wealthiest counties in the United States are typically measured by median household income, not by the number of counties in a specific area. The Washington, D.C., area is indeed home to some of the wealthiest counties in the country, but it is not accurate to say that seven of the top ten wealthiest counties are in this area. The top ten wealthiest counties in the U.S. are often found in states like California, New York, and Texas, and the specific counties can vary depending on the source and the year of the data.

Answer: 0"
501,"Explanation: Refugees undergo a more rigorous screening process than the average tourist in the U.S. This is due to the fact that refugees are subject to a more extensive vetting process, including interviews, background checks, and security screenings, to ensure they do not pose a threat to national security. In contrast, tourists typically only need to provide basic information and may not undergo the same level of scrutiny.

Answer: 1"
502,"Explanation: While water transportation is indeed one of the most fuel-efficient and least polluting means of moving cargo, it is not necessarily the safest or least expensive. Safety can vary depending on the type of waterway and the specific conditions of the voyage. Additionally, water transportation can be expensive due to factors such as port fees, vessel maintenance, and the need for specialized equipment. Therefore, the claim that water transportation is the ""safest"" and ""least expensive"" is not accurate.

503,"Explanation: The claim that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is false. According to the Oregon Secretary of State's website, the voter turnout for the 2008 general election in Oregon was approximately 75.5%. Therefore, the claim that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
504,"Explanation: The claim states that ""about 7 in 10 of Oregon's inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses."" To verify this, I would need to check the latest statistics from a reliable source such as the Oregon Department of Corrections or the Bureau of Justice Statistics. However, based on general trends and available data, it is known that a significant portion of inmates in the United States are incarcerated for violent crimes and serious sex offenses. Without specific data for Oregon, it is difficult to confirm the exact percentage, but it is plausible that a substantial number of inmates in Oregon fall into these categories.

Answer: 1"
505,"Explanation: The claim is false. Harry Reid, who served as the Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2015, was known to have a contentious relationship with John McCain, but he did not publicly express his dislike for McCain in the way described in the claim. The quote attributed to Reid is not accurate.

506,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has plans to push legislation that would allow the state to declare financial martial law and take over municipal governments is false. There is no evidence or credible source supporting this claim. Walker's administration has not proposed or implemented any such legislation. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or fabrication of his policies.

Answer: 0"
507,"Explanation: The claim that the Fair Tax will be like waving a magic wand releasing us from pain and unfairness is hyperbolic and misleading. The Fair Tax, also known as the FairTax Act, is a proposed tax reform that would replace the current income tax system with a national sales tax. While proponents argue that it could simplify the tax code and reduce the tax burden on lower-income individuals, it also has significant drawbacks, such as potentially increasing the tax burden on lower-income individuals due to the regressive nature of a sales tax, and it does not address all forms of economic inequality or unfairness. Therefore, the claim that it will release us from all pain and unfairness is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
508,"Explanation: The claim states that Governor Carcieri has not been campaigning with the speaker. Without specific context or evidence, it is difficult to verify the truth of this claim. However, if the speaker is a political figure and the claim is made in a public or official setting, it could be considered true if there is no evidence to the contrary.

Answer: 1"
509,"Explanation: The claim states that U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago. This claim is false because it is not typical for a legislator to oppose a vote on their own legislation. If a legislator introduces a bill, they typically support it and advocate for its passage. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the legislative process.

Answer: 0"
510,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Crist sent his 'top policy staffer to the House Committee to testify in support of the proposal,' then vetoed the bill"" implies that Crist initially supported the proposal but later changed his mind. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Crist's top policy staffer testified in support of the proposal, nor is there any indication that he later vetoed the bill. Therefore, the claim is not supported by facts.

Answer: 0"
511,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, the average annual expenditure on health care for a family was approximately $4,000. This figure is significantly lower than the $13,000 claimed in the statement.

According to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as of 2021, approximately 41.5 million Americans were receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which is the program commonly referred to as food stamps. The claim is exaggerated by 1.5 million.

However, without access to this specific data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
517,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Senate Finance Committee bill, which is a legislative document, does not have a ""report"" by the health insurance industry. The bill is a legislative proposal, and any analysis or critique of it would come from various sources, including news outlets, think tanks, or advocacy groups, but not from the health insurance industry itself.

Answer: 1"
519,"Explanation: In the United States, the practice of checking the immigration status of individuals during routine traffic stops or other arrests is a contentious issue. While some states have laws that allow police officers to check immigration status, others have laws that prohibit such checks. The specific rights of police officers in this regard can vary significantly depending on the state and the context of the arrest. Therefore, the claim that ""Police officers in this state have that right, to check the immigration status of people they arrest"" is not universally true and depends on the specific state and its laws.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the most common reasons for children entering foster care are neglect (50.9%), parental substance abuse (28.5%), and physical abuse (10.7%). The claim overstates the percentage of children in foster care due to parental drug involvement.

Answer: 0"
522,"Explanation: The claim is false.

Additionally, the claim that the person created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man, woman, and child in America is not supported by any credible sources. The U.S. government has been working on smallpox vaccine distribution and production, but there is no evidence to support the claim that an individual created enough vaccine to vaccinate the entire population.

This claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
525,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the compromise tax agreement. The agreement does not mean that 99.7% of American families will not pay any estate tax. Instead, it means that the estate tax exemption is increased, so only the wealthiest estates will be subject to the tax. The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
526,"Explanation: The claim that millennials are more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans is not accurate. According to various polls and surveys, millennials tend to be more liberal on social issues, including abortion.

530,"Explanation: The claim is generally true. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls were relatively flat from 2007 to 2021, with some fluctuations but no significant upward trend.

534,"Explanation: The claim that Obama voted to support President Bush between 40 and 50 percent of the time over the past two years is false. Barack Obama served as the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017, and George W. Bush was the President from 2001 to 2009. Therefore, there was no overlap in their presidencies, and Obama did not vote to support Bush during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
535,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Democratic proposal for a government-controlled health care plan, often referred to as Medicare for All, does not aim to deprive Americans of their current health care coverage. Instead, it seeks to expand access to health care by providing a public option that would compete with private insurance plans. The proposal does not target or aim to eliminate existing private health insurance plans. The claim of depriving 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage is a misrepresentation of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
536,"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is responsible for the roughly $7,800 in property taxes per year is false. Property taxes are levied by local governments, including cities, counties, and school districts, to fund public services. The mayor of a city has some influence over the budget and tax rates, but they are not directly responsible for the amount of property taxes an individual pays. The tax rate and the amount of property taxes paid are determined by the city council and other local governing bodies, not the mayor.

Answer: 0"
537,"Explanation: The claim is made by a person who is not identified as Houston's mayor. Without specific information about who made the claim and their role in Houston's job growth, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
538,"Explanation: The claim that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters knew that they were planning to take over the country and attack it is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. The FBI investigation into the San Bernardino shooting did not find any evidence that the shooters had plans to take over the country or attack it. The neighbors of the shooters did not report any such plans to the authorities.

Answer: 0"
539,"Explanation: According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the leading cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin is suicide, followed by unintentional injuries (which include drug overdoses). While opioid-related deaths are a significant public health issue, they are not the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin.

Answer: 0"
540,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Texas Supreme Court's website, the majority of justices have prior judicial experience. As of 2021, out of the 150 justices who have served on the Texas Supreme Court, only a small fraction had no prior judicial experience. The claim exaggerates the number of justices with no prior experience.

Answer: 0"
541,"Explanation: The claim that the incidents of threats against President Barack Obama are greater than for any other president in modern times is not accurate. While President Obama did face several threats and assassination attempts during his presidency, the number of threats he faced is not unprecedented compared to other modern presidents. For instance, President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt, and President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Therefore, the claim that Obama faced more threats than any other modern president is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
542,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific proposal by President Obama in 2011, which was a spending freeze for non-defense discretionary spending. This freeze was intended to reduce the growth of the federal budget, but it did not affect the overall spending levels for the period from 2011 to 2020. The claim that the spending freeze would only reduce the $42 trillion in government spending by little more than one-half of 1 percent is accurate because the spending freeze was a temporary measure that did not significantly impact the overall spending trend over the decade.

Answer: 1"
543,"Explanation: The claim that there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day is highly unlikely. The process of creating and implementing new laws typically involves a lengthy process that includes legislative proposals, committee reviews, debates, and approvals. It is not feasible for 40,000 new laws to be enacted in a single day. This claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinformation.

Answer: 0"
544,"Explanation: At the beginning of World War II, the United Kingdom had a significantly larger army than Portugal. The UK had a standing army of around 200,000 troops, while Portugal had a much smaller army, with estimates ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 troops. Therefore, the claim that the UK had a relatively small army, smaller than Portugal's, is false.

Answer: 0"
545,"Explanation: The claim states that ""Were within 600 miles of 60 percent of America."" This is a geographical claim that can be evaluated by looking at the population distribution and the distances involved. The United States has a population of approximately 331 million people. If we consider 60 percent of the population, that would be around 200 million people. If we assume a uniform distribution, 600 miles would cover a significant portion of the country, but it's not accurate to say that 60 percent of the population is within 600 miles of a specific location. The claim is vague and does not provide specific data or context to support the claim.

Answer: 0"
546,"Explanation: The claim about state budget cuts resulting in nearly 4,000 educator layoffs is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess the truth of this claim, I would need specific data or sources that confirm the number of educator layoffs and the direct correlation to state budget cuts. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified.

Answer: 0"
547,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific gun bill before the Senate that is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners. The most recent significant gun legislation, such as the Bipartisan Gun Violence Prevention Act of 2023, has focused on measures like background checks, red flag laws, and other provisions aimed at reducing gun violence, but not universal registration of firearms.

Answer: 0"
548,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the U.S. added 431,000 jobs in February 2021, making it the top job creator for that month. However, the claim that the U.S. is now the No. 4 job creator in the last year is incorrect. The U.S. has been the top job creator in the last year, with a total of 10.6 million jobs added from March 2020 to February 2021.

Answer: 0"
549,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia has recovered more than $60 million that was lost to Medicaid fraud is true. According to a report from the Georgia Department of Community Health, the state has recovered over $60 million in Medicaid fraud since 2010. This includes funds recovered through investigations, audits, and prosecutions.

Answer: 1"
550,"Explanation: The claim ""This is a test of the fact-checking widget"" is a statement about the purpose of the current interaction, which is to test the functionality of a fact-checking widget. Since the purpose of the statement is to inform about the test, it is not a claim about a factual event or statement that can be verified as true or false. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a true or false claim.

Answer: 0"
551,"Explanation: The claim that the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets and resulted in a decrease in murder and violent crime rates for eight consecutive years is misleading. The bill in question is the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, not Joe Biden. The act did not add 100,000 cops but rather provided funding for local law enforcement agencies. Additionally, while there was a decrease in violent crime rates in the 1990s, it is not accurate to attribute this solely to the Biden Crime Bill. Multiple factors, including changes in policing strategies, demographic shifts, and economic conditions, contributed to the decline in crime rates.

Answer: 0"
552,"Explanation: The claim is false. While Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA) did make some changes to Medicare, it did not cut Medicare benefits for seniors. The ACA actually expanded Medicare benefits for seniors by providing preventive care services without cost-sharing and closing the Medicare Part D ""doughnut hole."" The claim that only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors is incorrect because other presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, have made changes to Medicare that could be seen as cuts or reductions in benefits.

Answer: 0"
553,"Explanation: The claim that having a baby is a leading cause of poverty in the United States is not accurate. While it is true that having children can increase the financial burden on a family, it is not the leading cause of poverty. Poverty in the United States is primarily driven by factors such as lack of education, unemployment, underemployment, and systemic issues like racial and gender-based wage gaps, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate social safety nets. Having a baby can exacerbate existing financial struggles, but it is not the primary cause of poverty.

Answer: 0"
554,"Explanation: The claim that you have to get a license to fish on our beaches is generally false. In many places, including the United States, you do not need a license to fish from the shore. However, there are some exceptions and regulations that may apply, such as size limits, daily bag limits, and specific gear restrictions. It's always a good idea to check local regulations or contact a local fishing authority for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Answer: 0"
555,"Explanation: The claim is true. Minnesota has had Republicans in control of at least one part of the government for most of the time since 2007, with the exception of 2007-2008 and 2011-2012. Wisconsin, on the other hand, had Democrats controlling both legislative chambers and the governorship from 2011 to 2017.

Answer: 1"
556,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island voters are moving away from the Democratic party to non-affiliation is based on a trend observed in recent elections. According to the latest data from the Rhode Island Secretary of State's office, there has been a significant increase in the number of unaffiliated voters in the state. This trend suggests that a portion of voters who previously identified as Democrats are now choosing to register as unaffiliated. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that all Democrats are leaving the party; rather, it indicates a shift in voter registration patterns.

Answer: 1"
557,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of elections and the number of incumbents defeated can vary greatly depending on the specific states and years in question. The claim does not provide specific details about the states or years involved, making it impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim that only three incumbents have been defeated in 420 elections is highly unlikely and suggests a lack of understanding of the typical outcomes of state legislative elections.

Answer: 0"
558,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama doubled the deficit is misleading. While it is true that the U.S. federal deficit increased significantly during Obama's presidency, it is not accurate to say that he doubled it. The deficit increased from $1.08 trillion in 2008 to $1.4 trillion in 2012, which is an increase of about 30%, not a doubling. Additionally, the deficit was largely driven by the economic crisis and the subsequent stimulus packages, not solely by Obama's policies.

Answer: 0"
559,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan is false. John McCain, a Republican, was a strong advocate for a surge of troops in Afghanistan during his time as a senator and was critical of President Obama's withdrawal strategy. There is no evidence to suggest that McCain has changed his position on this issue.

Answer: 0"
560,"Explanation: The claim that most serial killers and people who commit domestic violence start off by abusing animals is not supported by empirical evidence. While there are some cases where individuals who abuse animals also go on to commit other forms of violence, this is not a universal pattern. The correlation between animal abuse and other forms of violence is not strong enough to make the claim that ""most"" of these individuals start off by abusing animals.

Answer: 0"
561,"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland supported giving $150 billion to the Iranian regime is false. Ted Strickland, a former governor of Ohio, has not been involved in any policy decisions regarding the Iranian regime or any financial support for it. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his political stance.

Answer: 0"
562,"Explanation: The claim is false. The DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) is a proposed law that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The claim that the DREAM Act would grant lower tuition to undocumented immigrants is a misinterpretation of the act. The DREAM Act does not specifically address tuition rates, and it does not provide lower tuition rates to undocumented immigrants. The claim is a distortion of the facts surrounding the DREAM Act.

Answer: 0"
563,"Explanation: The claim about possibly raising the Social Security retirement age is true. The Social Security Administration has been discussing and considering changes to the retirement age due to the increasing life expectancy and the need to ensure the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. This is a topic of ongoing debate and discussion in the United States.

Answer: 1"
564,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican-authored state budget in question does not include a provision forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance. The claim is a misinterpretation of the budget's provisions, which primarily focus on expanding access to health insurance through the marketplace and potentially increasing the number of people eligible for subsidies.

Answer: 0"
565,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the bipartisan task force or its existence. Without concrete information or a reliable source, it is impossible to verify the claim's authenticity.

Answer: 0"
566,"Explanation: The claim is false. While there has been significant construction of new oil and gas pipelines in recent years, the claim that the total length of these pipelines is enough to circle the Earth and then some is an exaggeration. The Earth's circumference is approximately 40,075 kilometers (24,901 miles). The total length of new pipelines constructed in the past three years is not enough to exceed this distance.

Answer: 0"
567,"Explanation: The claim is about the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and its benchmarks. The GAO is a federal agency that provides independent, objective analysis to Congress and the public. The claim states that three out of 18 benchmarks have been fulfilled, which implies a failure. However, the claim does not provide specific details about which benchmarks were fulfilled or what the criteria for success are. Without specific details, it is difficult to verify the claim's accuracy. Additionally, the claim mentions ""Republican math,"" which suggests a political bias, but this does not affect the factuality of the claim.

Answer: 0"
568,"Explanation: The claim is true. President Barack Obama did indeed make statements about ISIS (or ISIL) being contained, specifically in the context of its geographic expansion in Iraq and Syria. For instance, in a 2015 press conference, he stated, ""We have contained ISIL's expansion in Iraq and Syria."" This statement was made in response to the situation on the ground at that time, indicating that the containment was a specific response to the geographic spread of ISIS in those regions.

Answer: 1"
569,"Explanation: The claim states that ""earmarks have come down significantly, 75 percent."" However, without specific context or data to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Earmarks are typically government funds allocated for specific projects or programs, and their reduction could be due to various reasons such as budget cuts, policy changes, or shifts in government priorities. To accurately evaluate this claim, one would need to refer to official government reports, budget documents, or other reliable sources that provide specific data on the reduction of earmarks.

Answer: 0"
570,"Explanation: The claim that 2010 was the worst year ever for America's doctors reimbursed by Medicare is not accurate. While 2010 did see a significant reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates, it was not the worst year ever. In fact, the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, which was used to determine reimbursement rates, led to a 21.4% reduction in 2010. However, this was not the largest reduction in history. The largest reduction occurred in 2003, when the SGR formula led to a 4.4% reduction. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
571,"Explanation: The claim that ""regulations have quadrupled"" under a specific president is not accurate. According to the Mercatus Center's study, the number of new regulations issued by the federal government has not quadrupled. The study found that the number of new regulations issued by the federal government has increased by about 10% under this president, which is not a quadrupling.

Answer: 0"
572,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are advisers within Obama's campaign who are anti-Israel. While it is true that some individuals associated with Obama's campaign have expressed views critical of Israeli policies, it is not accurate to label them as ""anti-Israel"" in a blanket statement. The claim is an oversimplification and lacks nuance. It is important to note that political views are complex and cannot be reduced to a single label.

Answer: 0"
573,"Explanation: The claim is true. During the Great Recession of 2008, corporate profits indeed declined significantly. However, by 2010, two years after the recession, corporate profits began to recover and eventually surpassed pre-recession levels. This recovery was driven by various factors, including increased productivity, cost-cutting measures, and a recovering economy.

Answer: 1"
574,"Explanation: The claim is false. The president did not propose eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers. In fact, the proposed tax reform in 2017, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, did not eliminate charitable deductions but rather increased the standard deduction, which could reduce the number of people who itemize their deductions, including charitable donations.

Answer: 0"
575,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has been the subject of numerous claims about his financial dealings, including allegations of having millions in the Cayman Islands. However, these claims have been widely debunked. Romney has publicly disclosed his tax returns, which show that he has not hidden millions in offshore accounts. The claim that he had millions in the Cayman Islands is a misrepresentation of his financial situation.

Answer: 0"
576,"Explanation: The claim ""There is already a mosque four blocks away"" cannot be verified without specific context or additional information. The truthfulness of this claim depends on the location and the definition of ""four blocks"" in the context of the statement. It could be true or false depending on the exact location and the distance measurement used.

Answer: 0/1"
577,"Explanation: The claim ""He reformed welfare before others tried"" is vague and lacks specific context. It does not provide enough information to determine who ""he"" is, what ""welfare"" refers to, or what ""others"" are. Without this context, it is impossible to verify the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0"
578,"Explanation: The claim that 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay is not accurate. While eBay is a significant platform for many people to sell items and make money, the number of people who make their primary living off eBay is much lower. According to various studies and reports, the number of people who rely on eBay for their primary income is in the tens of thousands, not millions.

Answer: 0"
579,"Explanation: The claim that Northern Virginia is the most heavily trafficked place in the country is not accurate. While Northern Virginia, particularly the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, does experience heavy traffic due to its proximity to the nation's capital and major highways, it is not the most heavily trafficked place in the country. That distinction typically goes to areas with high population densities and major transportation hubs, such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
580,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan's proposal, known as the ""Ryan Budget,"" did not limit Medicare spending to $15,000 per person. Instead, it proposed converting Medicare into a premium support system, where beneficiaries would receive a fixed amount of money to purchase private health insurance plans. The $15,000 figure is a misinterpretation of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
581,"Explanation: The claim about 25 million to 30 million people being allowed to access a national health insurance exchange is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been in effect since 2014 and has provided health insurance to millions of Americans through the Health Insurance Marketplace. However, the claim of a specific number of people being allowed to access the exchange is not accurate and does not reflect the reality of the ACA's implementation.

Answer: 0"
582,"Explanation: The claim states that Oregon has had unemployment higher than the national average for 17 years. To verify this, I would need to check historical unemployment data for Oregon and the United States. However, without specific data points, it's challenging to confirm the claim. Typically, unemployment rates fluctuate over time, and it's possible for a state to have higher unemployment than the national average for extended periods. Therefore, without concrete data, it's difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
583,"Explanation: John McCain has not proposed to keep the estate tax at 0 percent. In fact, he has previously supported the repeal of the estate tax, but his stance on this issue has evolved over time. As of my last update, there is no specific proposal from John McCain to keep the estate tax at 0 percent.

Answer: 0"
584,"Explanation: The claim is false. Anthony Gemma, a former Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010, has consistently identified as pro-life. There is no evidence to suggest that he has changed his stance to pro-choice.

Answer: 0"
585,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Scott has teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist is a complex one. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified evidence to support this specific claim. The claim is not substantiated by credible news sources or official records. Therefore, it is likely to be a false or unfounded claim.

Answer: 0"
586,"Explanation: The claim that ""there is not one Democrat who endorses the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan"" is false. While it is true that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan, which proposed to replace Medicare with a voucher system, was not widely endorsed by Democrats, there were some Democrats who expressed support for certain aspects of the plan or were open to negotiations. For instance, some Democrats, such as Senator Joe Lieberman, were open to discussing a voucher system as part of a broader healthcare reform package. Therefore, the claim that ""there is not one Democrat who endorses the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan"" is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
587,"Explanation: The claim that the United States death rate is two-and-a-half times higher for those who do not have a high school education is based on a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study found that individuals without a high school diploma had a mortality rate that was approximately 2.5 times higher than those with a high school diploma or higher. This indicates that the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
588,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about a specific area (McAllen) and its constituents. To verify this claim, one would need to refer to reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Census Bureau, or local health department reports. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
589,"Explanation: The claim that Switzerland and the Netherlands cover all their citizens using private insurers and do so for much less cost is misleading. Both countries have universal healthcare systems, but they differ in their approach to funding and delivery. In Switzerland, the healthcare system is primarily funded through a mix of public and private insurance, with the government setting minimum coverage requirements. The Netherlands also has a universal healthcare system, but it is funded through a combination of public and private insurance, with the government regulating the market to ensure affordability and accessibility. While these systems may have lower costs compared to some other countries, they are not entirely private insurers covering all citizens.

Answer: 0"
590,"Explanation: The claim that ExxonMobil made $19 billion in profit last year and paid zero in taxes, receiving a $156 million refund from the IRS, is false. While it is true that ExxonMobil has reported significant profits, the claim about paying zero taxes and receiving a refund is misleading. Corporations can receive tax refunds if they overpay their taxes, but this does not mean they paid zero in taxes. The claim is likely an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the company's tax situation.

Answer: 0"
591,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is acting without consultation or input from the company to stop the sale of Buckyballs. However, the CPSC typically follows a process that includes consultation with manufacturers and other stakeholders before taking regulatory actions. The claim does not provide specific evidence or sources to support the assertion that the CPSC is acting without consultation. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: 0"
592,"Explanation: The claim is true. Many states in the United States have been cutting back on funding for public television. For example, in 2021, several states such as California, Texas, and Florida reduced their funding for public broadcasting. This trend is not unique to a single state but is a broader phenomenon affecting multiple states.

Answer: 1"
593,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the United States has one of the highest vaccination rates among developed countries. However, some African countries have also achieved high vaccination rates, particularly in the context of COVID-19. For example, countries like Rwanda and Seychelles have had high vaccination rates due to their effective public health strategies and international support. Therefore, while it is true that some African countries have higher vaccination rates than others, it is not accurate to say that all African countries have higher rates than the United States.

Answer: 0"
594,"Explanation: The claim ""On support for the Bridge to Nowhere"" is ambiguous and does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. The term ""Bridge to Nowhere"" is often used to describe a project that is not needed or is a waste of resources, but without additional context, it's impossible to say whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
595,"Explanation: The claim that ""For decades, the states gas tax has been among the highest in the nation"" is not accurate. While some states do have high gas taxes, it is not accurate to say that this has been the case for decades. Gas tax rates vary by state and can change over time. For example, in 2021, California had the highest gas tax rate in the nation, but other states have had higher rates in the past. Therefore, the claim is not true.

Answer: 0"
596,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the Colorado Department of Revenue, the state collected $60.7 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the fiscal year 2021, which ended in June 2021. This information is available on the department's official website.

Answer: 1"
597,"Explanation: The claim that small businesses are going out of business in record numbers is not accurate. While it is true that many small businesses have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall trend is not as severe as the claim suggests. According to various reports and studies, while there has been an increase in business closures, the rate is not unprecedented and is not at record levels. The Small Business Administration (SBA) and other sources have reported that while many businesses have closed, the overall number of closures is not at an all-time high.

Answer: 0"
598,"Explanation: The claim is true. Some members of the House of Representatives have received farm subsidies, and there have been instances where these same members have proposed cuts to food stamps. For example, in 2018, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) received $1.2 million in farm subsidies but voted to cut food stamps. This is a well-documented issue in U.S. politics.

Answer: 1"
599,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support the claim that U.S. Representatives John Barrow and Sanford Bishop, or any other Democrats, went on a spending spree and maxed out their credit cards. This claim appears to be a baseless accusation without any factual basis.

Answer: 0"
600,"Explanation: The claim is false. The weight of turkeys has indeed increased over time due to selective breeding and improved feeding practices. However, the specific weights provided in the claim are not accurate. According to the National Turkey Federation, the average weight of a turkey in the United States in 2020 was around 16 pounds, which is significantly higher than the 13.2 pounds claimed for the 1930s. The 29.8 pounds claimed for today's turkeys is also not accurate, as the average weight of a turkey in 2020 was around 16 pounds.

Answer: 0"
601,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not change her position on the India nuclear deal. In 2006, she supported the deal, and in 2008, she continued to support it. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation of her stance on the deal.

Answer: 0"
602,"Explanation: The claim is false. The $60 billion approved by Congress in response to Hurricane Sandy was not solely for disaster relief. The funds were allocated to various purposes, including infrastructure repair, housing assistance, and economic recovery. The 10 percent figure is misleading as it suggests that only 10 percent of the funds were used for disaster relief, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
603,"Explanation: The claim is false. The President has indeed taken executive actions on immigration, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for certain countries. However, these actions have been challenged in court, and the President has not claimed that he did not have the constitutional power to take them. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the President's statements and actions.

Answer: 0"
604,"Explanation: The claim about public financing of his campaign is not specific enough to be evaluated as true or false. It could refer to various candidates and campaigns, and without additional context, it's impossible to determine the veracity of the claim.

Answer: 0"
605,"Explanation: The claim is generally true. The U.S. tax system is progressive, meaning that higher-income individuals typically pay a higher effective tax rate than lower-income individuals. The top 1% of earners in the U.S. often pay an effective tax rate of around 20-30%, while the middle class, which typically falls into the 15% and 25% income tax brackets, also faces payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes) that can add up to around 7.65% of their income. Therefore, the claim that the mega-rich pay about 15 percent in taxes while the middle class is hit with heavy payroll taxes is accurate.

Answer: 1"
606,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's estimate of a $3.6 billion state budget deficit is manufactured and a bogus figure is false. The Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, an independent state agency, has confirmed that the state faces a budget deficit of $3.6 billion for the 2021-2023 biennium. This figure is based on the state's revenue projections and spending plans, and it is not a manufactured or bogus figure.

Answer: 0"
607,"Explanation: The claim that children born today will carry a $30,000 share of the national debt is false. The national debt is a collective responsibility of the country, and it is not accurately divided among individuals based on their birth year. The debt is managed by the government and is not directly attributable to any specific individual or generation.

Answer: 0"
608,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are both regulatory agencies in the United States, but they have different jurisdictions. The USDA primarily regulates meat, poultry, and egg products, while the FDA regulates most other foods, including sandwiches. The number of slices of bread in a sandwich does not change the regulatory agency responsible for it.

610,"Explanation: The Buffett Rule, proposed by Warren Buffett, is a tax policy that would impose a minimum tax rate on individuals with very high incomes. The claim that the Buffett Rule would bring in less than $5 billion per year is false. The Buffett Rule is designed to ensure that high-income individuals pay a minimum tax rate, and estimates suggest that it could generate significant revenue. For example, a 2012 analysis by the Congressional Research Service estimated that the Buffett Rule could generate around $50 billion in revenue annually. Therefore, the claim that it would bring in less than $5 billion per year is inaccurate.

612,"Explanation: The claim that one-third of the healthcare dollar goes to insurance companies is a misinterpretation of the actual distribution of healthcare costs. The claim is often used to argue against the high cost of healthcare insurance, but it is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in 2019, about 34% of healthcare spending was for private health insurance, not one-third. The remaining 66% was for Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs, as well as out-of-pocket spending by patients. Therefore, the claim is false.

According to the Federal Reserve, the total assets of the six largest U.S. banks (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) were approximately $12.5 trillion in 2021. The GDP of the United States in 2021 was around $22.9 trillion. Therefore, the assets of these six banks are approximately 55% of the GDP, not 60%.

618,"Explanation: The claim suggests that bus riders are subsidizing the Leander-to-Austin train, implying that the train's costs are being covered by bus riders. However, this is not accurate.

620,"Explanation: Drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and in parts of Alaska can indeed increase domestic oil production, which can help reduce dependence on foreign oil. However, it's important to note that this process takes time. Oil exploration and production can take several years from discovery to actual production. Additionally, the claim that it will ""immediately"" reduce dependence is an oversimplification. While increased domestic production can help, it's not a quick fix. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
631,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25 per hour, not $7.75. The poverty level for a single person in 2021 was $12,880 per year, or $107.33 per month. At a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, a full-time worker would earn $15,080 per year, which is above the poverty level.

Answer: 0"
632,"Explanation: The claim that Jasper County in Texas raised property taxes by 7 percent to pay for one death penalty case is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim.

643,"Explanation: The claim that students who receive free or reduced lunch are performing just as well as students who do not is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some students receiving free or reduced lunch may perform well, research has shown that there is often a correlation between socioeconomic status and academic achievement. Students from lower-income backgrounds may face additional challenges such as lack of resources, unstable housing, and increased stress, which can negatively impact their academic performance. Therefore, while there are exceptions, the claim that these students perform just as well as those from higher-income backgrounds is an oversimplification.

655,"Explanation: The claim is about the political stance of Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson, and John McCain regarding the marriage amendment. As of my last update in October 2023, Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson are not prominent figures in the current political landscape, and their views on the marriage amendment are not widely known or reported. John McCain, a former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate, was known for his support of traditional marriage and was a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage. However, the claim does not specify the exact amendment or the context, making it difficult to definitively judge the claim's truthfulness without more specific information.

658,"Explanation: The claim that the law has not established whether Rhode Island public employees have property rights to their pensions is false. In Rhode Island, public employees do have property rights to their pensions. This is established by law, specifically in the Rhode Island General Laws, Section 16-13-1, which states that public employees have a vested right in their pensions.

662,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) will cause up to 20 million Americans to lose the insurance they currently have and want to keep is misleading. While it's true that some people may lose their insurance due to changes in eligibility or affordability, the overall impact is more nuanced. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage, not to reduce it. Many people who were previously uninsured or had inadequate coverage have gained access to better insurance options through the ACA. The claim of 20 million people losing insurance is often cited in the context of the individual mandate and the potential for increased premiums, but it's important to note that these changes were intended to balance the system and ensure that everyone had access to affordable healthcare.

Answer: 0"
663,"Explanation: The claim that 90 percent of job growth since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed has been in full-time positions is not accurate.

665,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is a healthcare reform law that was passed in 2010. It does not give bureaucrats the authority to decide whether individuals receive care such as dialysis or cancer chemotherapy.

Decisions about medical treatment are made by healthcare providers, not bureaucrats.

Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has lifted the embargo and allowed travel to Cuba is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
674,"Explanation: During Mitt Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, the state's budget did indeed decrease in size. However, it's important to note that this was primarily due to a decrease in spending on social services and education, rather than a broad-based reduction in government size. Additionally, the state's budget was also influenced by federal stimulus funds during the recession. Therefore, while there was a reduction in government spending, it is not accurate to say that the rate of growth of the government was slowed or that it was cut overall.

Answer: 0"
675,"Explanation: The claim is false. John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was known for his strong support of free trade and opposed protectionist measures. He was a co-sponsor of the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2015, which gave the president the power to negotiate trade agreements.

Answer: 0"
676,"Explanation: The claim states that both women and men are making less when adjusted for inflation compared to when John Kitzhaber was first elected governor. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical data on wages and inflation rates. However, without specific data points or a clear reference to the time period in question, it is challenging to verify the claim. Typically, wage adjustments for inflation are calculated using indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). If the claim is based on a specific study or data set, it would need to be referenced to confirm its accuracy.

Instead, they aimed to reduce emissions by encouraging the use of cleaner energy sources and improving efficiency. Therefore, the claim is false.

The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of regulations related to public health and safety, which are more broadly applicable to public restrooms and not specifically to toilet seats.

Answer: 0"
682,"Explanation: The claim that Austin has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded is not accurate. While Austin has experienced significant growth over the years, the rate of doubling every 25 years is an exaggeration. Austin's population growth has been steady but not exponential. For instance, in the 1970s, Austin's population was around 300,000, and by the 2000s, it had grown to around 700,000, which is a significant increase but not a doubling every 25 years.

690,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the New York State Governor Kathy Hochul in a press release. According to the press release, New York State added 800,000 private sector jobs in 2021, which is a significant increase. The unemployment rate in New York State has been decreasing, and as of the latest data, it is indeed lower than it was before the pandemic. However, the claim that New York State has more private sector jobs than it has ever had in its history is not explicitly stated in the press release. The press release only mentions that the state added 800,000 jobs in 2021, which is a record for the state, but it does not compare this to all-time historical data.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have specific data on the exact amount of attention paid to Chris Christie this week or the coverage of the Benghazi incident. However, the claim suggests a comparison in significance, which is subjective and depends on the context and the source of the information.

The Great Depression period (1929-1939) saw a significant decline in population growth due to the economic crisis and the Dust Bowl, but the current population growth rate is still higher than that period.

Answer: 0"
709,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of deaths from gunfire in the United States since 1968 to the total number of deaths in all of the country's wars throughout its history. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been approximately 1.5 million gun-related deaths in the U.S. since 1968. In contrast, the total number of deaths in all U.S. wars is significantly lower. For example, the Vietnam War alone resulted in approximately 58,000 deaths. Therefore, the claim that more Americans have died from gunfire since 1968 than in all of the country's wars is true.

710,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' website, FreshFromFlorida.com, is primarily focused on providing information about Florida's agriculture, food, and consumer services.

712,"Explanation: Sen. Barack Obama, who later became President Obama, has indeed been consistently rated as pro-choice by organizations such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. However, the claim that he has always had a ""100 percent pro-choice rating"" is a simplification. While he has consistently supported abortion rights, his stance has evolved over time, and he has not always been in favor of all aspects of abortion rights. For example, he has supported restrictions on late-term abortions. Therefore, the claim that he has always had a ""100 percent pro-choice rating"" is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
713,"Explanation: The claim that the federal debt is growing by more than $4 billion a day is not accurate.

728,"Explanation: The claim that ""half our general revenue goes to education"" is not accurate. The percentage of general revenue allocated to education varies by country and can be influenced by various factors such as the specific government's budget priorities, economic conditions, and the overall tax revenue. For example, in the United States, education spending is a significant portion of the federal budget, but it is not exactly half. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in 2020, the federal government spent about 10% of its budget on education, while state and local governments spent a larger portion. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
737,"Explanation: The claim that small businesses create 70 percent of the jobs in America is often cited but is not entirely accurate.

However, the claim that you can simply tow an old car to your house and receive $4,500 is inaccurate. The program required that the old vehicle be traded in for a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle, and the $4,500 was a voucher that could be used towards the purchase of the new vehicle, not a direct payment for the old vehicle.

Answer: 0"
742,"Explanation: The claim that ""Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real"" is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. While it is true that some Republicans have been skeptical about the extent and urgency of climate change, there are also many Republicans who acknowledge that climate change is real and support action to address it. For example, former Republican Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger has been a vocal advocate for climate action. Therefore, the claim is false.

The claim of 28,000 deaths is an exaggeration and not supported by reliable data.

744,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was implemented to increase access to affordable health insurance. While it is true that some people may have lost their insurance due to changes in the law, the overall goal of the ACA was to expand coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsured rate in the U.S. dropped from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2019, indicating that millions more people gained access to insurance. Therefore, the claim that the law denies millions access to affordable insurance is false.

745,"Explanation: The claim that close to 30% of the federal prison population consists of illegal immigrants is not accurate. According to the most recent data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 4.7% of the federal prison population is composed of immigrants who are not U.S. citizens. This percentage includes both those who are in the country illegally and those who are lawful permanent residents or have other immigration statuses. Therefore, the claim significantly overstates the proportion of illegal immigrants in the federal prison population.

In the 1985 election, Tom Kean defeated Jim Florio with a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%, which was indeed a significant margin. However, the claim that this was the largest margin in Jersey history is incorrect. In 1993, Jim Florio defeated Christine Todd Whitman with a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%, which is the same margin as Tom Kean's victory in 1985. Therefore, neither of these elections had the largest margin in Jersey history.

Answer: 0"
750,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare is the biggest tax increase in American history is not accurate. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did introduce several new taxes, such as the individual mandate penalty and the employer mandate, these taxes were not the largest tax increase in American history. For instance, the Revenue Act of 1913, which established the modern income tax system, and the Revenue Act of 1940, which increased taxes to fund World War II, were much larger tax increases. Therefore, the claim is false.

763,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has faced numerous legal challenges, but the claim that twelve judges have thrown out legal challenges because they rejected the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional is inaccurate.

The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the legal process surrounding the ACA.

773,"Explanation: The claim that college tuition has gone up four times the rate of inflation since 1978 is generally accurate. According to data from the College Board, the cost of tuition and fees at public institutions has increased by about 1,041% since 1978, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation, has increased by about 250% over the same period.

Additionally, the ranking of countries by GDP is not a static figure and can change based on various economic factors. Therefore, the claim that Black America would be the 15th wealthiest nation in the world is not accurate.

Answer: 1"
819,"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme is false. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading.

While President Trump did propose tax increases during his presidency, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced corporate and individual tax rates, he did not propose the largest tax increase in American history.

Answer: 0"
822,"Explanation: The claim that earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget is false. Earmarks, which are provisions in legislation that direct funds to specific projects or programs, have been significantly reduced in recent years. In 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 eliminated earmarks for the federal budget, and the amount of money allocated through earmarks has been declining since then. Therefore, the claim that earmarks account for $18-billion of our budget is inaccurate.

833,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rand Paul has not been seen as much in recent times due to various reasons, including his focus on his Senate campaign and his health issues. However, he has not been ""shopping for a billionaire"" to fund his super PAC.

The effectiveness of red light cameras can vary depending on the specific intersection and the implementation of the system. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

It is a general statement that could be interpreted differently depending on the context and the specific policies being discussed. Without concrete evidence or data, it is difficult to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 1"
846,"Explanation: The claim that the current administration and Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control is not accurate. In fact, the Trump administration, which was in power from 2017 to 2021, requested and received significant funding for border security, including the construction of the border wall. The Biden administration has also requested and received funding for border security, although the specifics of how that funding is allocated and used have been a subject of debate and criticism. Therefore, the claim that funding has been systematically cut is misleading.

Answer: 0"
847,"Explanation: Mitt Romney released his tax returns during his 2012 presidential campaign. He released two years of tax returns in 2012, and in 2016, he released his tax returns for the previous two years. Therefore, the claim that he is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns is false.

Answer: 0"
848,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 data, New Hampshire has the lowest property tax rate in the country. Therefore, the claim that New Hampshire has the third-highest property tax in the country is false.

Answer: 0"
849,"Explanation: The claim that Obama's tax plan cuts taxes ""for 95 percent of all working families"" is a simplification and an exaggeration. While the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Obama, did include tax cuts for many Americans, it is not accurate to say that 95 percent of all working families benefited from these cuts. The tax cuts were targeted at lower- and middle-income individuals and families, but the percentage of beneficiaries was not as high as 95 percent.

Answer: 0"
850,"Explanation: The claim that 59 percent of Americans believe Barack Obama is still a Muslim is false. According to various polls and surveys, the majority of Americans do not believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim. For instance, a 2016 poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found that only 11% of Americans believe that Obama is a Muslim. Therefore, the claim that 59 percent of Americans hold this belief is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
851,"Explanation: The claim that Carol Shea-Porter wants to increase taxes on small businesses and job creators is a political statement that can be interpreted differently based on the context and specific policies she has proposed. Without specific details or a clear source, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim. However, if the claim is based on general political rhetoric or specific policy proposals, it would need to be evaluated within that context.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific context or source.)"
852,"Explanation: The claim is false. A bill delaying the start of classes until Labor Day would not necessarily shave 5 full weeks off the school year. The actual number of weeks shaved would depend on the specific dates of Labor Day and the current start date of the school year. Additionally, the claim assumes that the school year would end on the same date as it would have without the delay, which is not necessarily the case.

Answer: 0"
853,"Explanation: The claim about whether the United States should intervene in Libya is a political and strategic question that does not have a definitive true or false answer. It depends on the perspective and the criteria used to evaluate the intervention. For instance, some might argue that intervention is necessary to prevent humanitarian crises or to support democratic movements, while others might argue that it is not in the U.S.'s best interest to intervene due to potential risks, costs, and the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as true or false in an absolute sense.

Answer: 0"
854,"Explanation: The claim is false. Gallup does not conduct polls in Egypt, and there is no evidence to support the claim that 70 percent of Egyptians do not want U.S. money. Gallup is an American polling organization that primarily conducts surveys in the United States and other countries, but not Egypt.

Answer: 0"
855,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statistic from the FBI's crime statistics, which is a reliable source. However, without specific data or context, it's difficult to verify the exact percentage reduction in violent crime during a particular administration. The claim could be true if the data supports it, but it requires further verification.

Answer: 0/1"
856,"Explanation: Scott Maddox has indeed run for several political offices in Florida, including for the Florida Senate and the Florida House of Representatives. However, the claim that he has run ""losing campaigns for 3 of Florida's 4 available cabinet positions"" is misleading. Cabinet positions in Florida are not elected positions but are appointed by the Governor. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Scott Maddox has run for these positions.

Answer: 0"
857,"Explanation: The claim that Americans spend 6.1 billion hours a year on tax preparation is false. According to the IRS, Americans spend an average of 13.5 hours per year on tax preparation. This figure is significantly lower than the claimed 6.1 billion hours.

Answer: 0"
858,"Explanation: The claim that the United States is now energy independent for the first time ever is not accurate. While the U.S. has made significant strides in reducing its dependence on foreign energy sources, it is not entirely energy independent. The U.S. still imports and exports energy, and its energy independence is more about reducing dependence on specific sources rather than being completely self-sufficient. The term ""energy independence"" is often used to describe a situation where a country produces enough energy to meet its own needs without relying on imports from other countries.

Answer: 0"
859,"Explanation: The claim that Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour last year is false. This figure is not accurate and does not reflect the company's actual earnings. Exxon's annual earnings are significantly lower than the claimed hourly figure. For instance, in 2021, Exxon's net income was approximately $19.4 billion, which translates to about $53 million per day or $2.2 million per hour, not $4.7 million per hour.

Answer: 0"
860,"Explanation: The claim states that Republican Sen. John McCain won more votes in Cuyahoga County in the 2008 general election than he did in seven states. This claim is false because it is not possible for McCain to have won more votes in a single county than in seven states. The total number of votes in a county is typically much smaller than the total number of votes in seven states combined.

Answer: 0"
861,"Explanation: The claim states that Peter Kilmartin voted in favor of expanding the good behavior statute to sex offenders. However, there is no specific information provided to verify this claim. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
862,"Explanation: The claim that Occupy Atlanta protesters were allowed to stay in Woodruff Park is false. The Occupy Atlanta movement, which began in 2011, was not permitted to camp in Woodruff Park. The city of Atlanta had restrictions on camping in public parks, and the protesters were eventually removed from the park.

Answer: 0"
863,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of African American men currently in the U.S. criminal justice system (prison, jail, probation, or parole) to the number of enslaved African Americans in 1850. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, as of 2019, there were approximately 2.2 million African American men in the U.S. criminal justice system. In 1850, the U.S. Census reported approximately 3.9 million enslaved African Americans. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
864,"Explanation: The claim that limiting labor negotiations to only wages is how it is for the most part in the private sector is not entirely accurate. While wages are certainly a significant part of labor negotiations, private sector negotiations often also include other aspects such as benefits, working conditions, job security, and other perks. These negotiations can be quite comprehensive and are not limited solely to wages.

Answer: 0"
865,"Explanation: The claim is false. Del Valle, a neighborhood in Austin, Texas, has several grocery stores within its vicinity. The closest grocery stores to Del Valle are located in the area itself, such as H-E-B and Walmart, which are both within a short driving distance. Therefore, residents of Del Valle do not need to drive to Bastrop to access the closest grocery store.

Answer: 0"
866,"Explanation: The claim that Mark Warner voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt is false. Mark Warner has been a consistent advocate for fiscal responsibility and has voted against many of the tax increases and debt increases proposed by the Democratic Party. He has also been critical of excessive government spending and has voted against many of the spending bills proposed by the Democratic Party. Therefore, the claim that he voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt is inaccurate and misleading.

Answer: 0"
867,"Explanation: The claim that a United Nations arms treaty would almost certainly force the U.S. to create an international gun registry and set the stage for full-scale gun confiscation is false. The United Nations has no authority to force the U.S. to create an international gun registry or confiscate guns. The U.S. is not a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), and the treaty does not require any country to create a gun registry or confiscate guns. The ATT is a voluntary agreement that aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, and it does not impose any obligations on non-signatory countries like the U.S.

Answer: 0"
868,"Explanation: The claim that there was ""virtually no international pressure on Iran"" when a certain administration took office is a subjective statement and can be difficult to verify without specific context. However, it is generally accepted that there has been significant international pressure on Iran, particularly regarding its nuclear program and human rights issues. This pressure has been exerted through various means, including economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and international resolutions.

Answer: 0"
869,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the actions taken against the big oil companies. Without concrete evidence or specific examples, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
870,"Explanation: The claim that abortion doctors are flying into a state, performing abortions, and flying out is a common misconception. Abortion services are typically provided by local healthcare providers, and the claim suggests a scenario that is not typical or legal. Abortion doctors are usually part of local healthcare systems and do not travel between states for the purpose of performing abortions.

Answer: 0"
871,"Explanation: The claim that Maurice Ferre says Kendrick Meek has voted 98.6 percent of the time with the Democrat party is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific source or evidence to support this claim. It is possible that Maurice Ferre made such a statement, but without a reliable source or context, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
872,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is dead last in income growth among midwestern states during Gov. Scott Walker's term is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Wisconsin's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was higher than several other midwestern states during Walker's tenure as governor. For example, in 2015, Wisconsin's GDP growth rate was 2.5%, which was higher than states like Illinois (1.8%) and Michigan (1.6%). Therefore, the claim that Wisconsin is dead last in income growth is false.

Answer: 0"
873,"Explanation: The claim about a three-cents-per-ounce soda tax in Philadelphia resulting in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry is based on a study conducted by the Center for Local Government Finance and Policy. The study estimated that a soda tax could lead to job losses in the beverage industry, including those held by Teamsters. However, the specific number of 2,000 jobs is not universally accepted and is subject to debate. The impact of a soda tax on jobs can vary depending on factors such as the size of the tax, the economic conditions in the region, and the response of the beverage industry.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or not definitively true based on the available information.)"
874,"Explanation: The claim ""On repeal of Wisconsin's smoking ban"" is incomplete and lacks specific details about the repeal of the smoking ban. Without additional context or information about the repeal, it is impossible to determine if the claim is true or false. Therefore, the claim cannot be evaluated as either true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
875,"Explanation: The claim is true. John Hagee, a prominent American evangelist, has made controversial statements about Hurricane Katrina and the Catholic Church. In 2005, he stated that Hurricane Katrina was a punishment from God for the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts. He also has criticized the Catholic Church, calling it ""the Antichrist"" and a ""false cult."" These statements were widely reported in the media and are well-documented.

Answer: 1"
876,"Explanation: The claim that 51 percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax is based on a misinterpretation of data. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reports that about 44% of tax filers do not owe any federal income tax because they have no taxable income or their tax credits and deductions exceed their tax liability. However, this does not mean that 51% of filers paid zero tax; it means that 51% of tax filers had no taxable income or their tax credits and deductions covered their tax liability.

Answer: 0"
877,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin has been losing jobs at rates not seen in decades since Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took office is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been relatively stable and has not shown a significant increase since Walker took office in 2011. In fact, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been lower than the national average for much of Walker's tenure. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
878,"Explanation: The claim is false. The last Republican senator from New Jersey was Tom Kean, who served from 1982 to 1989. Since then, no Republican has been elected to the Senate from New Jersey. The claim that you would be the first Republican senator elected in New Jersey in 41 years is incorrect because there have been no Republican senators from New Jersey since 1989.

Answer: 0"
879,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Wisconsin's Attorney General and State Treasurer ordered the daughter of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson to not discuss climate change on state time. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of facts.

Answer: 0"
880,"Explanation: The claim that unions take away hard-earned money from teachers, firefighters, and police officers to play politics is a generalization and often a misrepresentation of the role of unions. Unions primarily exist to negotiate better wages, benefits, and working conditions for their members. The dues collected from members are used to fund these negotiations, legal battles, and other services provided to the members. The idea that these funds are used solely for political purposes is a common misconception. While unions may contribute to political campaigns, this is typically done through separate political action committees (PACs) and is not a primary use of member dues.

Answer: 0"
881,"Explanation: President George W. Bush did indeed conduct interviews with the New York Times during his presidency. For instance, he granted an interview to the New York Times in 2004, which was published on October 10, 2004. Therefore, the claim that he never did one interview with the New York Times during his entire presidency is false.

Answer: 0"
882,"Explanation: The claim that Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign and therefore has no donors is false. Donald Trump has received significant donations from various individuals and organizations throughout his political career. While he has contributed a portion of his own funds to his campaigns, he has also relied on donations from supporters to finance his campaigns.

Answer: 0"
883,"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 2,000 high schools, which is approximately 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States, produce about half of the nation's dropouts. This claim is false because it is not possible for a specific number of schools to produce half of the nation's dropouts. The number of dropouts is distributed across a much larger number of schools, and the claim does not provide any evidence or data to support this specific percentage.

Answer: 0"
884,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Atlanta Housing Authority, which found that approximately 40% of Atlanta households spend more than 30% of their income on rent. This study was published in 2019 and is a reliable source of information. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
885,"Explanation: The claim that the Providence teacher contract is one of the longest in the country is not verifiable with the information provided. Teacher contracts can vary significantly in length and terms across different school districts and states. Without specific data or a comparison with other contracts, it is impossible to determine if the Providence teacher contract is indeed one of the longest in the country.

Answer: 0"
886,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the debt accumulated under the current president to the debt accumulated under all previous presidents combined. This is a complex comparison that requires specific data and context. Without specific data points or a clear definition of ""all those other presidents,"" it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. However, if we consider the total debt accumulated under the current president and compare it to the total debt accumulated under all previous presidents, the claim could be true or false depending on the specific data.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
887,"Explanation: The claim that annual precipitation has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century is not accurate. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average annual precipitation in Rhode Island has increased by about 4 inches over the last century. This increase is consistent with broader trends of increased precipitation in the northeastern United States, but it does not meet the threshold of over 12 inches as stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
888,"Explanation: The claim states that the state budget proposal has been submitted on time and that it is the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades. To verify this claim, I would need to check the official records or news sources to confirm the submission date and compare it with historical data on budget submissions by previous governors. Without this specific information, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information.)"
889,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV (Bureau of Motor Vehicles) is false. Ohio has a process in place to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV. The BMV is required to notify the county board of elections of any address changes, and the county board of elections is responsible for updating the voter registration records. This process ensures that voter registrations are kept up-to-date with the most current address information.

Answer: 0"
890,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the most commonly spoken languages in Texas, after English, are Spanish and Vietnamese. However, Vietnamese is not the third most commonly spoken language in Texas. The third most commonly spoken language is Spanish, followed by Vietnamese, and then other languages like Chinese, French, and German.

Answer: 0"
891,"Explanation: The claim is subjective and depends on personal opinion. The term ""most generous"" and ""good time bill"" are not quantifiable or universally defined. Therefore, it is impossible to objectively verify the claim as true or false without additional context or specific details about the bill in question.

Answer: 0"
892,"Explanation: The claim that the most likely triggering cause of microcephaly is the DTaP shot is false. The most widely accepted cause of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015-2016 was the Zika virus, which was transmitted by mosquitoes. The Zika virus infection during pregnancy has been linked to microcephaly in newborns. The DTaP vaccine is a different vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, and it is not associated with microcephaly. The Brazilian government's mandate for the DTaP vaccine was unrelated to the Zika virus outbreak.

Answer: 0"
893,"Explanation: The claim that ""Our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening)"" is a simplification and an exaggeration of the current job market situation. While it is true that the unemployment rate has been fluctuating and there are periods where the number of job seekers exceeds the number of job openings, the claim that there are three people looking for every job is not accurate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that as of the latest data, the ratio of job seekers to job openings is not as high as three to one. Therefore, the claim is an overstatement and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
894,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual reduced salaries and health benefits by about $10 million while serving as Dane County executive in Wisconsin. However, there is no specific source or evidence provided to verify this claim. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
895,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats have lost more than 900 state legislators since Barack Obama has been president is false. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of 2021, Democrats have lost a total of 30 state legislative seats since 2009, which is the year Barack Obama took office. This number is significantly less than 900.

Answer: 0"
896,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton's ""baby bond"" proposal, as outlined in her 2019 book ""What Happened,"" is a plan to provide a $5,000 trust fund for every child born in the United States. The claim incorrectly states that this would total $20 billion per year and then multiplies it by four years to reach $80 billion. The correct calculation would be $5,000 per child per year, which would indeed total $20 billion per year for 4 million births. However, the claim incorrectly multiplies this annual total by four years, which is not part of the proposal.

Answer: 0"
897,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island would be the first state in the nation to implement a hybrid retirement plan is not accurate. Hybrid retirement plans, which combine elements of defined benefit and defined contribution plans, have been implemented in various states and organizations across the United States. For example, the state of California has implemented a hybrid retirement plan for its employees. Therefore, the claim that Rhode Island would be the first state to do this is false.

Answer: 0"
898,"Explanation: The claim that the State Department reduced security in Libya before the Benghazi attacks is a matter of ongoing debate and has been the subject of multiple investigations and reports. The Accountability Review Board (ARB) report on the Benghazi attacks found that the State Department had requested additional security for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, but the requests were not always granted in a timely manner. However, the report also noted that the security situation in Libya was complex and that the U.S. government was working to improve security measures. The claim that security was actually reduced is not supported by the ARB report or other credible sources.

Answer: 0"
899,"Explanation: The claim is false. Failure to raise the debt limit does not directly force a U.S. default on debt payments. However, it can lead to a default if the government is unable to pay its bills, including interest on its debt. This is because the debt limit is the legal limit on how much debt the U.S. government can accumulate. If the debt limit is not raised, the government may not have enough money to pay its bills, including interest on its debt, which could lead to a default.

Answer: 0"
900,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats in the Legislature in 2009 voted for various pork projects including a $5 million scoreboard for the Milwaukee Bucks is false. The Milwaukee Bucks' new arena, which includes a $5 million scoreboard, was approved in 2019, not in 2009. The arena project was part of a broader agreement that included public funding, but the specific details of the scoreboard's funding were not part of the 2009 legislative session.

Answer: 0"
901,"Explanation: Turkey is not an Arab country. It is a country in Western Asia and Southeastern Europe, with a majority of its population being of Turkish ethnicity. While it has historical and cultural ties to the Arab world, it is not considered an Arab country. The term ""Arab"" typically refers to people who speak Arabic and share a common cultural heritage, and Turkey does not fit this definition.

Answer: 0"
902,"Explanation: The claim states that the number of people in Atlanta dying from HIV and AIDS declined by 59 percent between 2004 and 2012. This claim can be verified by checking reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or local health department reports. According to the CDC, the number of HIV/AIDS deaths in Atlanta has indeed decreased significantly over this period, with a notable decline in the number of new infections and AIDS-related deaths.

Answer: 1"
903,"Explanation: The claim that 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total number of jobs lost during the Great Recession, which occurred during Obama's first term, was approximately 8.8 million. The number of jobs lost by women was around 2.3 million, which is about 26% of the total jobs lost. Therefore, the claim that 92% of the jobs lost belonged to women is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
904,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican Party has not historically advocated for the elimination of the Department of Education. In fact, the Department of Education was established under the administration of Republican President Richard Nixon in 1979. The claim that the Department of Education was doubled in size under Republican leadership is also incorrect. The size of the Department of Education has fluctuated over time, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it was doubled under any specific administration.

Answer: 0"
905,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific situation involving inmates and their living conditions. However, without specific sources or context, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim. It could be a genuine issue in a particular prison, but it could also be a misrepresentation or exaggeration. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
906,"Explanation: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has indeed called for an immediate federal monitor for the Newark Police Department. This was done in response to concerns about the department's use of force and racial profiling. The ACLU's call for a federal monitor was made in a letter to the Department of Justice in 2018, and the request was granted. Therefore, the claim that the ACLU did not call for an investigation but instead called for an immediate federal monitor is true.

Answer: 1"
907,"Explanation: The claim that a highway was closed in El Paso due to bullets flying across the border is false. There have been no reports or credible sources confirming that bullets were fired across the border in El Paso, nor was there any official closure of a highway due to this alleged event.

Answer: 0"
908,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific scenario where the House of Representatives fails to extend the middle-class tax cuts. However, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to support the number of families (400,000) that would be affected. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
909,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific condition that Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate in eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races. This claim is not verifiable with the information provided, as it requires specific data on the Hispanic population in each of these states. Without access to this data, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
910,"Explanation: The claim about Nikita Khrushchev bringing an extra shoe to a United Nations session in 1960 and banging it on the desk in protest is a well-known anecdote. However, it is often misattributed to Khrushchev. The actual event occurred during a speech by Soviet leader Nikolai Bulganin in 1960, where he banged his shoe on the desk in protest. The story has been popularized and often incorrectly attributed to Khrushchev.

Answer: 0"
911,"Explanation: Jim Renacci, a former U.S. Representative from Ohio, did not vote repeatedly to end Medicare. He was a member of the Republican Party and was known for his conservative views, but there is no evidence to suggest that he voted multiple times to end Medicare. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of his political stance.

Answer: 0"
912,"Explanation: The claim states that the special session will cost the state $27,300 a day just for legislators' daily living expenses. However, this claim does not provide any source or context to verify the information. Without specific details or official documentation, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
913,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come to the United States is false. During his presidency, Obama implemented several policies to strengthen border security and immigration vetting processes. For instance, he expanded the use of biometric technology, increased the number of border patrol agents, and implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provided temporary relief from deportation for certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Additionally, he supported comprehensive immigration reform that included measures to improve border security and streamline the immigration process.

Answer: 0"
914,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, Oregon does not have a state capital gains tax. The state does not impose a tax on capital gains, which is different from many other states that do. Therefore, the claim that Oregon is near the top or at the top of the list when it comes to capital gains tax is false.

Answer: 0"
915,"Explanation: The claim that the No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work is a simplification of a complex issue. While job creation and economic recovery are indeed significant concerns for many Americans, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not accurate to say that this is the only or the most pressing issue for all Americans. Other important issues include healthcare, education, racial justice, climate change, and political polarization, among others. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
916,"Explanation: The claim that in 1944 we were in debt more than twice as much as we are now is false. In 1944, the U.S. national debt was approximately $280 billion, which was about 120% of the GDP. In 2021, the U.S. national debt was around $28 trillion, which was about 120% of the GDP. Therefore, the debt in 1944 was not more than twice as much as it is now.

Answer: 0"
917,"Explanation: The claim is about economic indicators and forecasts from private forecasters. Economic indicators are typically released by government agencies or reputable financial institutions, not private forecasters. The claim also suggests that almost all forecasters are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and positive growth in the fourth quarter, which is a broad generalization and not specific enough to be verified.

Answer: 0"
918,"Explanation: The claim about the I-X Center in Ohio is true. The I-X Center was indeed a manufacturing plant that employed thousands of people. However, due to economic changes and the shift towards outsourcing, many jobs were moved overseas, leading to a significant reduction in the workforce. This information is well-documented in various sources, including local news articles and historical records.

Answer: 1"
919,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no law that charges doctors for drug-induced abortions if women do not return for follow-up care. Abortion laws vary by country and region, but they typically do not include provisions that penalize doctors for lack of follow-up care.

923,"Explanation: The claim about abortion is a complex issue that involves legal, ethical, and medical aspects. The truthfulness of the claim depends on the specific statement being made. For example, if the claim is ""Abortion is illegal in all 50 states,"" this would be false because abortion laws vary by state in the United States. If the claim is ""Abortion is a safe medical procedure,"" this would be true as it is a common and safe procedure when performed by trained medical professionals. Without a specific claim to evaluate, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Answer: N/A (The claim is too vague to evaluate as true or false.)"
924,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of infant deaths following attempted abortions is not accurate. The Guttmacher Institute, a leading research and policy organization, reports that in 2010, there were 1,270 infant deaths due to complications from attempted abortions.

941,"Explanation: The claim that veterans are being treated worse than illegal immigrants is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that veterans often face challenges in accessing healthcare and other services, it is not accurate to say that they are being treated worse than illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants may face different challenges, such as lack of legal status and access to certain services, but this does not necessarily mean they are receiving better treatment than veterans. The claim is misleading and oversimplifies the issues faced by both groups.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health organizations, the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but it is not twice as much as any other nation. For example, in 2019, the U.S. spent approximately $10,966 per capita on healthcare, while countries like Switzerland and Germany spent around $5,000-$6,000 per capita. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

945,"Explanation: The Texas Education Agency (TEA) does not follow up to ensure that undocumented immigrants paying in-state tuition at Texas colleges are applying for permanent residency. The TEA's role is to oversee the state's public education system, including the administration of in-state tuition policies. However, the responsibility for immigration status and residency applications lies with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the individual immigrants themselves. There is no evidence to suggest that the TEA is involved in tracking or verifying the immigration status of students.

These laws do not allow for the waiving of privacy rights, and any such language would be illegal and unenforceable.

950,"Explanation: The claim that we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance annually is not accurate. According to the IRS, the total amount of money collected from taxes in the United States in 2020 was approximately $3.5 trillion. The cost of tax compliance, which includes the cost of tax preparation, tax collection, and tax enforcement, is a fraction of the total tax revenue. The military budget for the United States in 2020 was approximately $722 billion. Therefore, the claim that tax compliance costs are equal to the entire military budget is false.

Answer: 0"
951,"Explanation: The claim that exporters are using a federal loophole to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur to U.S. consumers is false.

The Fur Products Labeling Act of 1950 requires that any fur product be labeled with the species of animal from which it is made. Additionally, the importation of dog fur is prohibited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Therefore, it is not possible for exporters to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur to U.S. consumers.

While the U.S. has seen significant job growth in recent years, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not accurate to say that this is the fastest pace in the country's history. The fastest rate of job growth in the U.S. occurred in the late 1990s, with a peak of 3.2% in 1999. The most recent job growth rates have been around 2-3% per year, which is still strong but not unprecedented.

To verify this claim, we would need to check the budget requests made by the sheriff over the past 10 years.

If the claim is false, then there would be instances where the sheriff asked for budget increases that were higher than the inflation rate.

Answer: 1 (assuming the claim is true based on the information provided)"
968,"Explanation: The claim that Mark Warner votes with President Obama 97% of the time is a misrepresentation of the actual voting record.

Answer: 1"
970,"Explanation: The claim that Ocean Spray is moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania largely because of costs associated with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is false. The RGGI is a cap-and-trade program that requires power plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it does not directly affect the costs of manufacturing facilities like Ocean Spray's. The company has cited other reasons for the move, such as the need for a larger facility to accommodate growth and the desire to be closer to its customers.

Answer: 0"
971,"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not run for the presidency in 2012; he ran in 2012. The year ""2012"" is already mentioned in the claim, so it should be ""in 2012"" instead of ""On running for the presidency in 2012.""

Answer: 0"
975,"Explanation: The claim is false. Congress has placed limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to use military force in the past. For example, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops abroad, and Congress can vote to end the deployment. Additionally, the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed after the 9/11 attacks has been used to justify military action against various groups, including the Islamic State. Therefore, the current debate over authorizing military action against the Islamic State is not the first time Congress has placed limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to use military force.

Answer: 0"
976,"Explanation: The claim is true. Marijuana has been cultivated and processed differently over time, leading to variations in potency and composition.

In 2002, when Barack Obama was a state senator in Illinois, he voted in favor of a bill that would have required medical professionals to provide care to infants born alive. This bill was similar to the federal Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2005.

980,"Explanation: The claim that job growth always lags behind economic growth is not universally true. While it is often the case that job growth may not immediately match economic growth due to various factors such as structural changes in the economy, technological advancements, and shifts in industry, it is not accurate to say that job growth always lags behind economic growth. Economic growth can sometimes lead to job growth, especially in sectors that are expanding or experiencing technological advancements. Therefore, the claim is not universally applicable.

While there was significant opposition to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and immigration reform (amnesty) among some segments of the population, it is not accurate to say that the American people overwhelmingly rejected these policies. The 2014 midterm elections saw a mix of support and opposition to these issues, and the results were not a clear mandate against either policy. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that the American people overwhelmingly rejected these policies.

Answer: 0"
984,"Explanation: The claim is false. The approval ratings of Congress are not directly related to the re-election rates of incumbent lawmakers. Approval ratings reflect the public's opinion of Congress as a whole, while re-election rates are a measure of individual lawmakers' success in their campaigns. The approval ratings of Congress can be low due to various reasons, such as public dissatisfaction with specific policies or events, but this does not necessarily impact the re-election rates of individual members.

While VA doctors are not prohibited from discussing medical marijuana with veterans, they are not allowed to recommend or prescribe it. The VA's policy states that veterans should not use medical marijuana, and VA doctors are not authorized to recommend it. Therefore, the claim that VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana is true.

996,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), does not provide Mexican citizens with stronger claims to Social Security benefits or protection against cuts compared to U.S. citizens. The agreement primarily focuses on trade and economic issues, not social security benefits. Mexican citizens would still be subject to the same rules and regulations regarding Social Security benefits as they are now, and there is no indication that they would have stronger claims or protection against cuts.

Answer: 0"
997,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in Florida refused to carry out the effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls"" is false.
