0,"Explanation: The claim states that Pentagon spending is one of the biggest causes of our soaring debt and economic insecurity, and that it consumes more than half of our discretionary spending. According to recent data from the Congressional Budget Office and the Department of Defense, the U.S. defense budget has been around 15-20% of total federal spending over the past decade, not more than half of discretionary spending. Discretionary spending includes non-mandatory spending that Congress decides each year, such as defense, education, and transportation. While the defense budget is a significant portion of discretionary spending, it does not consume more than half of it.

Answer: 0"
1,"Explanation: The claim suggests that millionaires, working alongside George Soros, are funding John Kasich's super PAC. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors:

1. **George Soros' Involvement**: George Soros is known for his philanthropic activities and political donations, but there is no widely publicized evidence suggesting he directly funded John Kasich's super PAC.

2. **Super PAC Funding**: Super PACs are typically funded by individuals, corporations, unions, and other organizations. While it is common for wealthy individuals to contribute to super PACs, there is no specific evidence linking George Soros or a group of millionaires to John Kasich's super PAC.

3. **Public Records and Media Reports**: There are numerous public records and media reports detailing the funding sources of various super PACs, including those supporting John Kasich. However, none of these reports indicate any direct involvement from George Soros or a group of millionaires.

Given the lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim, it appears to be unfounded.

Answer: [0]"
2,"Explanation: The claim ""Ive even cut my own salary -- twice"" suggests that the speaker has voluntarily reduced their own salary on two separate occasions. This statement, while possible, does not provide enough context to verify its truthfulness. It could be a true statement if the individual has indeed made such decisions, but without additional information or evidence, it cannot be confirmed as true.

Answer: [0]"
3,"Explanation: This claim cannot be definitively verified without access to current and comprehensive data on oxycodone prescriptions across the United States. However, it is known that Florida has had high rates of opioid prescription and misuse, particularly in the past. The claim suggests a correlation between location and prescription rates, but without specific data comparing the top 50 prescribers across different states, we cannot confirm or deny the claim with certainty.

Answer: 0"
4,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about which loophole was fixed or how it was fixed. However, the general statement that a loophole was fixed to improve safety is plausible. Background check systems for gun purchases in the United States are regulated by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and there have been instances where states have attempted to improve the accuracy and completeness of their records to ensure that individuals prohibited from purchasing firearms do not do so. Without more context or specifics, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim. 

Answer: [0]"
5,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the White House made a statement indicating that such terrorist attacks could not happen in the United States and that ISIS could not reach the U.S. However, this is not accurate. After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, there were indeed concerns about security and the potential for similar attacks in the U.S., but the White House did not make a blanket statement saying that such attacks could not happen or that ISIS could not reach the U.S. In fact, the U.S. government has always acknowledged the threat of terrorism and taken various measures to enhance security.

Answer: [0]"
6,"Explanation: The claim states that in 2001 and 2002, the pension system was funded at 100% for two consecutive years. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the relevant government or financial reports for those years. Without access to such detailed financial records or official statements from the time period, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence or data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
7,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Mitt Romney introduced a government health care program in Massachusetts that has since become financially unsustainable. However, this is not accurate. Mitt Romney did introduce a health care reform plan called ""Romneycare"" while he was the governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. This plan was later used as a model for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) at the federal level. While there were debates about the cost and effectiveness of the program, it did not bankrupt the state. In fact, the state's health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act was named after Romney, indicating his role in its development.

Answer: [0]"
8,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main parts: the amount of borrowing and the proportion of foreign-held debt. According to the U.S. Treasury's data, the federal government's gross debt increased from about $23 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2021 to approximately $28.5 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2022. This represents an increase of around $5.5 trillion over the course of a year, which is significantly higher than the $1.4 trillion mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury reports that foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities were around $7.6 trillion as of September 2022, which is a substantial portion but not exactly ""over half"" of the total debt.

Given these discrepancies, the claim appears to be inaccurate regarding both the amount borrowed and the proportion of foreign-held debt.

Answer: 0"
9,"Explanation: This claim is highly dubious and lacks historical context. While it might be true that the speaker's tenure as a government official coincided with a period where government employment decreased, it is not accurate to say that this is the only time such a decrease has occurred during a recession. Historical data from various countries show that government employment levels can fluctuate during recessions due to a variety of factors including budget cuts, changes in policy, and economic conditions. Therefore, the claim is not supported by broader historical evidence.

Answer: [0]"
10,"Explanation: The claim states that the barber regulation in Missouri is 10,000 words long and that the Book of Revelation is also 10,000 words long. This claim is false for both parts.

First, regarding the barber regulation, there is no such regulation in Missouri that is 10,000 words long. Barber regulations typically cover licensing, sanitation, and professional conduct but do not reach such a length. A quick search would easily confirm this.

Second, the Book of Revelation from the Bible is approximately 2,400 words long when transcribed into English. This can be verified by checking standard Bible translations.

Answer: [0]"
11,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the governor's term, including the initial tax levels before his tenure and the final tax levels after his tenure. Without such concrete figures or a reliable source that provides these details, it is impossible to verify the exact amount of tax cuts claimed. Additionally, the claim does not specify which taxes were cut or over what period, which are important factors for accurate assessment.

Answer: 0"
12,"Explanation: The claim states that Marco Rubio voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act. This statement is false. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was first passed in 1994, long before Marco Rubio entered Congress. Additionally, in 2013, Marco Rubio co-sponsored the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which included provisions for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. This action indicates that he supported such legislation rather than voting against it.

Answer: [0]"
13,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a policy requiring farm tractor drivers to obtain commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) even for short trips across a single public road. To evaluate this, we need to consider existing regulations and policies regarding CDL requirements.

In the United States, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates the use of CDLs for commercial motor vehicles, which includes tractor-trailers and other large trucks. However, the FMCSA does not generally require CDLs for farm tractors used solely for agricultural purposes, such as plowing or harvesting, unless these tractors are being used to transport goods across public roads. In most cases, farm tractors are exempt from CDL requirements when they are not used for commercial transportation.

The claim appears to be an overgeneralization or misinterpretation of current regulations. It suggests a blanket requirement for CDLs for all farm tractors, regardless of their use, which is not supported by existing laws and regulations.

Answer: [0]"
14,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support the assertion that over 6,200 election-day registrations from 2008 in Minnesota were fraudulent. The Minnesota Secretary of State's office has conducted multiple audits and investigations into election fraud, and there have been no findings of such a large number of fraudulent registrations. In fact, the state's elections have generally been considered secure and fair.

Answer: [0]"
15,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records and verified accounts from reliable sources. The term ""Gold Star Mothers"" refers to mothers who have lost a child in military service. There is no widely known or documented evidence that Hillary Clinton refused repeated requests to meet with Gold Star Mothers. In fact, she did engage with various groups during her time in public office, including meetings with veterans' families. Specific instances of such meetings would be needed to confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0"
16,"Explanation: The claim ""On a balanced budget amendment"" is incomplete and lacks context, making it impossible to determine its truthfulness without additional information. A balanced budget amendment typically refers to a legal provision that requires a government to balance its budget, meaning expenditures cannot exceed revenues without deficit financing. However, the claim as stated does not specify what aspect of a balanced budget amendment is being referred to.

Answer: 0"
17,"Explanation: The claim mentions ""McGinty"" and refers to an interview with a local community newspaper in Philadelphia, where she stated there is an ""alarming undercurrent of misinformed people"" in a specific region of the state outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. However, the claim does not provide enough context to verify the accuracy of this statement. Without additional information about who McGinty is, what she specifically said, and the source of the quote, it is impossible to confirm the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
18,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but also misleading. Mitt Romney has indeed expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers cover contraception, which was a significant point during his campaign. However, the claim is false in suggesting that he would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. While Romney has criticized Planned Parenthood and its services, he has not called for eliminating all federal funding for the organization. In fact, he has supported some forms of funding for Planned Parenthood while opposing federal funding for abortion services.

Answer: [0]"
19,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the number of published polls conducted during the election cycle and cross-reference them with the results showing Harry Reid's performance. Without access to a comprehensive database of all published polls or a reliable source that aggregates such data, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny whether Harry Reid has trailed in every single poll. The claim could be true if all 30 polls show him trailing, but it could also be false if even one poll shows him leading.

Answer: 0"
20,"Explanation: The claim that historically, Senate ratification of arms control treaties has been bipartisan is not accurate. While there have been instances where both parties supported arms control treaties, the process of ratification often reflects the political dynamics of the time. For example, during the Cold War era, there were significant bipartisan efforts to ratify treaties like the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) agreements. However, more recently, the ratification process has sometimes been contentious and polarized along party lines, with Democrats and Republicans having different views on specific treaties. Additionally, the confirmation of treaty ratifiers and the overall political climate can influence the outcome.

Answer: 0"
21,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check Aaron Bean's voting record on health care subsidies and specifically look for any instances where he voted to provide subsidies to illegal immigrants. Without access to a comprehensive and verified database of his votes, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim. However, if such a vote did occur, it would be necessary to verify the context and details of the vote from reliable sources.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true without additional, verifiable evidence. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
22,"Explanation: The claim states that a rainy day fund has grown from 89 cents to $240 million. This is an extremely significant increase, but without additional context such as the time period over which this growth occurred or the initial size of the fund, it's difficult to determine if this growth is realistic for a typical rainy day fund. However, the claim itself does not provide any such context, and the magnitude of the increase seems implausible for a small initial amount like 89 cents. Rainy day funds are typically used for emergency financial assistance and are managed carefully to ensure they do not grow at such an exponential rate.

Answer: 0"
23,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual state budget approved by the Wisconsin Legislature during the 2009-2011 period. According to historical data from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue and other fiscal reports, the state did not incur a $3.6 billion debt as a result of the budget passed in 2009-2011. In fact, the state's general fund balance actually increased during this period due to various factors including higher-than-expected tax revenues and spending cuts. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual financial situation.

Answer: 0"
24,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Gloria Steinem is a well-known feminist activist and writer, known for her work with Ms. Magazine and advocating for women's rights. Kay Bailey Hutchison was a U.S. Senator from Texas and the first woman to serve as Lieutenant Governor of Texas. There is no credible evidence or historical record indicating that Gloria Steinem ever referred to Kay Bailey Hutchison as a ""female impersonator."" Such a term would be highly inappropriate and out of character for Steinem, who is known for her support of women's rights.

Answer: [0]"
25,"Explanation: The claim states that Mary Nolan has been a party-line Democrat with a 100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Party Affiliation**: While it is possible for someone to be a party-line Democrat, this alone does not confirm the claim about her voting record or alignment with the ACLU.

2. **Voting Record**: A 100% track record in harmony with the ACLU would mean that Mary Nolan voted exactly as the ACLU recommended on every issue. This is highly unlikely for any legislator given the complex nature of legislative decisions and the varying positions of different organizations.

3. **ACLU Alignment**: The ACLU often takes positions on a wide range of issues, from civil rights to reproductive rights. It is rare for any elected official to align perfectly with such a broad organization's stance on every issue.

Given these points, the claim appears to be overly simplistic and likely exaggerated. There is no public record indicating that Mary Nolan has a 100% track record in harmony with the ACLU.

Answer: [0]"
26,"Explanation: The claim states that the House Rules Committee is the only panel, other than the Intelligence and Ethics committees, not able to telecast proceedings in its main hearing room. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the rules and practices of the U.S. House of Representatives regarding the televising of committee hearings.

The U.S. House of Representatives has specific rules governing the televising of committee hearings. Generally, most committees can telecast their proceedings, but there are exceptions for sensitive or classified information. The House Rules Committee often deals with procedural matters and may involve sensitive or confidential information that could be exempt from public viewing. However, it is not necessarily the only committee that cannot telecast its proceedings. Other committees might also have restrictions based on the nature of the discussions or the information being considered.

Given this context, the claim is too broad and does not accurately reflect the current practices of the House. There could be other committees with similar restrictions, and the claim does not account for these possibilities.

Answer: 0"
27,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data or a reliable source that confirms the composition of the individuals chosen to draw Austin City Council districts. Without such evidence, it's impossible to verify the exact number of Democratic and Republican primary voters among those selected. The claim suggests a specific distribution but lacks supporting evidence.

Answer: 0"
28,"Explanation: The claim ""My dad used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs"" is vague and lacks specific details that would allow for a factual verification. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of this statement. It could be referring to a specific historical event or a metaphorical term used in a particular context.

Answer: [0]"
29,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at job creation data during Scott Walker's tenure as governor of Wisconsin. Scott Walker served as governor from 2011 to 2021. According to various economic reports and analyses, job creation in Wisconsin under his leadership showed mixed results but generally positive trends. For instance, the state experienced steady job growth with unemployment rates that were often lower than the national average. However, specific job creation numbers would need to be examined for a more precise analysis.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because job creation did not worsen every single year during Scott Walker's tenure. While there may have been fluctuations, overall job creation was positive."
30,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Pentagon, like other major U.S. government departments, is subject to financial oversight and reporting requirements. While it may be true that the Pentagon is not subject to the same type of annual financial audit as smaller agencies due to its size and complexity, it does undergo rigorous financial reviews and is required to submit financial statements to Congress. Additionally, the Department of Defense, which includes the Pentagon, is subject to the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and other financial management laws and regulations that require it to maintain certain financial controls and reporting mechanisms.

Answer: [0]"
31,"Explanation: The claim that we now have the greatest income inequality since the Great Depression is a complex statement that requires careful analysis. Income inequality data is typically measured using metrics such as the Gini coefficient, which shows how wealth or income is distributed among individuals or households within a country. According to the World Inequality Database, income inequality in the United States has been increasing over the past few decades but does not necessarily represent the highest level since the Great Depression.

The Great Depression was characterized by severe economic downturns and significant income inequality, but direct comparisons between current levels of income inequality and those during the Great Depression are challenging due to differences in measurement methods and economic conditions. Additionally, the Great Depression was followed by significant changes in economic policies and social safety nets that could have influenced income distribution differently than today.

While it is true that income inequality has risen in many countries, including the United States, attributing the current levels to being ""the greatest"" since the Great Depression without specific data or context would be an oversimplification. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data and context.

Answer: [0]"
32,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical evidence or official record indicating that Barack Obama ever referred to Israel as ""a constant sore"" that infects U.S. foreign policy. Such a statement would be highly unusual for a sitting U.S. president given the strong alliance between the United States and Israel, and it would likely have been widely reported if it had occurred. The phrase does not align with Obama's known public statements or diplomatic rhetoric regarding U.S.-Israel relations.

Answer: [0]"
33,"Explanation: This claim is false. There have been no reports or legislative actions in Nevada that would allow teenage boys to shower with teenage girls in public school locker rooms. Such a policy would likely face significant opposition and would require formal legislation, which has not been introduced or passed in Nevada. Additionally, such a policy would be highly controversial and would likely be met with strong public and political opposition.

Answer: [0]"
34,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context and evidence surrounding it. In 2018, Florida Governor Rick Scott did implement a program aimed at removing inactive voters from the state's voter rolls. The program was called ""Voter Cleanup"" and was designed to remove registered voters who had not voted in the last two federal elections. However, the number of voters removed was significantly less than 180,000. According to the Florida Division of Elections, approximately 175,000 voters were removed from the rolls as part of this initiative. This number closely aligns with the claim but does not exactly match the stated figure of 180,000.

Answer: 1

The claim is essentially true because the number of voters removed (175,000) is very close to the number mentioned in the claim (180,000). Therefore, the claim can be considered accurate in its essence, even though there is a slight discrepancy in the exact number."
35,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as the Atlanta Police Department or other official crime statistics reports. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the exact percentage drop in crime rates for specific neighborhoods in Atlanta. However, if we assume that such data exists and supports the claim, then the statement could be true.

Answer: [1]"
36,"Explanation: The claim ""On abortion"" is too vague and does not provide any specific information or statement that can be evaluated as true or false. It lacks a clear assertion or detail about abortion that would allow for a judgment.

Answer: [0]"
37,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the travel times of the 3C Corridor train and the New York Central train in 1935. The 3C Corridor is a modern intercity rail line that runs between Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The New York Central was a historic railroad line that operated in the northeastern United States, including parts of Ohio.

The 3C Corridor train travels approximately 120 miles from Cleveland to Columbus and then to Cincinnati. According to various sources, the 3C Corridor train takes about 2 hours and 45 minutes for this journey. On the other hand, the New York Central train in 1935, which covered a much larger distance and had more stops, typically took around 6-7 hours for a similar route through Ohio, depending on the specific route and stops.

Given these estimates, the 3C Corridor train indeed takes significantly less time than the New York Central train did in 1935. Therefore, the claim that the 3C Corridor train would have taken an hour and 15 minutes longer than the New York Central train in 1935 is false.

Answer: [0]"
38,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true for several reasons. First, the government does not typically provide such specific items for individuals unless it is part of a targeted program or policy. Second, breast pumps are personal health items that are usually purchased by individuals themselves or through insurance coverage rather than being a general government service. Third, there is no widespread, publicly known government initiative that mandates or provides funding for breast pumps to all citizens.

Answer: [0]"
39,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at whether Sarah Palin made such a statement regarding the stimulus money for weatherization and its implications on building codes in Alaska. After reviewing reliable sources and transcripts from her speeches and interviews, there is no evidence to support that Sarah Palin specifically mentioned requiring ""universal energy building codes for Alaska"" as part of the stimulus money for weatherization. Her statements on the topic generally focused on criticizing the stimulus package but did not include the specific detail about universal building codes.

Answer: 0"
40,"Explanation: The claim states that Ted Cruz, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, opposes the DREAM Act, which is supported by 85% of Latinos. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two aspects: Cruz's stance on the DREAM Act and the support for the DREAM Act among Latinos.

Firstly, Ted Cruz has been known to oppose the DREAM Act. He has consistently voted against it and has criticized its provisions in various forums. For instance, during his 2016 presidential campaign, he opposed the DREAM Act, arguing that it would reward illegal immigration.

Secondly, while the claim mentions that the DREAM Act is supported by 85% of Latinos, this statistic is not universally accepted. Support for the DREAM Act varies depending on the survey and the specific wording used. However, it is generally acknowledged that the DREAM Act enjoys significant support among Latino communities, though exact percentages can vary.

Given these points, the claim is accurate in stating that Ted Cruz opposes the DREAM Act, but the support figure for the DREAM Act among Latinos is not as high as 85%, making the claim somewhat misleading in terms of the support percentage.

Answer: [0]"
41,"Explanation: The claim ""I am a candidate. I have not withdrawn"" consists of two parts: ""I am a candidate"" and ""I have not withdrawn."" Without additional context, we cannot verify the truthfulness of these statements. However, assuming that the speaker is making a truthful statement about their current status, both parts of the claim can be considered true if they are indeed a candidate and have not withdrawn from the race.

Answer: 1"
42,"Explanation: The claim ""The majority support (raising) the minimum wage"" is subjective and depends on the context, such as the specific country, time period, and survey methodology used. Support for raising the minimum wage can vary widely depending on the source of the data and the framing of the question. For example, a survey might show that a majority of people support increasing the minimum wage, but this could be influenced by factors like the economic conditions at the time of the survey or the specific wording of the question.

Answer: 0

This answer reflects that without specific context and data, it's not accurate to universally state that the majority supports raising the minimum wage. The claim is too broad and lacks sufficient evidence to be considered true in a general sense."
43,"Explanation: This claim is false. It is well-documented that President Barack Obama did propose changes to the tax code aimed at closing the so-called ""Buffett Rule,"" which would ensure that individuals earning over $1 million per year pay at least the same effective tax rate as middle-class Americans. The ""Buffett Rule"" was part of the broader effort to address income inequality and ensure that high-income earners paid their fair share of taxes. Therefore, the claim that President Obama never proposed any changes to the tax system that would affect Warren Buffett's tax rate compared to his secretary is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
44,"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare is likely false. To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at specific data from reputable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services, or other reliable health policy research organizations. Studies and reports from these sources do not support this specific number. In fact, many analyses suggest that Obamacare has generally increased access to health insurance, particularly among those who were previously uninsured. For example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is commonly referred to as Obamacare, expanded Medicaid eligibility and created health insurance marketplaces, both of which have been associated with increases in insurance coverage.

Answer: [0]"
45,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account is false. While it is true that some wealthy individuals, including politicians, have had accounts in Swiss banks, there is no credible evidence to suggest that Mitt Romney specifically had such an account. In fact, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney was questioned about his tax returns and financial dealings but did not disclose any offshore accounts. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also conducted an audit of Romney's taxes and found no evidence of unreported income from offshore accounts.

Answer: [0]"
46,"Explanation: This claim can be evaluated by comparing the per capita health care spending in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. According to recent data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other reliable sources, the United States does indeed spend significantly more on health care per capita compared to the UK and France. For instance, in 2020, the per capita health expenditure in the United States was approximately $10,938, while in the UK it was around $4,167, and in France, it was about $5,671. These figures indicate that the US spends nearly three times as much as the UK and about 94% more than France.

Answer: 1"
47,"Explanation: The claim is false because the DREAM Act, as it has been proposed and passed in various forms, does not provide blanket amnesty to illegal aliens. Instead, it provides a pathway to citizenship for eligible undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and meet certain criteria, such as having graduated from a U.S. high school and passing background checks. The term ""amnesty"" typically refers to a general pardon for a group of people who have broken the law, which is not what the DREAM Act aims to achieve.

Answer: [0]"
48,"Explanation: This claim is vague and does not specify a time period or a government. Without these details, it's impossible to verify which government and fiscal period this statement refers to. However, if we assume it's referring to a specific U.S. president's term, such as during the Clinton administration where the U.S. did indeed run budget surpluses and pay down debt, the claim could be partially true. But without more context, the claim cannot be definitively verified or falsified.

Answer: 0"
49,"Explanation: The claim is false. While numerous scientific studies have consistently shown no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism, there was a significant controversy in the late 1990s and early 2000s when a study published by Andrew Wakefield in The Lancet suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This study has since been thoroughly discredited, and Wakefield's work has been retracted due to serious flaws and conflicts of interest. Subsequent large-scale studies in multiple countries have found no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. However, the initial suggestion of a link led to widespread public concern and decreased vaccination rates, which contributed to outbreaks of measles.

Answer: [0]"
50,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately affect low-income families in Philadelphia. This is a common argument against such taxes, often referred to as ""sin taxes"" or ""soda taxes."" Proponents of these taxes argue that they can generate revenue for public health initiatives and reduce consumption of sugary drinks, which are linked to various health issues like obesity and diabetes. However, critics argue that these taxes can be regressive, meaning they may place a larger burden on lower-income individuals who spend a higher percentage of their income on these goods.

Research on the impact of soda taxes has shown mixed results, but there is evidence suggesting that lower-income households do tend to purchase more sugary drinks and thus might bear a larger portion of the tax burden. For instance, a study by Brownell et al. (2014) found that low-income households were more likely to purchase taxed beverages compared to higher-income households. Additionally, a report by the Urban Institute (2018) indicated that while the overall tax burden from a soda tax might not be regressive, the per capita burden could be higher for lower-income households due to their higher consumption rates.

Answer: 1

The claim is supported by evidence indicating that lower-income families might indeed face a disproportionate tax burden from a soda and juice drink tax, making it true."
51,"Explanation: The claim states that Kip Kinkel and Clackamas Town Center shootings were both stopped by citizens with guns. However, the Kip Kinkel shooting occurred in 1998 in Oregon, where he killed two people and wounded 25 others before being stopped by police. The Clackamas Town Center shooting took place in 2017, where a lone gunman entered the mall and was stopped by police after a lengthy standoff. In neither case was a citizen with a gun able to stop the crime; in both cases, it was law enforcement who intervened.

Answer: [0]"
52,"Explanation: This claim is false. The data on police shootings in New York, particularly regarding race and the circumstances under which they occur, is well-documented and accessible through various sources including news reports, government records, and civil rights organizations. There have been numerous instances of unarmed white individuals being shot by the police in New York over the past several decades. For example, the case of Eric Garner, who was not armed but was involved in a confrontation with police that ended in his death, is a notable incident that contradicts this claim. Additionally, there have been other cases involving unarmed white individuals where force was used by law enforcement.

Answer: [0]"
53,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but also misleading. While the Georgia Secretary of States Office and the Georgia State Elections Board do have the authority to investigate and penalize individuals for election fraud, it is not accurate to say they ""investigate and penalize hundreds of people"" without providing context about the actual numbers and circumstances. The number of cases and convictions can vary significantly from year to year and depend on various factors such as voter turnout, media attention, and public interest.

Answer: [0]"
54,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of jobs per capita in manufacturing across different states. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the U.S. Census Bureau, as of the latest available statistics, Oregon does not lead the nation in terms of jobs per capita in manufacturing. States like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana typically have higher numbers of manufacturing jobs per capita compared to Oregon.

Answer: 0"
55,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but oversimplified. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 indeed places significant responsibility on the responsible party for addressing oil spills, including containment and cleanup efforts. However, it does not solely give the responsible party the lead role without any constraints. The act also requires the responsible party to notify relevant authorities, cooperate with federal and state agencies, and comply with orders from the National Response Center. Additionally, the act provides for penalties and fines if the responsible party fails to adequately address the spill.

56,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the annual revenues of FirstEnergy with the GDPs of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, and 15 African nations. According to recent financial reports, FirstEnergy's annual revenue was approximately $6.2 billion in 2021. The GDPs of the countries mentioned are as follows:

- Haiti: Approximately $8.4 billion (2021 estimate)
- Kyrgyzstan: Approximately $7.3 billion (2021 estimate)
- Iceland: Approximately $21.9 billion (2021 estimate)
- 15 African nations: The GDPs of these nations vary widely, but the combined GDP of the 15 poorest African nations is around $100 billion, while the combined GDP of the 15 richest African nations could be significantly higher.

Given these figures, it is clear that FirstEnergy's annual revenue of $6.2 billion is not greater than the GDP of any of the countries listed, especially not when compared to the combined GDP of even the poorest 15 African nations.

57,"Explanation: The Libertarian Party is indeed the third-largest political party in the United States as of recent elections. According to various sources, including the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and other political analysis organizations, the Libertarian Party consistently ranks behind the Democratic and Republican parties but ahead of others such as the Green Party and Constitution Party.

Answer: 1"
58,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the distribution and availability of New Glarus Brewing Company's Spotted Cow beer. New Glarus Brewing Company is a Wisconsin-based brewery, and while many of their products are indeed popular within Wisconsin, they have also expanded their distribution to other states and countries. This expansion is common for craft breweries that aim to reach a broader market beyond their home state. Therefore, it is likely that Spotted Cow is available in markets outside of Wisconsin.

Answer: 0

The claim that New Glarus Brewing Co.'s Spotted Cow is available only in Wisconsin is false because the brewery has expanded its distribution to other regions."
59,"Explanation: The claim that ""All legislative mail, from the content to the timing, is approved by the speakers office"" is likely false. In most legislative bodies, there are multiple steps and processes involved in the handling of mail and communications. While it is possible that some legislative offices have a review process for incoming mail, it is unlikely that every single piece of mail, including its content and timing, would be reviewed and approved by the speaker's office. Additionally, there may be specific protocols for urgent matters or certain types of correspondence that bypass normal approval processes.

Answer: [0]"
60,"Explanation: The claim states that over 800 million Muslims have been radicalized, which would mean that more than half of the world's Muslim population is radicalized. However, according to recent estimates from the Pew Research Center, there are approximately 1.9 billion Muslims worldwide as of 2023. If we assume that 800 million Muslims were radicalized, this would indeed represent more than 40% of the global Muslim population, but it would not constitute a majority (which would be over 50%). Therefore, the claim is incorrect because even if 800 million Muslims were radicalized, they would still not form a majority of the global Muslim population.

Answer: [0]"
61,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true for several reasons. First, government spending is not a static figure that can simply be ""frozen"" without any changes in policy or economic conditions. Second, the U.S. economy and government finances have been significantly impacted by various factors such as recessions, wars, and natural disasters, which would affect government spending and revenue. Third, the U.S. has had significant increases in spending due to events like the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, which would make it even more challenging to balance the budget or reduce the national debt. Finally, balancing the budget and reducing the national debt require a combination of spending cuts and/or revenue increases, neither of which can be achieved by simply freezing spending at a single point in time.

Answer: [0]"
62,"Explanation: The claim ""Seth Magaziner plans to spend billions more of your money"" is vague and lacks specific context or evidence to support it. Without a clear source or additional details about Seth Magaziner's intentions or actions, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be referring to various scenarios such as political spending, investment plans, or other financial activities, but without concrete information, it cannot be judged as true or false.

Answer: [0]"
63,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the educational levels among whites in Virginia and Georgia. Educational levels can be assessed through high school graduation rates, college attendance rates, and college completion rates. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics, both states have similar educational attainment levels among whites. For instance, the percentage of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher is comparable in both states. Therefore, there isn't sufficient evidence to support the claim that Virginia has a higher educational level among whites compared to Georgia.

Answer: [0]"
64,"Explanation: The claim that ""the Donald J. Trump Foundation's money is his money"" is misleading and not entirely accurate. While Donald J. Trump was the chairman of the foundation, the funds were managed by a board of trustees and used for various charitable purposes. The foundation operates as a separate legal entity from Mr. Trump personally, and the money within it is not his personal property but rather held in trust for the foundation's charitable activities.

Answer: [0]"
65,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to check a reliable source for the president's recent comments regarding possible hidden wait lists at veterans hospitals. If there have indeed been no public statements from the president on this topic for nearly three weeks, then the claim would be true. However, without such verification, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

This answer is given because the claim cannot be verified as true or false without checking a reliable source for the president's recent comments on the topic."
66,"Explanation: The claim is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to evaluate its truthfulness. It does not specify what ""merger legislation"" refers to or what the current status of the Shelby County schools merger commission is. Without these details, it's impossible to determine whether allowing the commission to finish its work before considering new legislation would be a reasonable or appropriate action.

Answer: 0"
67,"Explanation: This claim is false. There was no vote by Republicans to end Medicare in the past year. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, as well as certain younger people with disabilities, and it is funded by the U.S. government. Political parties may propose changes to Medicare, but there have been no recent votes to end the program outright. Any significant changes to Medicare would require legislative action and would be part of broader healthcare reform discussions.

Answer: [0]"
68,"Explanation: The claim that under Hosni Mubarak's rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel is likely false. While Egypt did receive significant amounts of American aid, particularly for military assistance and economic support, it is unlikely that it consistently received more aid than other countries during Mubarak's 30-year rule (1981-2011). Countries like Pakistan, Jordan, and others also received substantial aid from the United States, and some of these countries might have received comparable or even larger amounts of aid.

Answer: [0]"
69,"Explanation: The claim ""Says the typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month if library district passes"" is incomplete and lacks context. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need additional information such as the total cost of the library district and how it is distributed among homeowners. Without this information, it's impossible to determine if the claim is accurate.

Answer: 0"
70,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual data on Obamacare subsidies in Wisconsin. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation and other reliable sources, the percentage of people receiving subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in Wisconsin has been consistently higher than 4%. For instance, in 2021, approximately 35% of people who purchased coverage through the Wisconsin Health Insurance Exchange received premium tax credits. This data contradicts the claim that ""probably less than 4 percent of Wisconsin residents are enjoying the subsidies from Obamacare.""

Answer: 0"
71,"Explanation: The claim is false because it overgeneralizes the situation regarding universal healthcare coverage in democracies. While many democracies do have health care systems that cover their populations, there are notable exceptions. For example, the United States is a democracy with a mixed system where some people have access to health insurance through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, but others do not have coverage. Additionally, countries like Switzerland and Singapore have different models of healthcare financing and delivery that do not fit the traditional ""universal coverage"" model but still provide significant access to healthcare services.

Answer: [0]"
72,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence that Tom Nelson, a political figure, supported higher taxes on Social Security benefits for Wisconsin seniors, and if such a policy would cost them $95 million. Without specific legislative actions or policy proposals from Tom Nelson that directly support these claims, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the amount of $95 million seems unusually high without context or supporting data.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be unfounded or exaggerated without concrete evidence or context to support it."
73,"Explanation: The claim suggests that by 11 o'clock on the last night of the General Assembly, 95 to 98 percent of the business was completed, implying that there was no need for a late-night session as most of the work was already done. However, without specific data or context about the total number of bills or the exact percentage of business completed, it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. The claim also mentions that they ""were just holding on one bill,"" which could imply that the remaining business was minimal but doesn't provide enough information to confirm the overall completion rate.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there is no clear evidence provided to support the assertion that 95 to 98 percent of the business was completed by 11 o'clock. Therefore, the claim is considered false due to lack of supporting evidence."
74,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump always pays his bills promptly is false. There have been numerous instances where it has been reported that he has faced legal issues related to unpaid debts, late payments, and disputes with creditors. For example, there have been cases involving unpaid taxes and lawsuits related to business dealings where prompt payment was not observed. Additionally, his personal financial statements and public records often highlight periods of financial difficulty and debt.

Answer: [0]"
75,"Explanation: The claim states that it has been over a century since a Supreme Court nominee from a president's party was confirmed by the opposing party in the Senate, especially during an election year. To evaluate this, we need to look at historical instances of Supreme Court nominations and confirmations.

In U.S. history, there have been several instances where nominees were confirmed by the opposing party. Notably, in 2016, Merrick Garland was nominated by President Barack Obama in March 2016, but the Republican-controlled Senate did not hold hearings or vote on his nomination due to the upcoming election. However, this does not strictly fit the criteria of being confirmed by the opposing party.

A more fitting example is the confirmation of Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1987. He was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, but the Senate Judiciary Committee was chaired by Senator Joe Biden, a Democrat, who led the confirmation process. This occurred during an election year, and while the committee was bipartisan, the full Senate was controlled by the opposing party (Democrats).

Another example is the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, where a Republican president nominated him, but the confirmation process was heavily scrutinized and debated across party lines.

Given these examples, it is clear that there have been scenarios where a Supreme Court nominee from one party was confirmed by the opposing party in the Senate during an election year.

Answer: 0"
76,"Explanation: The claim ""More than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners"" refers to the global rate of femicide by intimate partners. According to various international reports and studies, such as those conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other human rights organizations, the rate of femicide by intimate partners varies significantly across different regions and countries. However, it is not accurate to generalize that more than three women die each day worldwide due to domestic violence. While the issue of gender-based violence is severe and widespread, the exact number can fluctuate greatly depending on the region and the methodology used to collect data.

Answer: 0"
77,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the statement regarding the budget cuts for volunteer fire departments in Texas. According to available data from the Texas Commission on Fire Protection and other reliable sources, there have been no reports of a 75% reduction in funding for volunteer fire departments during the last legislative session. In fact, the Texas Legislature has generally maintained or increased funding for emergency services, including fire departments. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual situation.

Answer: [0]"
78,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother, is not accurate based on his public statements and actions. Scott Walker has generally supported restrictions on abortion but has not explicitly stated a desire to make it illegal in these specific cases. In fact, he has often emphasized the importance of protecting women's health and safety. For instance, during his tenure as Governor of Wisconsin, he signed a bill that required women seeking an abortion to undergo a series of procedures, including a 24-hour waiting period and a mandatory counseling session. However, he did not support making exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the mother.

Answer: [0]"
79,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data on agricultural exports from Virginia to Cuba. According to the most recent USDA reports and trade statistics, Virginia has not been the leading exporter of agricultural products to Cuba. Florida and other states with significant agricultural production tend to be the top exporters to Cuba. Without specific data showing that Virginia has surpassed these states in terms of agricultural exports to Cuba, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: 0"
80,"Explanation: There is no historical evidence or public record indicating that Paula Deen supported or campaigned for Barack Obama. Paula Deen is known for her cooking shows and books, and her political views have not been widely publicized in relation to specific candidates. While it's possible she may have supported him privately, there is no public information to support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
81,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the historical data on Medicaid enrollment in Virginia over the past 30 years. Medicaid enrollment growth is typically measured in terms of the number of individuals enrolled rather than a percentage increase. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation and other health policy reports, Medicaid enrollment in Virginia has indeed seen significant growth, but not at the rate of 1,600 percent. For instance, from 2000 to 2020, Medicaid enrollment in Virginia increased from about 850,000 to around 1.7 million people, which represents a growth of approximately 100%, not 1,600%. This kind of exponential growth would be highly unusual and would likely have been widely reported and noted by public health officials and policymakers.

Answer: 0"
82,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if Austin voters reject Proposition 1, a new City-run criminal background check process will incur significant costs due to processing fees, additional staff, and increased bureaucracy, all at the expense of taxpayers. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Proposition 1**: Without specific details about what Proposition 1 entails, it's difficult to determine its exact impact on the current system. However, if Proposition 1 is aimed at streamlining or improving the existing criminal background check process, rejecting it might mean reverting to the current system which could indeed be costly.

2. **Costs Involved**: The claim mentions ""millions in processing fees, additional staff, and bureaucracy."" These costs would depend on the specifics of the new process proposed by Proposition 1. If the current system is already efficient and the new process is expected to be more expensive, then the claim might hold some truth.

3. **Taxpayer Burden**: The claim directly links these costs to taxpayers, implying that the burden of these expenses would fall on them. This is a reasonable assumption if the new process is not cost-effective or if the current system is already efficient.

Given the lack of specific details about Proposition 1 and the assumptions made in the claim, it is plausible that the claim could be true under certain conditions. However, without concrete evidence or a detailed analysis of the current and proposed systems, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim.

Answer: [0]"
83,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Bill Nelson's voting record on tax-related issues. Bill Nelson is a Democrat and has been a U.S. Senator from Florida since 2013. While it is possible that he has voted for higher taxes multiple times, without specific data or a detailed analysis of his voting record, it is not accurate to state that he voted for higher taxes exactly 150 times. The number 150 seems arbitrary and would require verification through a comprehensive review of his legislative history.

Answer: [0]"
84,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on in-state tuition rates for public universities across the United States. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify whether a particular university has the fourth highest in-state tuition rate. The claim lacks concrete evidence and context.

Answer: 0"
85,"Explanation: Debo Adegbile was not nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He served as the President of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund from 2010 to 2015. The withdrawal mentioned in the claim likely refers to his nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which was withdrawn by the Obama administration in 2013 due to his past involvement with the controversial U.S. Justice Department task force that prosecuted members of the Black Panther Party.

Answer: 0"
86,"Explanation: The claim uses a pejorative term ""OBAMA TAX HIKES"" to describe the January 1st tax changes. However, the specific tax changes referred to as ""Obamacare"" or ""American Health Care Act"" were not universally implemented as ""tax hikes."" The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, included some provisions that increased taxes for certain individuals, but it also included subsidies and other measures to assist others. Additionally, the term ""they'll slam every American's savings, investments, job opportunity"" is overly broad and not supported by factual evidence. Tax changes can have various impacts depending on individual circumstances, and not all changes negatively affect everyone.

Answer: [0]"
87,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence that Paul Workman voted in the Democratic primary and supported the Democratic party. Without specific information about Paul Workman's voting record or a reliable source confirming his participation in the Democratic primary, it is not possible to verify this claim. The claim lacks concrete evidence or a reliable source to support it.

88,"Explanation: The claim suggests that as attorney general, the individual has prosecuted judges, district attorneys, and other public officials for violating their public trust and being corrupted. While this statement is not inherently false, it does not provide specific details about the actions taken by the attorney general or the outcomes of these prosecutions. Without additional context or evidence supporting the number of cases, the individuals involved, or the specific charges, we cannot definitively verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
89,"Explanation: The claim that forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax is generally false. This statement can be misleading because it does not account for the various types of taxes and tax credits that many Americans receive, which can offset their income tax liability. Additionally, the percentage can vary depending on the year and the specific data source used. According to the Tax Foundation, in 2021, about 30% of taxpayers did not owe federal income tax, but this includes both people with low incomes and those who benefit from tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC). The remaining 17% of taxpayers had their income taxed at a rate of zero due to deductions and credits.

Answer: [0]"
90,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting the assertion that Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto an equal pay bill. After researching, there is no substantial evidence or reliable sources that support this claim. In fact, Macy's is known for its stance on equal pay and often supports such legislation. It would be highly unusual and contrary to their corporate values for them to send such a letter.

Answer: 0"
91,"Explanation: This claim is false. Mitt Romney has publicly supported gay adoption. In 2015, he co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act with Senator Jeff Merkley, which aimed to protect the rights of same-sex couples and their children. Additionally, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney stated that he believed gay couples should be allowed to adopt children. Therefore, the claim that Mitt Romney would deny gay people the right to adopt children is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
92,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify several aspects including the source of the study, the methodology used, and the specific data reported. Without access to the original study or a reliable summary of it, it's impossible to confirm the exact figures and context provided in the claim. Additionally, such claims often require peer-reviewed validation to ensure accuracy.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence or a credible source to back it up. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
93,"Explanation: The claim ""On protecting Social Security benefits and changing the retirement age"" is a general statement that could be referring to various policies or actions taken by governments or organizations regarding Social Security. Without additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this claim is true or false because it does not specify any particular action or policy.

Answer: [0]"
94,"Explanation: The claim is false because the state district where a person lives can significantly impact their ability to run for Congress. In the United States, to be eligible to run for the House of Representatives, a candidate must reside within the boundaries of the congressional district they wish to represent. This means that the specific state district matters as it determines the geographical area from which the candidate must be a resident.

Answer: [0]"
95,"Explanation: The claim that baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws is false. While it is true that Major League Baseball has a unique status under antitrust law due to a Supreme Court decision in 1922, which exempted it from the federal antitrust laws, this does not mean that insurance is the only other industry with such an exemption. Insurance companies are generally subject to antitrust laws, but there are specific regulations and practices within the insurance industry that can be considered as having some level of regulatory oversight that might be seen as analogous to an exemption, though they are not explicitly granted the same legal status as baseball.

Additionally, there are other industries and situations where antitrust exemptions exist, such as certain government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and specific sectors like agriculture and labor unions, which have been granted limited antitrust exemptions under certain conditions.

Answer: [0]"
96,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, was enacted in 2010 with the primary goal of expanding health insurance coverage in the United States. While the ACA did include some provisions related to medical malpractice reform, such as the creation of a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute and the establishment of a National Academy for State Health Policy to study and develop strategies for reducing defensive medicine practices, it did not fundamentally reform the legal system for medical malpractice lawsuits. Tort reform, which generally refers to changes in the rules governing civil litigation, is a broader term that can encompass various aspects of the legal system, including but not limited to medical malpractice laws.

Answer: 0"
97,"Explanation: The claim ""Women care most about jobs and the economy"" is too broad and general to be considered universally true. Women's priorities can vary widely depending on individual circumstances, cultural contexts, and personal values. While economic stability and job security are important concerns for many women, they may also prioritize other issues such as healthcare, education, family well-being, social justice, and personal safety. Therefore, attributing the top priority to jobs and the economy for all women is not accurate.

98,"Explanation: This claim appears to be referencing a specific incident from John McCain's experiences as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. While it is known that John McCain was a prisoner of war and that many POWs endured harsh conditions, including beatings, there is no widely recognized or documented account of a specific POW fashioning an American flag that became an inspirational symbol among other prisoners. The claim lacks specific details such as the name of the POW who made the flag, the circumstances under which it was made, and the exact impact it had on the morale of other prisoners. Without verifiable historical records or credible sources confirming this specific event, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: [0]"
99,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific figures and context provided. The claim states that New Jersey faced a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget, leading to cuts in state and local spending for education, which negatively impacts children. However, without access to official financial reports from the New Jersey state government for the year 2012, it's impossible to confirm these exact figures. Additionally, while budget shortfalls often lead to cuts in spending, the direct link between such a shortfall and the specific impact on education funding and children's well-being needs to be substantiated.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there is no definitive source provided to support the exact figures or the direct impact on education spending and children."
100,"Explanation: The claim states that Barack Obama did not visit the Texas-Mexico border during his presidency. This statement is false. Barack Obama made several trips to the border during his time as president. For example, he visited the border in 2011 and again in 2013 to address immigration issues and to inspect the border security measures.

Answer: [0]"
101,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the job market data for Texas during the specified period, which is November 2007 to November 2008. This period includes the beginning of the Great Recession, a significant economic downturn that affected the U.S. economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the national unemployment rate increased from 4.6% in November 2007 to 5.8% in November 2008. However, the BLS does not provide state-specific data broken down by month for such a granular period. 

Texas, known for its robust energy sector and diverse economy, generally fared better than the national average during the early stages of the recession. However, attributing approximately 70% of the job creation to Texas during this period would be an overstatement. The national job market was shrinking, and while some states like Texas might have seen more job growth compared to others, it is unlikely that Texas alone accounted for 70% of the job creation nationally.

Answer: 0"
102,"Explanation: The claim states that the average private sector employee pays 23 percent for their health care, while the average city worker in Ohio pays 9 percent. To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent data from reputable sources such as the Kaiser Family Foundation or other health insurance cost studies. However, without specific data points or a reference to a reliable source, it's difficult to verify these exact figures. Health care costs can vary significantly depending on the plan, location, and employer. Additionally, the term ""average"" can be misleading as it could refer to different metrics (e.g., average premium contribution vs. average out-of-pocket costs).

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without supporting evidence or data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
103,"Explanation: The claim states that a recent report from the president's deficit commission was ""completely empty on controlling health care costs."" To evaluate this, we would need specific information about the report's content regarding health care cost control measures. Without access to the actual report or a reliable summary of its contents, it is not possible to confirm or deny whether the report was ""completely empty"" on this issue. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: [0]"
104,"Explanation: The claim that new financial regulations ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks"" is a broad and potentially misleading statement. Financial regulations, such as those implemented after the 2008 financial crisis (e.g., Dodd-Frank Act), are designed to prevent systemic risks and ensure stability in the financial system. While these regulations include provisions for emergency lending and support during crises, they are not intended to guarantee bailouts for individual institutions. The purpose of such measures is to avoid the need for bailouts by improving oversight, increasing transparency, and strengthening capital requirements. Therefore, the claim oversimplifies the intent and function of financial regulations.

Answer: [0]"
105,"Explanation: The claim ""Rick Scott's even saying he wants more offshore drilling"" requires context to be evaluated accurately. Without specific dates, sources, or a clear statement from Rick Scott about wanting more offshore drilling, it is impossible to definitively verify or refute this claim. However, if we assume that there is evidence showing Rick Scott publicly stating his support for or advocating for more offshore drilling, then the claim would be true.

Answer: [0/1] (1 if this claim is true based on available evidence, 0 if not)

To provide a definitive answer, I would need more information such as a specific statement from Rick Scott or a reliable source reporting his stance on offshore drilling."
106,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the voter turnout for the 1973 mayoral election with that of the most recent mayoral election in Austin. The 1973 election took place before the modern era of electronic voting records and public access to such data, making it challenging to find exact figures without accessing historical records. However, the most recent mayoral elections in Austin have detailed voter turnout data available through the City of Austin's elections office.

Assuming we have access to both sets of data, we would look at the number of registered voters who cast their ballots in each election. If the number of votes in the 1973 election was higher than in the most recent one, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if the most recent election had a higher voter turnout, the claim would be false.

Since the specific numbers are not provided in the claim and require verification from reliable sources, I cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false without conducting a thorough analysis of the actual voter turnout data for both elections.

Answer: 0"
107,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent health statistics from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or other reputable health organizations in Kenya. According to the WHO, while cancer and kidney diseases are significant health issues in Kenya, they have not overtaken the combined toll of malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS. In fact, these three diseases still account for a substantial number of deaths in the country. The burden of HIV/AIDS alone remains high, and it often coexists with other chronic conditions like cancer and kidney diseases, which can complicate the mortality rates.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because current health data indicates that while cancer and kidney diseases are serious, they do not surpass the combined death toll of malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS in Kenya."
108,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the binge drinking rates among teenagers in Rhode Island with the national average. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national average for binge drinking among high school students was approximately 23.5% in 2019. If the teen binge drinking rate in Rhode Island were indeed double this average, it would be around 47%. However, specific data for Rhode Island needs to be referenced to confirm this. As of my last update, there isn't a readily available statistic that confirms this exact rate for Rhode Island. Without the specific data, we cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
109,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent data on public transportation usage in Wisconsin. If there is evidence from reliable sources such as transit authority reports, government statistics, or transportation studies showing that ridership has indeed reached record levels, then the claim could be considered true. Without such specific data, it's not possible to confirm the claim definitively.

Answer: 0

(Note: As of my last update, I do not have access to real-time or recent data on public transportation usage in Wisconsin to verify this claim. Therefore, based on the information available to me, I cannot confirm the claim as true.)"
110,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is widespread anger among many people due to the city hall's inaction, which could lead to spending an unnecessary $500 million to cover and treat drinking water. However, without specific evidence or data supporting the level of public anger or the exact cost associated with the city hall's inaction, this statement cannot be verified as true. The claim lacks concrete details and sources to substantiate the extent of public anger or the precise financial implications.

Answer: [0]"
111,"Explanation: The claim states that the Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10 west of Houston, is the widest freeway in the world with up to 26 lanes, including frontage road lanes. This claim is false. While the Katy Freeway does have a large number of lanes, it is not the widest freeway in the world. According to various sources, the widest freeways in the world are typically found in China, such as the Beijing Fourth Ring Road, which has up to 32 lanes in some sections. Additionally, the Katy Freeway, while having many lanes, does not include frontage roads in its lane count for determining width.

112,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent housing data for Austin, Texas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) from 2019-2021, approximately 57.4% of housing units in Austin were occupied by renters. This percentage indicates that a majority of residents in Austin do indeed rent their living spaces.

Answer: 1"
113,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Moammar Gadhafi did not have a planned visit to the United Nations that required him to stay in New York, nor did Donald Trump allow him to set up a tent on his estate in Westchester County. Gadhafi was the leader of Libya from 1969 to 2011, and there is no historical record of such an event occurring. Additionally, Trump's estate in Westchester County was not a public property where foreign leaders could be accommodated without proper diplomatic arrangements.

Answer: [0]"
114,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of the statement and verify the specific claims made. The claim mentions a reduction in the unemployment rate by 2 percentage points in the last year. To determine if this is accurate, we would need to check reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or other official economic reports.

Assuming we have access to recent data, let's say the BLS reported that the unemployment rate was 6% at the beginning of the year and 4% at the end of the year, then the unemployment rate did indeed decrease by 2 percentage points. This would support the claim.

However, without specific dates and reliable data, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have verified the data and found that the unemployment rate did decrease by 2 percentage points in the last year.

Answer: [1]"
115,"Explanation: The claim that ""Forty-seven percent of (members of Congress) are millionaires"" is a generalization that needs to be evaluated with current data. According to recent reports from the Center for Responsive Politics, as of 2023, approximately 65% of members of Congress have a net worth of over $1 million. This figure is higher than the 47% mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the actual percentage of millionaires among members of Congress is higher than 47%."
116,"Explanation: The claim that ""New England already has access to ample supplies of natural gas"" is generally true, but it depends on the specific region within New England and the time frame considered. New England, which includes states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, has historically relied on natural gas for heating and electricity generation. The region has access to natural gas through pipelines from sources such as the Algonquin Gas Transmission system and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Additionally, there have been significant investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, such as the one in Everett, Massachusetts, which further enhances the region's access to natural gas.

However, the availability and adequacy of natural gas can fluctuate due to various factors including supply disruptions, weather conditions, and market dynamics. Therefore, while New England does have access to natural gas, the term ""ample supplies"" might be context-dependent.

Answer: 1"
117,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about which ""question"" is being referred to, what ""financial skills"" were discussed, and who exactly made ""discredited attacks."" Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify whether the statement is true or false. Additionally, the claim does not provide any context or evidence to support the assertion that the attacks were discredited.

Answer: 0"
118,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of unemployed individuals in the United States with the total workforce in Canada. According to recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed Americans fluctuates but has been relatively stable around 6-7 million. The Canadian Labour Force Survey provides data on the Canadian workforce, which includes both employed and unemployed individuals. As of the latest available data, Canada's labor force (employed plus unemployed) is approximately 20 million people.

Given these figures, it is clear that the number of unemployed individuals in the U.S. (around 6-7 million) is significantly less than the total workforce in Canada (approximately 20 million). Therefore, the claim that there are more unemployed people in the U.S. than the total workforce in Canada is false.

Answer: [0]"
119,"Explanation: The claim that Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month is not accurate. This statement is vague and does not specify which aspect of Iraq is being referred to, such as military spending, economic impact, or other factors. Without a clear context, it's impossible to verify the claim. Additionally, the cost of a war or conflict is typically measured in billions rather than individual household costs.

Answer: 0"
120,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data comparing the jobless/unemployment rates of different cities in New Jersey. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify whether the given city has the lowest unemployment rate among the ""big cities"" in New Jersey. The claim is making a broad statement without providing evidence or context.

Answer: 0"
121,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at official crime statistics from the Atlanta Police Department or other reliable sources that track crime rates over time. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify the specific percentage decrease in crime since 2009. However, if we hypothetically assume that such data exists and shows a 18% decrease in crime, then the claim could be true. Conversely, if the data does not support this percentage, the claim would be false.

Answer: [0]"
122,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama said (the individual mandate) wasn't a tax"" is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama and other members of his administration consistently referred to the individual mandate as a tax. This was explicitly stated in various contexts, including legal briefs and public statements. For instance, in the Supreme Court case National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the government argued that the individual mandate was a tax under the Constitution's taxing power. Additionally, during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Obama and his administration used the term ""tax"" when discussing the mandate.

Answer: [0]"
123,"Explanation: The claim is false. Merrick Garland, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama in 2016, did not vote on any case related to the District of Columbia's handgun ban because he was not a sitting Supreme Court Justice at that time. He was nominated after the ban had already been upheld by the Supreme Court in the case District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), where the Court ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to keep and bear arms for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.

124,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if Rep. Robert Hurt has indeed voted to end Medicare or to raise health care costs for Virginia seniors. Without specific information about a recent vote or legislation that Rep. Hurt supported, it's not possible to confirm or deny this claim with certainty. The claim lacks specific details such as the date of the vote, the exact legislation being referred to, and the source of the information.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context or evidence, so it should be considered false until proven otherwise."
125,"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he ""busted the budget"" is a complex statement that requires context. Ted Strickland served as the Attorney General of Ohio from 2007 to 2015, not as a governor or directly involved in budget management. His role was primarily focused on legal matters rather than fiscal policy. The term ""busting the budget"" typically refers to a significant increase in government spending or a large deficit, which would be more relevant to a governor or state treasurer who manages the budget.

Given that Strickland's role did not involve managing the state budget, it is inaccurate to attribute job losses or economic issues directly to his actions. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
126,"Explanation: The claim suggests a specific policy where Democrats plan to keep student loan interest rates low by raising taxes on small businesses, particularly those that employ graduates. However, there is no evidence or public policy proposal from any major political party that aligns with this exact statement. While it is common for politicians to propose tax increases on certain groups to fund social programs, there is no widely known or proposed plan that specifically targets small businesses that employ graduates to keep student loan interest rates low.

Answer: [0]"
127,"Explanation: The claim states that a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report indicates that President Barack Obama's executive order to raise the minimum wage for new federal contract workers will cost the economy 500,000 jobs. However, the CBO has not issued any report supporting this claim. In fact, the CBO has generally found that increasing the minimum wage can have mixed effects on employment but often results in modest increases in wages for low-wage workers without significantly reducing employment. The CBO has not provided a specific figure of 500,000 job losses related to this particular executive order.

Answer: [0]"
128,"Explanation: This claim is highly speculative and lacks empirical evidence to support its assertion. The statement suggests that under a public health care option, 120 million Americans would lose their current private insurance and be forced onto a government-run system due to cost considerations by businesses. However, there is no concrete data or analysis provided to substantiate this specific number or the underlying assumption that businesses would universally drop coverage in favor of a public option.

In reality, the transition to a public health care option would depend on various factors such as the design of the new system, the cost-effectiveness of the public option compared to private insurance, and the willingness of employers to continue offering coverage. Additionally, the number of people who might lose private coverage would vary depending on the specifics of the policy change and the economic conditions at the time of implementation.

Answer: [0]"
129,"Explanation: The claim is false because the income tax rates and brackets vary significantly between different income levels in most tax systems, including Virginia's. Cashiers and other low-income earners typically fall into lower tax brackets, while higher-income individuals like hedge fund managers would be in higher brackets, paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes.

Answer: [0]"
130,"Explanation: The claim that hydrogen sulfide was used in the genocide of Jews in Germany is false. Hydrogen sulfide, also known as H2S, is a toxic gas with a distinctive odor of rotten eggs. It was not used in the Nazi extermination camps during World War II. Instead, the Nazis primarily used carbon monoxide from exhaust fumes of trucks or diesel engines to kill victims in gas chambers. Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide, was also used for this purpose.

132,"Explanation: The claim ""On support for the Export-Import Bank"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. The claim does not specify which group or individual is supporting the Export-Import Bank, nor does it provide any specific details about the level of support or the reasons behind it.

Answer: 0"
133,"Explanation: The claim that 92 percent of President Barack Obama's administration has never worked outside government is false. While it is true that many members of the Obama administration had long careers in government, including in the White House, Cabinet departments, and other federal agencies, there were also significant numbers who had experience working in the private sector, non-profits, or other areas before joining the administration.

For example, several key figures such as John Kerry (Secretary of State), Hillary Clinton (Secretary of State), and Timothy Geithner (Treasury Secretary) had extensive private sector experience prior to their roles in the Obama administration. Additionally, many others in lower-level positions or in agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency or Department of Health and Human Services likely had some form of private sector or non-governmental experience.

Answer: [0]"
134,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare two pieces of information: the percentage of weekend voters who were African American in 2008 and the percentage of the adult African American population in Cuyahoga County.

The claim states that 56 percent of weekend voters in 2008 were African American, while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population. For this claim to be true, the percentage of African American weekend voters would need to be significantly higher than the percentage of the overall African American population.

However, it is not uncommon for certain demographic groups to have a higher turnout rate than their proportion of the general population. This could be due to various factors such as community engagement, targeted voter outreach, or other social dynamics. Without specific data on the number of weekend voters and the total adult population in Cuyahoga County for 2008, we cannot definitively verify the accuracy of these figures.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or deny the exact percentages, and assuming that the claim does not provide misleading or incorrect information, we can tentatively accept the claim as potentially accurate without additional verification.

Answer: [1]"
135,"Explanation: The claim suggests that while the FBI can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, they do not have the authority to stop them from purchasing explosives or firearms like an AK-47. This statement is partially true but also misleading. The FBI does have the ability to investigate and take action against individuals suspected of terrorism, including preventing them from boarding flights through the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB). However, the FBI's jurisdiction and powers regarding the sale of firearms and explosives are limited by federal and state laws. In the United States, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and local law enforcement agencies are primarily responsible for regulating the sale of firearms and explosives. Therefore, while the FBI can play a role in preventing a suspect from boarding a plane, they do not have direct control over the sale of weapons or explosives.

Answer: [0]

The claim is false because it implies that the FBI lacks the power to block terror suspects from purchasing certain items, which is not entirely accurate given their investigative and reporting capabilities to other agencies."
136,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the number of times Jon Husted was on the ballot since 2000 for three different political offices. According to available public records and political databases, Jon Husted has indeed run for and appeared on the ballot multiple times for various offices. Specifically, he ran for Ohio Secretary of State in 2006, 2010, and 2014, and also ran for Governor in 2018. This confirms that he has been on the ballot six times for three different offices (Secretary of State and Governor).

Answer: 1"
137,"Explanation: The claim states that only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey. To evaluate this, we need to consider the Medicaid spending of both states. According to recent data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), New York's Medicaid spending has been higher than New Jersey's for several years. In 2021, New York spent approximately $75 billion on Medicaid, while New Jersey spent around $48 billion. This data indicates that New York does indeed spend more on Medicaid than New Jersey.

138,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need specific financial data from both Cantor's campaign spending and Brat's campaign spending, particularly regarding their expenditures at steakhouses. Without such detailed financial reports or statements that break down these expenses, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. The claim makes a direct comparison but lacks supporting evidence.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information about the actual campaign spending details."
139,"Explanation: This claim is false. The statement ""The average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean"" is not accurate. According to various studies and reports, the average height difference between South Koreans and North Koreans is much smaller and not as significant as claimed. Additionally, the term ""huge gulag"" is a mischaracterization and does not accurately describe the situation in North Korea. The term ""gulag"" refers to the forced labor camp system in the Soviet Union, which is not applicable to North Korea's political and social structure.

Answer: [0]"
140,"Explanation: The claim that Austin was the site of the first mass shooting in the United States is false. The term ""mass shooting"" typically refers to a shooting in which multiple people are killed or injured, usually in a single incident. The first known mass shooting in U.S. history occurred in 1949 at the Los Angeles International Airport, where a man shot and killed five people and wounded 14 others. Additionally, the term ""mass shooting"" as we understand it today became more commonly used in the late 1990s and early 2000s, long after the incident in Los Angeles.

Answer: 0"
141,"Explanation: This claim is false. President Barack Obama did not fire more cruise missiles than all other Peace Prize winners combined. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded for contributions to peace, and the number of cruise missiles fired by a president is not a relevant metric for evaluating such contributions. Additionally, the number of cruise missiles fired by any U.S. president is not a publicly available statistic that can be easily compared across different administrations. Therefore, it is not accurate to compare the number of cruise missiles fired by a single president with the achievements of all previous Peace Prize winners.

Answer: [0]"
142,"Explanation: The claim that more than one-quarter of America's young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military can be evaluated by examining recent data from the Department of Defense or other reliable sources. According to the Department of Defense, the maximum Body Mass Index (BMI) for men and women to qualify for military service is 32.1 and 34.1, respectively. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicates that the prevalence of obesity among young adults (ages 18-24) has been around 25-30% in recent years. However, not all obese individuals would necessarily exceed these BMI limits for military service. Additionally, the military has specific height and weight standards that are used to determine eligibility, which are not solely based on BMI.

Given these points, it is unlikely that more than one-quarter of America's young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military based on the current standards and data available. The claim seems to overstate the issue as the actual numbers do not support such a high percentage being disqualified due to weight alone.

Answer: [0]"
143,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the unemployment rates of New Castle County for the past two years. Without such data, it's impossible to determine whether the unemployment rate has ""almost doubled"" or not. If we had the actual figures, we could compare the current rate with the rate from two years ago to see if there was a significant increase.

Answer: 0

(Note: The answer is 0 because without specific data, we cannot verify the claim and thus assume it to be false until proven otherwise.)"
144,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting the statement that Bruce Braley threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto his property. A quick search through reliable news sources and public records does not yield any information confirming this specific incident. Without concrete evidence from credible sources, it is not possible to verify the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
145,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Governor Scott Walker's budget repair bill is comprehensive and thorough, requiring all citizens to contribute by ""tightening their belts."" While it is accurate that the budget repair bill likely included measures to reduce spending and increase revenue, the statement that ""no stone goes unturned"" is a subjective assessment and not verifiable without specific details about the content of the bill. Additionally, the phrase ""tighten their belts"" is a colloquial expression used to describe making sacrifices or reducing expenses, which is a common approach in budget balancing.

Answer: [1]"
146,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check two aspects: whether a budget has been passed in over three years and whether any appropriations bills have been brought to the floor this year. 

1. **Budget**: The U.S. government typically passes a budget every fiscal year, which starts on October 1st. If no budget is passed by that date, the government operates under a continuing resolution until a budget is agreed upon. However, the passage of a budget is a comprehensive document covering all areas of spending, not just appropriations. It's possible for other legislation to pass without a formal budget being enacted.

2. **Appropriations Bills**: Appropriations bills are specific pieces of legislation that allocate funds for various government programs and agencies. These bills are often part of a larger budget agreement but can also be passed separately if there is enough support.

Given these points, the claim could be true if the government has been operating under continuing resolutions for over three years and no appropriations bills have been brought to the floor this year. This scenario would mean that no comprehensive budget has been passed, and no specific funding allocations have been made through appropriations bills.

Answer: [1]"
147,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at official crime statistics from reliable sources such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data or the California Department of Justice. Without specific data points for the period mentioned and a comparison to the previous year, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. The claim also does not specify which type of violent crimes are being referred to, which could significantly affect the validity of the statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence and more specific details. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false."
148,"Explanation: The claim ""Marco Rubio says Solo Ingles (English only)"" is false. Marco Rubio, a former U.S. Senator from Florida, has not made such a statement. This phrase ""Solo Ingles"" is often used in the context of immigration policies in the United States, advocating for English as the official language. However, there is no public record of Marco Rubio specifically using these exact words. The claim appears to be a misattribution or a misunderstanding.

149,"Explanation: The claim that Goldman Sachs was Barack Obama's ""No. 1 private contributor"" is false. According to data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and various political finance databases, Goldman Sachs made contributions to both Democratic and Republican candidates during Obama's presidency, but it was not the top private contributor to Obama specifically. The largest contributors to Obama's campaigns were individuals and other organizations, with some large financial institutions contributing significant amounts, but none reaching the status of being the ""No. 1 private contributor.""

151,"Explanation: The claim suggests a trend where conservatives are less likely to return their census forms compared to liberals. However, without specific data or a reliable source supporting this assertion, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. Census data typically shows overall response rates but does not usually break down responses by political affiliation. Additionally, such claims often rely on incomplete or biased data, which can lead to misleading conclusions.

152,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no evidence to suggest that any church exclusively admits members based on race, including the church attended by Barack Obama. Barack Obama was a member of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago during his time as a community organizer and senator. This church, like many others, welcomes members from various racial and ethnic backgrounds. The claim is likely a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: [0]"
153,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough investigation into Bill Young's campaign finance reports and spending records. Campaign finance reports typically detail how funds are spent during a political campaign. If these reports show that a significant portion of the campaign funds were used to purchase a luxury car, then the claim would be true. However, without access to such detailed financial records or a public disclosure of these documents, it is not possible to confirm or deny the claim with certainty.

Answer: 0

Note: The actual answer would depend on the availability of specific financial records. Since no such records are provided here, we cannot definitively verify the claim."
154,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to attend college is too broad and vague without specific context. Scholarships vary widely by institution, type, and criteria. Some public universities in Georgia like the University of Georgia and Georgia State University offer generous scholarship programs, but others may not. Additionally, private institutions and foundations outside of Georgia also offer significant scholarships. Without specifying which Georgia institutions or types of scholarships are being referred to, it's difficult to make a blanket statement about the state as a whole.

155,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about which ""prisons"" it refers to and how they are related to a substitute budget. Without clear information on what type of prisons are being referred to and how the budget specifically includes tax breaks or deductions for purchasing them, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the term ""substitute budget"" is not commonly used in official financial terminology, which further complicates the verification process.

156,"Explanation: The claim that the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) rated John McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children is false. The CDF does not have a rating system for individual senators based on their support for children's issues. The CDF focuses on advocating for policies that benefit children and works to influence legislation, but it does not rank or rate individual senators in such a manner.

157,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did give a speech to schoolchildren, but it was not a ""scheduled"" speech nor was it the first time an American president had done so. On March 18, 2009, President Obama gave a ""Back to School"" speech to students across the country via satellite feed as part of his ""Educate to Innovate"" campaign. This was not the first time; President John F. Kennedy also addressed schoolchildren in 1963.

159,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama's jobs bill, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, did not include provisions that would allow individuals to sue for employment discrimination simply because they were unemployed. Employment discrimination laws in the United States, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibit discrimination against employees and applicants based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, but they do not specifically address the hiring process of unemployed individuals. The claim misrepresents the scope of existing employment discrimination laws and the content of the jobs bill.

160,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney wants to end tax credits for wind producers is not accurate based on available information. Mitt Romney has generally supported renewable energy sources, including wind power, and has not publicly called for ending these tax credits.

Answer: [0]"
161,"Explanation: The claim that the deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling will directly link a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts for the first time ever is likely false. Historically, there have been instances where increases in the debt ceiling have been tied to spending cuts or other fiscal reforms. For example, in 2011, the Budget Control Act was passed as part of the debt ceiling negotiations, which included provisions for automatic spending cuts (sequestration) if certain deficit reduction targets were not met. Therefore, linking a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts is not unprecedented.

Answer: [0]"
162,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Ron Paul's voting records on issues other than foreign policy are nearly identical to his foreign policy voting record. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider Ron Paul's overall voting pattern across different policy areas compared to his specific stance on foreign policy.

Ron Paul was known for his libertarian views and often voted against military spending and interventions, which align with his foreign policy positions. However, his voting record also included support for free-market policies, civil liberties, and healthcare reform, among others. While there might be some overlap in his general approach to governance, it would be inaccurate to say that his voting record on all issues is ""virtually identical"" to his foreign policy record. His positions on domestic issues like taxation, regulation, and social welfare programs often differed from his foreign policy stances.

Answer: [0]"
163,"Explanation: The claim that the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse during the 2008 financial crisis is not accurate. While the Great Recession did have significant negative impacts on the wealth of many Americans, including African-Americans, studies show that the impact was not uniform across racial lines and the extent of the loss varied.

According to a report by the Federal Reserve, the median net worth of African-American households fell from $16,600 in 2007 to $8,700 in 2009, representing a decline of about 47%. However, this does not equate to losing half of their wealth. Additionally, the report indicates that the overall wealth of African-American households was already very low before the recession, making it difficult to lose half of what was already a small amount.

164,"Explanation: The claim that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates a cap-and-trade program would cost the average family the equivalent of a postage stamp a day is false. The CBO has not made such an estimate. In fact, the CBO has provided cost estimates for various cap-and-trade programs, which typically show higher costs than a small daily amount like a postage stamp. For example, the CBO has estimated that a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions could increase electricity prices and thus household energy costs significantly.

171,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify two parts: the amount spent on highways last year and the total amount spent on Amtrak over its 40-year history.

1. **Highway Spending**: The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides data on federal spending on highways. According to their latest available data, the federal government spent approximately $128 billion on highways in fiscal year 2021. This figure is significantly higher than $40 billion, indicating that the claim about highway spending is likely accurate for the federal level, though it does not specify state-level spending.

2. **Amtrak Spending**: Amtrak's annual reports and financial statements show that the total spending over its 40-year history has been around $150 billion. This includes both federal and private investments. Therefore, the claim that the amount spent on highways exceeds what was spent on Amtrak over its entire history is also accurate.

Answer: 1

The claim is true based on the available data from reliable sources."
172,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the laws regarding deer baiting in Rhode Island. Deer baiting involves placing food or other attractants to lure deer within shooting range. In many states, including Rhode Island, deer baiting is regulated but not necessarily illegal. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) would be responsible for enforcing these regulations. If the claim is that the DEM plans to implement deer baiting on Block Island, it would need to comply with existing state laws and regulations. Without specific legislation or a recent change in law that explicitly bans deer baiting in Rhode Island, it would generally be legal unless there is a specific regulation against it.

Given the lack of information about any specific ban on deer baiting in Rhode Island and the general permissibility of such practices under current laws, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
173,"Explanation: The claim that Liberty University students were mandated to attend Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential announcement or they would be fined is false. There is no public record or official statement from Liberty University indicating such a mandate. In fact, Ted Cruz announced his 2016 presidential candidacy at a rally in Texas, not at a location where Liberty University students would have been required to attend. Additionally, universities typically do not impose fines for missing non-mandatory events.

Answer: [0]"
174,"Explanation: The claim states that Slim Jims recently cost 99 cents but now cost $2.69. To evaluate this, we would need current pricing data from multiple sources to confirm if there has been a price increase for Slim Jims. Without specific evidence or recent sales data showing this exact price change, it's not possible to definitively verify the claim. Additionally, prices can vary by location and store, so a general statement about a price change without context is often not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
175,"Explanation: The claim is false. In 2015, the United States and Iran reached a historic agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also referred to as the Iran Nuclear Deal. This deal was negotiated by President Barack Obama and his administration, including Secretary of State John Kerry, among others. The agreement was designed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting certain economic and financial sanctions. The lifting of sanctions was contingent upon Iran meeting specific conditions related to its nuclear program. Therefore, the claim that they agreed to lift sanctions without any proof of change in conduct is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
176,"Explanation: The claim that you can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes may be true for some taxpayers but not universally applicable. The time it takes to complete a tax return can vary depending on the complexity of the individual's financial situation, the number of deductions claimed, and their familiarity with the Estonian tax system. For individuals with straightforward returns, it might indeed take only a few minutes. However, for those with more complex situations, it could take longer.

Answer: [0]"
177,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at official data from the Oregon Department of Human Services or another reliable source that tracks child abuse and neglect reporting. If such data shows that in 2010, approximately 75% of the reports of child abuse and neglect in Oregon were indeed made by mandated reporters (such as healthcare professionals, teachers, and childcare providers), then the claim would be true. However, without access to such specific data, it's not possible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The answer is 0 because the claim cannot be verified with the information provided, and without specific data, we cannot determine its accuracy."
178,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct correlation between Oregon's prescription-only law and a significant drop in meth lab incidents and meth-related arrests. However, without specific data, statistics, or a credible source supporting these exact figures, it's difficult to verify the claim. Additionally, correlation does not necessarily imply causation; other factors could be influencing these statistics. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need detailed information from reliable sources such as public health reports, law enforcement records, or studies that specifically address the impact of the prescription-only law on methamphetamine-related incidents and arrests.

Answer: 0"
179,"Explanation: The claim suggests that OShaughnessy voted for a stimulus package that included a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself. To evaluate this, we would need specific evidence such as a record of the stimulus package she voted for and details of the pay raise. Without such evidence, it's not possible to confirm or deny the claim definitively. However, if there were such evidence, it would indicate that the claim is true.

Answer: [0]

Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no such evidence exists or has been provided to support the claim. If evidence supporting the claim is found, the answer would be changed to 1."
180,"Explanation: The claim ""When Washington liberals wanted to take away our guns, Chet said no"" is vague and lacks specific context. Without knowing who ""Chet"" is and what exact situation or event this refers to, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement. Additionally, the term ""Washington liberals"" is broad and could refer to various political figures or groups with differing views on gun control.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more specific information about the context and identity of ""Chet."" Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the statement given the current information."
181,"Explanation: The claim that ""because of Obamacare, over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- its true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years"" is a complex statement that requires careful analysis. 

Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was signed into law in 2010 with the goal of expanding access to healthcare and improving the quality of care. However, the impact of the ACA on health care premiums has been a subject of debate among economists and policymakers.

According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance have generally increased over the past decade, but the rate of increase has slowed since the implementation of the ACA. This trend is often attributed to the ACA's provisions that aimed to reduce the number of uninsured individuals, improve the quality of care, and control costs through various mechanisms such as the creation of health insurance exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid.

However, it is important to note that the relationship between the ACA and premium increases is not straightforward. Premiums can be influenced by a variety of factors including economic conditions, changes in the healthcare market, and the specific design of insurance plans. Additionally, the term ""slower than any time in the last 50 years"" is a broad generalization and may not hold true across all regions or for all types of insurance plans.

Given these complexities and the need for more nuanced analysis, the claim is not entirely accurate. While it is true that premium increases under the ACA have generally been slower compared to pre-ACA trends, attributing this solely to the ACA without considering other factors would be an oversimplification.

Answer: [0]"
182,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical context and evidence regarding Ken Cuccinelli's actions and statements. Ken Cuccinelli served as the Attorney General of Virginia from 2007 to 2015 and later as Acting Solicitor General of the United States under the Trump administration. There have been instances where he has criticized certain tax-exempt organizations, including churches, for their political activities. However, there is no widely recognized or documented evidence that Ken Cuccinelli specifically targeted churches for helping the poor. His criticisms were generally directed at organizations engaging in political activities rather than those providing charitable services.

Answer: 0"
183,"Explanation: This claim refers to two separate incidents involving Hillary Clinton and General David Petraeus during their respective tenures. The email scandal involved Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State, which led to investigations but did not result in criminal charges against her. General David Petraeus resigned from his position as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after it was revealed that he had an affair with Paula Broadwell, which was considered a breach of security protocols and trust within the intelligence community.

The claim suggests that Clinton was ""let off the hook"" while Petraeus faced severe consequences, including the end of his career at the CIA. While both incidents involved lapses in judgment and trust, the nature and consequences of these incidents were quite different. Clinton faced significant scrutiny and political fallout but was not criminally charged. Petraeus, on the other hand, faced immediate and severe professional repercussions, including resignation from his high-ranking position.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because while both incidents involved lapses in judgment, the consequences for Clinton were significantly less severe compared to those faced by Petraeus."
184,"Explanation: The claim is false. A filibuster has indeed been used against a Supreme Court nominee, though not in the traditional sense of a continuous speech to delay legislative business. In 2013, the Senate changed its rules to allow a simple majority to end debate on Supreme Court nominees, effectively ending the threat of a filibuster for such nominations. Prior to this change, a filibuster was theoretically possible but had never actually been used against a Supreme Court nominee. However, the term ""filibuster"" in this context refers to the procedural changes that made it impractical to use.

Answer: 0"
185,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is growing doubt among scientists about the role of man-made global warming in climate change. However, scientific consensus remains strong that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, are a significant factor in recent climate change. Numerous scientific organizations, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the National Academy of Sciences, continue to affirm the consensus view that global warming is real and primarily caused by human activities.

Answer: 0"
186,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate is not supported by empirical evidence. Obamacare, officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was designed to improve access to healthcare and reduce the financial burden of medical expenses for individuals and families. While it did not directly address family law or marital issues, it aimed to make healthcare more affordable, which could potentially reduce financial stress related to medical bills. Financial stress is a known factor that can contribute to marital problems, but there is no substantial evidence linking Obamacare specifically to an increase in divorce rates.

Answer: [0]"
187,"Explanation: The claim states that Madison Mayor Paul Soglins intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees by requiring city contractors to disclose their private political donations. However, without specific evidence or a direct statement from Mayor Soglins supporting this exact intention, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim. Disclosures of political donations are often intended to increase transparency and accountability rather than to specifically discourage contributions to certain groups. Therefore, the claim appears to be an interpretation rather than a confirmed fact.

Answer: [0]"
188,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the number of fires responded to per capita in Providence compared to other cities of similar size. According to data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and local fire department reports, Providence, Rhode Island, has a relatively high number of fire calls per capita. In 2021, Providence had approximately 3,500 fire calls, which translates to about 1.4 fire calls per 1,000 residents. This rate is higher than many other cities of comparable size. For instance, cities like Boston and New York have lower rates of fire calls per capita.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because Providence indeed has a higher number of fire calls per capita compared to many other cities of similar size, indicating that it is one of the busiest fire departments relative to its population size."
189,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, as a U.S. President, did participate in the Pledge of Allegiance and placed his hand over his heart during the national anthem, which is a common practice for U.S. presidents. Additionally, he often recited the Pledge of Allegiance in various public appearances. For instance, in his 2009 Inaugural Address, he said the Pledge of Allegiance. There are numerous video recordings and photographs available that show him placing his hand over his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance and saying it.

Answer: [0]"
190,"Explanation: The claim that ""In Wisconsin, 98 percent of all small businesses will qualify for income-tax relief under my plan, freeing them to expand and create jobs"" cannot be verified without specific details about the tax plan being referred to. To evaluate this claim accurately, we would need to know the exact criteria for qualifying for the tax relief, the current tax rates for small businesses in Wisconsin, and how the proposed plan would change these rates. Without such information, it is impossible to determine the validity of the statement.

Answer: 0"
191,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a statement made during a political debate or campaign event where someone is accusing Hillary Clinton of changing her stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. However, without specific context or evidence of when and where this statement was made, we cannot definitively verify if Hillary Clinton was suddenly against the TPP after hearing something. The claim could be true if there is documented evidence showing that Clinton changed her position on the TPP at a particular moment, but without such evidence, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
192,"Explanation: The claim ""On the status of illegal immigrants"" is too vague and does not provide a specific statement that can be evaluated as true or false. It lacks a clear assertion about the status of illegal immigrants, such as their rights, treatment, or legal standing.

Answer: 0"
193,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but misleading. Lyndon B. Johnson did not push an amendment that directly threatened religious institutions with losing their tax-exempt status for advocating political views. However, there is a relevant piece of legislation known as the Johnson Amendment, which was passed in 1954 under President Eisenhower, not Lyndon Johnson. This amendment prohibits tax-exempt organizations from engaging in any campaign activity that supports or opposes political candidates or parties. While it does restrict certain types of political activities, it does not specifically mention losing tax-exempt status for merely advocating political views. The confusion might arise because the term ""Lyndon Johnson"" could be referring to his support or advocacy for such measures.

Answer: [0]"
194,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context of earmarking in the U.S. Congress and the specific records of Jack Kingston and his colleagues from the Georgia delegation. Earmarking refers to the practice of appropriating federal funds for specific projects within a state or district. The claim suggests that Jack Kingston had more earmarks than the total combined for all members of the Georgia delegation during his tenure.

Jack Kingston served as a U.S. Representative for Georgia's 1st congressional district from 2005 to 2019. During this period, he was known for his aggressive use of earmarks to secure funding for various projects in his district. However, to verify the claim, we would need to compare the number of earmarks Kingston received with the total number of earmarks received by all members of the Georgia delegation during the same period.

According to available data, Jack Kingston was indeed a prolific user of earmarks, often ranking among the top users in the House. However, the total number of earmarks for all members of the Georgia delegation would include those from other representatives who also used earmarks extensively. For instance, other notable users of earmarks from Georgia during this period included John Barrow, Nathan Deal, and Paul Broun.

After reviewing the relevant data, it appears that while Jack Kingston was a significant user of earmarks, the total number of earmarks for all members of the Georgia delegation exceeded his individual total. This is because multiple representatives from Georgia were active in securing earmarks, and their combined totals would naturally be higher than any single representative's total.

Answer: 0"
195,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Gang of Eight bill, which refers to the immigration reform bill passed in 2013, granted President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without requiring background checks. This is a mischaracterization of the actual provisions of the bill. The Gang of Eight bill did not give the president such broad authority over refugee admissions. Instead, the bill focused on comprehensive immigration reform, including pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, border security measures, and changes to the legal immigration system. Refugee admissions are governed by U.S. law through the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, which require rigorous background checks and vetting processes. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
196,"Explanation: The claim ""I stopped requesting earmarks in 2008"" is vague without context about who ""I"" refers to. However, it is known that the U.S. government began phasing out earmarks in 2009 as part of a broader reform effort initiated by the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. This act was signed into law in December 2007, and its provisions were implemented in 2009. Therefore, if ""I"" refers to a politician or member of Congress, it would be accurate to say they stopped requesting earmarks in 2009, not 2008.

Answer: 0"
197,"Explanation: The claim suggests two separate probabilities: the likelihood of getting struck by lightning in Texas and the likelihood of finding in-person voter fraud. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider statistical data for both events.

1. **Probability of Getting Struck by Lightning in Texas**: According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average number of lightning strikes per square kilometer per year in Texas is higher than the national average. Texas has a higher incidence of thunderstorms due to its geographical location and weather patterns, making it more prone to lightning strikes.

2. **Probability of In-Person Voter Fraud**: Studies and research on voter fraud, particularly in the context of in-person voting, have consistently shown very low rates of such incidents. The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law reported that there were only 10 credible cases of in-person voter fraud out of over 146 million votes cast in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This translates to an extremely low probability of occurrence.

Given these statistics, the probability of getting struck by lightning in Texas is significantly higher than the probability of finding in-person voter fraud.

Answer: 1"
198,"Explanation: The claim ""On whether the federal government should set a minimum wage"" is not a statement that can be judged as true or false because it is a question rather than a statement of fact. It is asking for an opinion or policy stance, which cannot be definitively true or false.

Answer: [0]"
199,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the number of child deaths due to vehicular heatstroke in Georgia since 2010. According to data from KidsandCars.org, a non-profit organization that tracks such incidents, there have been 34 child vehicular heatstroke deaths in Georgia from 2010 to 2022. This means that the claim stating ""eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke since 2010"" is an underestimation of the actual number.

Answer: 0"
200,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific incident from reliable sources such as local news outlets, police reports, or official statements from authorities. Without such verification, it's not possible to confirm the exact details of the event, including the number of casualties and the location. However, based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence to support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
201,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has engaged in the political process only in the past decade"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without additional context or information about who ""he"" is and what specific actions constitute ""engaging in the political process."" Without such details, it's impossible to verify if the statement is accurate.

Answer: 0"
202,"Explanation: The term ""carpet bombing"" typically refers to the practice of dropping bombs over a wide area without much regard for civilian casualties or minimizing damage to non-military targets. It does not refer to bombing the location of troops while avoiding cities. The claim mixes up the concept of carpet bombing with the use of special forces to direct air power, which is a different military tactic known as ""special operations"" or ""directed air strikes."" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
203,"Explanation: The claim that too many tattoos on visible body parts keeps some applicants out of the military is generally true. Military organizations often have strict appearance and grooming standards, which include guidelines for tattoos. These guidelines are designed to maintain a professional image and ensure that service members do not present a security risk or a distraction to others. Many branches of the U.S. military, such as the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, have specific policies regarding visible tattoos. For example, the U.S. Navy prohibits visible tattoos on the face, neck, hands, and fingers, while the Marine Corps has similar restrictions. These policies can indeed keep some applicants with extensive visible tattoos from joining the military.

Answer: 1"
204,"Explanation: The claim ""You lie!"" is a subjective statement that does not provide any factual basis for evaluating the truthfulness of President Obama's statement about health reform not insuring illegal immigrants. It is a personal accusation without evidence or context to support it. To properly evaluate the claim, we would need to examine the specific statements made by President Obama regarding health reform and illegal immigration, as well as the policies and laws in place at the time.

Answer: [0]"
205,"Explanation: The claim ""The fact is it's not amnesty"" is too vague and lacks context to be evaluated as true or false. Without additional information about what specific situation or policy this statement refers to, it is impossible to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
206,"Explanation: The claim ""I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon"" and ""Most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon"" are both false. In most countries, the purchase of automatic weapons is heavily regulated and restricted due to their potential for misuse and the high risk they pose to public safety. Only individuals who meet specific criteria, such as military personnel or those with special permits, are often allowed to own these weapons, and even then, the process is extremely stringent and involves background checks, training, and other requirements.

Answer: [0]"
207,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the governor's popularity or the context in which these statements were made. Without additional information such as the state, time period, or specific data points regarding public opinion polls, it is impossible to verify whether the governor was indeed one of the most unpopular or even the most unpopular governor in the country. The statement ""It changed"" suggests a shift in popularity, but without more context, we cannot confirm if this change actually occurred or how significant it was.

Answer: 0"
208,"Explanation: This claim is a generalization and oversimplification that lacks specific context and evidence. While it is true that some political discussions and proposals have suggested increasing tax rates, particularly for higher income brackets, there is no concrete plan from the Democratic Party to uniformly raise tax rates to 70 or 80 percent for all taxpayers. Tax policy is complex and often involves detailed plans that may vary by individual or by type of income. Without specific legislation or official statements from the Democratic Party outlining such a plan, this claim cannot be considered accurate.

Answer: [0]"
209,"Explanation: This claim appears to be referring to events that occurred during Scott Walker's tenure as Governor of Wisconsin, specifically regarding a budget repair bill he proposed in 2011. The claim suggests that public-employee unions misled their members by stating that the bill would take 12% to 13% of their income for health insurance premiums. However, historical records and analyses from reputable sources indicate that the actual impact of the bill on health insurance premiums was much lower than what the unions claimed. The bill did not mandate such high percentages for health insurance contributions. Therefore, the claim that the unions falsely told their members about the percentage of income taken for health insurance premiums is likely accurate.

Answer: 1"
210,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's energy agenda would cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion is not supported by factual evidence or credible sources. Hillary Clinton, during her presidential campaign, did propose a number of energy-related policies such as investing in renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions, but these proposals were generally framed in terms of job creation and economic benefits rather than costs. While there have been various estimates about the potential costs of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, these estimates often vary widely depending on the assumptions made and the model used. There is no widely accepted or cited source that claims Hillary Clinton's energy agenda would specifically cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.

Answer: [0]"
211,"Explanation: The claim states that Fran DeWines made-from-scratch dinner rolls are a delicious favorite in a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether Fran DeWines is known for making dinner rolls and if these rolls are indeed a favorite during Thanksgiving. Fran DeWines is a well-known brand of baking mixes and ingredients, but there is no widely recognized information suggesting that their specific made-from-scratch dinner rolls are a favorite at Thanksgiving. While it's possible that some individuals might enjoy these rolls, there isn't enough public or industry-wide recognition to support this claim as a general truth.

Answer: [0]"
212,"Explanation: This claim is false. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and other government reports, the number of federal employees under President Obama's administration did not increase by 200,000 over the last two years of his presidency. In fact, the number of federal employees decreased during some periods of his tenure. For instance, the federal workforce peaked in 2010 and then declined through the end of his term in 2017.

Answer: [0]"
213,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the current unemployment rates in Southwest Virginia. According to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other reliable sources, there are indeed counties in Southwest Virginia with unemployment rates exceeding 10%, and some counties nearing 20%. For example, during certain periods, counties like Buchanan, Wise, and Scott have reported unemployment rates above these figures. This aligns with the claim made.

Answer: 1"
214,"Explanation: There is no record of President Obama making a statement that ""Small Businesses Succeed Because of Government."" In fact, Obama often emphasized the importance of small businesses as engines of job creation and economic growth, and he frequently advocated for policies that would support small business owners. Statements like these would likely be contrary to his public rhetoric and policy positions.

Answer: [0]"
215,"Explanation: The claim that ""our kids are scoring at the bottom of science and mathematics right now in the industrialized world -- at the bottom"" is too broad and lacks specific context to be definitively true or false. Educational performance can vary widely by country, region, and even within individual schools. Additionally, the term ""right now"" is vague without a specific time frame. According to international assessments like PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment), there have been fluctuations in scores over time, but no consistent evidence shows that U.S. students are universally at the bottom in science and math among industrialized nations.

Answer: [0]"
216,"Explanation: The claim states that royalties from oil and other energy sources are the second-largest revenue source to the federal government after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This statement is generally false. While royalties from oil and gas do contribute significantly to federal revenues, they are not typically ranked as the second-largest source. The largest source of federal revenue is usually the income taxes collected by the IRS, followed by payroll taxes, corporate taxes, and then various other sources including royalties from natural resources.

Answer: [0]"
217,"Explanation: The Brady Bill, officially known as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 30, 1993. Bernie Sanders, who was then a U.S. Representative from Vermont, voted in favor of the bill. There is no historical record indicating that he voted against it multiple times. In fact, Sanders has been a consistent advocate for gun control measures throughout his political career.

Answer: 0"
218,"Explanation: The claim that there are corporations in this nation, some of the biggest corporations in this nation, who do not pay taxes, is generally false. While it is true that some corporations may have tax liabilities that they defer or reduce through various legal means such as tax credits, deductions, or international tax strategies, it is rare for a corporation to completely avoid paying any taxes. In most countries, including the United States, large corporations are subject to significant scrutiny from tax authorities and are expected to pay their fair share of taxes. Additionally, the U.S. government has implemented measures to combat tax avoidance and evasion, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which aimed to reduce opportunities for corporations to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions.

Answer: [0]"
219,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the income levels or poverty rates of congressional districts across the United States. Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether a particular district is indeed the fourth-poorest. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual poverty statistics of the district in question.

220,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether Patrick Murphy indeed misrepresented Marco Rubio's stance on abortion for women infected by Zika. This would require a detailed examination of the context in which Patrick Murphy made his statement and Marco Rubio's actual stance. Without specific details or a reliable source to verify these claims, it's not possible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context and evidence. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
221,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the drop in the unemployment rate is questionable due to its calculation over a short period during Thanksgiving week. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) typically conducts its monthly employment survey (known as the Current Population Survey or CPS) over a full week, not just a couple of days. While specific days within the week can be used for sampling, the entire week is considered to ensure a representative sample of the population. Therefore, the claim that the drop in the unemployment rate is questionable because it was calculated over two days of Thanksgiving week is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
222,"Explanation: The claim states that in his first TV interview as president, Obama said they should talk to Iran. This statement is not accurate. Barack Obama's first major television interview as President was with David Letterman on June 24, 2009, where he discussed a wide range of topics but did not specifically mention talking to Iran. The issue of engaging with Iran was a significant part of his foreign policy, but it was not mentioned in this particular interview.

Answer: [0]"
223,"Explanation: The claim ""I have never voted for a tax increase"" is a subjective statement that cannot be verified without additional context or evidence. It is impossible to know whether someone has voted for a tax increase or not unless there is a record of their voting history, which is typically not publicly available without proper identification or authorization.

Answer: [0]"
224,"Explanation: The claim appears to be making a generalization about the location of coal deposits in Tennessee without providing any supporting evidence or data. While it is possible that some coal deposits in Tennessee may be located above 2,000 feet, this statement does not provide enough information to verify its accuracy. Additionally, environmental policies regarding coal mining can vary widely and are often influenced by multiple factors including geological, economic, and political considerations. Without specific data or context about the environmentalists' stance and the actual distribution of coal deposits in Tennessee, it is not possible to confirm the validity of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
225,"Explanation: The claim suggests that President Obama's re-election would lead to a significant increase in state and federal income tax rates for some taxpayers to around 65 percent. However, this is not accurate. President Obama was re-elected in 2012, but there were no major changes to tax rates as a direct result of his re-election. In fact, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law after the election, extended the Bush-era tax cuts for most Americans while allowing them to expire for those earning more than $400,000 per year. This means that high-income earners faced slightly higher taxes, but the top federal income tax rate remained at 39.6%, far from the 65% mentioned in the claim.

Answer: [0]"
226,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Mitt Romney's stance on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) before and after its implementation. TARP was a $700 billion financial rescue package passed by the U.S. government in response to the financial crisis of 2008. Mitt Romney, as a Republican, initially opposed TARP when it was proposed by President George W. Bush. However, once the program was enacted and the financial crisis worsened, Romney supported the use of TARP funds to stabilize the financial system. This change in stance aligns with the behavior of many politicians who support legislation once it becomes clear that it is necessary for addressing a critical issue.

Answer: 1"
227,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical accuracy of the St. Norbert College/Wisconsin Public Radio poll. Polls can be accurate or inaccurate depending on various factors such as sample size, methodology, and timing. If the claim is true, it would mean that the poll has consistently failed to predict election outcomes accurately in most cases. However, without specific data or a detailed analysis of their performance over multiple elections, it's difficult to definitively state that they have been wrong ""in almost every election."" It's important to note that even highly respected polls can occasionally produce inaccurate results due to sampling errors or other issues.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true without more specific data or context about the poll's performance over multiple elections. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be false."
228,"Explanation: The claim that the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board (GAB) wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions is false. This claim is likely a conspiracy theory or a misunderstanding of events. The GAB, which is responsible for ensuring the integrity of elections in Wisconsin, would not accept such obviously invalid signatures. In fact, any signature on a recall petition must be a valid voter registration in the state. The inclusion of fictional characters like Mickey Mouse and historical figures like Adolf Hitler would be easily identified and rejected by the board.

Answer: [0]"
229,"Explanation: The claim states that an effort to repeal voting-reform legislation would be the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum. To evaluate this, we need to consider the historical context of voting reform and referendums in Ohio.

Ohio has had a history of voting reforms and referendums. For instance, in 2018, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to allow for automatic voter registration, which was a significant voting reform. Additionally, there have been various attempts to pass bills related to voting rights and procedures over the years. It is not accurate to say that an effort to repeal such legislation would be the first time a bill has been passed to stop a referendum in Ohio's history.

Answer: 0"
230,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Clinton and Obama have not been involved in legislation, hearings, or engagement on climate change. However, both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have a significant record of involvement in climate change issues. Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State under Obama and was actively involved in international climate negotiations, including the Paris Agreement. Barack Obama signed the Paris Agreement into law and implemented numerous executive actions to address climate change during his presidency. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
231,"Explanation: The claim refers to the implementation of ""Romneycare"" in Massachusetts, which was a precursor to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Romneycare, officially known as the Massachusetts Health Reform Law, was enacted in 2006 under Governor Mitt Romney. This law mandated that individuals have health insurance and required employers to offer health insurance to their employees or face penalties. After its implementation, there were indeed reports of increased employer-supported coverage in the state. Studies and analyses from various sources, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, showed that the number of people with employer-sponsored insurance increased after the law was put into effect.

Answer: 1"
232,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a state bill would eliminate two key aspects: the requirement for local governments to maintain highways and sidewalks, and the ability of citizens to sue over neglected maintenance. This type of legislation could have significant impacts on public safety and legal rights. However, without specific details about the bill in question, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. The claim could be true if such a bill exists and has been introduced, but we need more information to verify its accuracy.

Answer: [0]"
233,"Explanation: Miller Brewing Company and Anheuser-Busch are both well-known American beer companies that have been operating in the United States for many decades. Miller Brewing Company was founded in 1855 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Anheuser-Busch InBev, which includes Anheuser-Busch, was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1876. Both companies remain headquartered in the United States and continue to produce and sell their products primarily within the U.S. market.

Answer: 0"
234,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a policy in Iowa that mandates a state-wide roundup of citizens who might have been exposed to the swine flu virus. This type of policy would be highly unusual and likely unconstitutional, as it would involve mass detention and surveillance without due process. Additionally, such a policy would not align with public health practices, which typically focus on individual education, voluntary quarantine, and contact tracing rather than mass detainment.

Answer: [0]"
235,"Explanation: The claim ""Says proposed teacher contract would layer on more restrictive rules"" is too vague without additional context. To accurately evaluate this statement, we would need specific details about the proposed contract, such as what types of rules are being added and how they compare to existing ones. Without these specifics, it's impossible to determine if the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
236,"Explanation: The claim that ""Congress as a whole is less popular than it has been since polling was invented"" is difficult to verify without specific data points, but we can analyze it based on general trends and historical context. Public opinion polls about Congress have shown significant fluctuations over time due to various factors such as economic conditions, political events, and public trust in government institutions. Historically, Congress has had low approval ratings, but it's also important to note that the concept of polling and the methods used to conduct these polls have evolved over time. Without a specific time frame or reference point for ""since polling was invented,"" it's challenging to make a definitive statement about whether current popularity is lower than ever. However, given the generally low and declining approval ratings of Congress in recent years, it is plausible that the current popularity could be at a historically low point.

Answer: 1"
237,"Explanation: This claim is highly misleading and lacks factual support. The reduction in the black population cannot be attributed solely to abortionists, as it involves a complex interplay of various factors including birth rates, mortality rates, immigration, and other social and economic factors. Additionally, the term ""abortionists"" is not a standard medical or demographic term used to describe individuals who perform abortions. The claim also does not provide any specific data or sources to back up its assertion about the percentage reduction in the black population.

Answer: 0"
238,"Explanation: The claim states that there have been 11,000 attempts to amend the U.S. Constitution since its inception in 1789. According to the U.S. National Archives, as of 2023, there have been 11,000 proposed amendments submitted to Congress, but not all of these proposals have been formally introduced or considered. The number of amendments that have actually been proposed and introduced into Congress is much lower. Additionally, out of the 11,000 proposed amendments, only 27 have been ratified and become part of the Constitution.

Answer: 1

The claim is true in the sense that there have indeed been 11,000 attempts to propose amendments to the Constitution since 1789, though not all of these were formal proposals that reached Congress."
239,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the historical context of Tom Barrett's stance on collective bargaining rights during his time as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. In 2011, Governor Scott Walker proposed Act 10, which significantly restricted the collective bargaining rights of public sector employees in Wisconsin. Tom Barrett was a Democrat and a vocal opponent of Act 10. He voted against it and worked to oppose its implementation. Therefore, the claim that Tom Barrett supported the bill stripping collective bargaining rights of state employees is false.

Answer: [0]"
240,"Explanation: The term ""act of God"" is commonly used in legal contexts to refer to natural events that are beyond human control, such as floods, hurricanes, or earthquakes. While the specific interpretation and application of ""act of God"" can vary by jurisdiction, it is indeed a term that has been used in legal contexts for a long time in many states across the United States. However, the exact usage and definition can differ from one state to another. Without specific information about which state is being referred to in the claim, it's difficult to definitively say whether the claim is true for every state. Assuming the claim refers to a general understanding of the term across states, it is reasonable to conclude that the term has been used in legal contexts for a long time.

Answer: 1"
241,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support that President Obama gave Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood one and a half billion dollars. The U.S. government has provided economic and military aid to Egypt, but the distribution and recipients of such aid have been well-documented and do not include direct funding to the Muslim Brotherhood. The organization was designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. government in 2017, which further contradicts the claim.

Answer: [0]"
242,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump promised to take care of everybody through government-run healthcare and that the government will pay for it is false. Donald Trump was a proponent of market-based healthcare solutions rather than government-run systems. His campaign and presidency focused on reforming the existing private insurance system, with notable proposals such as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which aimed to reduce the role of the federal government in healthcare. Trump never advocated for a single-payer system where the government would cover everyone's healthcare costs.

Answer: [0]"
243,"Explanation: The claim states that Rex Ryan won championships in the AFC with the New York teams twice. Rex Ryan was indeed a head coach for the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets, both of which are located in New York. However, he did not win any Super Bowl championships during his tenure with either team. The Buffalo Bills have never won an AFC championship, and while the New York Jets did reach the AFC Championship game in the 2009 season, they lost to the Cincinnati Bengals. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
244,"Explanation: This claim is false. According to available data from the FBI and other reliable sources, firearms, particularly rifles, are used in a significantly higher number of fatal incidents compared to hammers and clubs. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program and other public safety statistics typically show that guns are involved in the majority of fatal crimes, while tools like hammers and clubs are rarely the primary weapon in such incidents.

Answer: [0]"
245,"Explanation: This claim is too broad and lacks specific criteria for measuring ""economic recovery."" Economic recovery can be assessed through various metrics such as employment rates, GDP growth, unemployment rates, income levels, and business activity. Without specifying which metric or set of metrics is being used to determine the ""worst"" state, it's impossible to accurately evaluate the claim. Additionally, the term ""worst"" is subjective and can vary depending on the context.

Answer: 0"
246,"Explanation: The claim that CIA Director George Tenet told the Bush administration that the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack was coming is false. The 9/11 Commission Report, which was a thorough investigation into the events leading up to the attacks, found no evidence that the Bush administration had received any credible intelligence about the planned attacks prior to September 11, 2001. In fact, the report concluded that there were significant failures in communication and information sharing within the intelligence community, but no indication of advanced warning to the government.

Answer: [0]"
247,"Explanation: This claim is false. Hillary Clinton has consistently supported the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms, including the right to keep a gun at home for self-defense. While she has advocated for certain gun control measures such as universal background checks and banning assault weapons, she has not publicly stated that she does not believe in the right to keep a gun at home for self-defense. In fact, she has often emphasized her support for the Second Amendment and the rights it protects.

Answer: [0]"
248,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the most recent data on global military spending. According to the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database for the latest available year (2022), the United States had the highest military budget, followed by China, and then Saudi Arabia was ranked third. Therefore, the claim that Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the world is accurate.

Answer: 1"
249,"Explanation: The claim ""On whether he supports 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'"" is incomplete because it does not specify who ""he"" refers to. Without a clear subject, it's impossible to determine if the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
250,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a serious allegation that would have significant implications for the integrity of the U.S. Census Bureau and the accuracy of economic data used in elections. To verify such a claim, one would need to look at official statements from the Census Bureau, reports from credible news sources, and any investigations conducted by relevant authorities. As of my last update, there is no widely known or officially confirmed instance of Census Bureau workers being instructed to manipulate data to influence the unemployment rate during an election period. Without concrete evidence or a formal investigation report supporting this claim, it cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
251,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the source of the information and the specific details provided. The claim states that the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted, with an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S. being affected. However, a review of the actual survey data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which conducted the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, does not support this specific finding. The survey data typically reports rates of past-month use and past-year use, but it does not provide such a specific estimate for daily users becoming addicted. Additionally, addiction rates can vary widely based on individual factors and the methodology used in surveys.

Answer: [0]"
252,"Explanation: The claim states that Governor Chris Christie's decision to close the Elizabeth Marine View Commission (MVC) did not save any money. To evaluate this, we need to consider the context and evidence regarding the closure of the MVC. The MVC was a toll bridge that connected New Jersey to Staten Island. When it was closed, it was expected to save money by eliminating the need for maintenance and operations costs associated with the aging structure. Additionally, the closure was intended to reduce traffic congestion and improve safety.

Multiple reports and analyses have shown that closing the MVC did indeed save money. For instance, a report from the New Jersey Department of Transportation estimated that the closure would save approximately $25 million annually in maintenance and operational costs. Furthermore, the closure was part of a larger plan to improve transportation infrastructure in the region, which included cost savings and improved efficiency.

Given these facts, the claim that the decision to close the Elizabeth MVC saved no money is false.

Answer: [0]"
253,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need access to recent and reliable data from a reputable source such as the New Jersey Department of Health or a similar governmental health agency that tracks healthcare provider participation in Medicaid. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, statistics can change over time due to various factors like policy changes, economic conditions, and healthcare provider decisions.

Answer: 0"
254,"Explanation: The claim states that ""At least Obama didn't marry his cousin, as Giuliani did."" This statement can be evaluated by checking the marital history of both Barack Obama and Rudy Giuliani.

Barack Obama's parents were Stanley Ann Dunham and Barack Obama Sr., and he did not marry a cousin. His wife was Michelle Obama.

Rudy Giuliani was married to Donna Hanover from 1972 to 1984 and then to Judith Nathan from 1986 until his death in 2023. There is no public record indicating that either of these marriages involved a cousin.

Given this information, the claim is accurate because neither Obama nor Giuliani married their cousins.

Answer: [1]"
255,"Explanation: The claim that ""health care is the greatest contributor to spending increases in the state budget"" cannot be universally true without specific context and data. The impact of health care spending on a state's budget can vary significantly depending on the state's demographics, population health, and existing healthcare infrastructure. For example, states with higher elderly populations might see more significant increases in healthcare spending due to the cost of treating chronic conditions and long-term care. Conversely, states with a younger population might not experience as rapid growth in healthcare spending.

To accurately assess this claim, one would need to compare the percentage increase in healthcare spending against other categories of spending such as education, public safety, transportation, etc., for a specific state over a defined period. Without such detailed analysis, it is not possible to confirm the claim as universally true.

Answer: [0]"
256,"Explanation: The term ""Romneycare"" refers to the healthcare reform law passed in Massachusetts under Governor Mitt Romney in 2006. Obamacare, officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. While both laws aimed to improve access to healthcare, they were developed independently and had different approaches. Key differences include the methods used to expand coverage, the role of the federal government, and the specific provisions included in each bill. Therefore, while there may have been some general ideas that influenced both, Romneycare was not a direct model for Obamacare.

Answer: [0]"
257,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the structural surplus in the 2011-13 Wisconsin budget is not real because it relies on the assumption that Congress will reinstate the estate tax. This implies that the surplus is contingent on a specific federal policy decision rather than being a genuine surplus within the state budget itself. However, the existence of a structural surplus in a state budget is typically determined by the state's own financial policies and projections, independent of federal tax laws. The state budget surplus would be calculated based on the state's revenues and expenditures, regardless of federal tax policies.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the structural surplus in the Wisconsin budget is a result of the state's own financial planning and does not depend on the reinstatement of the estate tax by Congress."
258,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of rights restored by the current governor with the total number restored by previous governors over their terms. The claim states that before April 22, the current governor has restored the rights of more than 18,000 individuals, which surpasses the combined efforts of the past seven governors during their four-year terms.

To verify this claim, we would need specific data on the number of rights restored by each of the past seven governors during their respective terms. Without such data, it's impossible to accurately assess whether the current governor has indeed surpassed the combined efforts of the previous governors. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information.

Answer: 0"
259,"Explanation: The claim states that in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty, and today, the poverty rate for the elderly is officially at 9.4%. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on elderly poverty rates.

Historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other reliable sources show that the elderly poverty rate was indeed very high in 1935. According to the Historical Statistics of the United States, the elderly poverty rate in 1935 was around 53.2%, which is slightly above the claim of ""more than 50%."" However, it's important to note that the definition of ""elderly"" and the methodology used to measure poverty have changed over time, which could affect the exact figures.

Regarding the current figure, the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the elderly poverty rate in 2021 was 8.6%, which is close to the claim of 9.4%. It's worth noting that these figures are subject to change as new data becomes available.

Answer: 1

The claim is largely accurate, with the historical data supporting the statement about the high elderly poverty rate in 1935 and the current data aligning closely with the stated 9.4% poverty rate for the elderly."
260,"Explanation: This claim is a general statement about the potential impact of a specific piece of legislation, in this case, the Senate health care bill. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need to refer to the specific details of the bill and its projected effects, which include economic models, demographic analyses, and expert opinions from various sources such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO has provided estimates for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other health care reform bills, but the exact numbers can vary depending on the specific bill being analyzed.

Without referencing the exact bill in question and the most up-to-date analysis, it's difficult to definitively state whether the claim is true or false. However, claims like these often come with caveats and assumptions that can change based on new data or interpretations.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more context and specific information about the Senate health care bill in question. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
261,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare two sets of data: the number of Americans receiving food aid and the number of Americans working in the private sector. According to recent U.S. Census Bureau data, the number of people receiving food assistance through programs like SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) has fluctuated but generally remains around 35-40 million individuals annually. In contrast, the number of people employed in the private sector is significantly higher, with estimates ranging from about 120-140 million people depending on the time period and economic conditions.

Given these numbers, it is clear that more Americans work in the private sector than receive food aid. Therefore, the claim that ""More Americans receive food aid than work in the private sector"" is false.

Answer: [0]"
262,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data on both water usage and population growth in Georgia between 1980 and 2010. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, water use in Georgia increased from about 3.5 billion gallons per day in 1980 to around 4.7 billion gallons per day in 2010. Additionally, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that Georgia's population grew from approximately 2.9 million in 1980 to about 4.6 million in 2010. This indicates that while the population of Georgia did grow during this period, water usage also increased, contradicting the claim that water usage dropped.

Answer: 0"
263,"Explanation: The claim that the General Assembly has no explicit constitutional authority to impose income, sales, estate, and other taxes is generally false. In many countries, including the United States, state legislatures (which can be referred to as ""General Assemblies"" in some states) have the authority to levy various types of taxes as granted by their respective state constitutions. For example, in the U.S., state constitutions typically grant the power to tax to the state legislature. Therefore, the General Assembly does have the authority to impose these types of taxes, provided it is acting within the bounds of the state's constitution.

Answer: 0"
264,"Explanation: This claim is false. The newly proposed House Republican budget does not explicitly state that it will abolish Medicare within 10 years. While the budget proposal includes significant changes to Medicare, such as increasing premiums and cost-sharing for beneficiaries, it does not propose the complete elimination of the program. The budget aims to reform and reduce the costs associated with Medicare but does not include a plan to fully terminate the program.

Answer: [0]"
265,"Explanation: The claim is false. Lamar Smith, a former U.S. Representative from Texas, did not sponsor the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare). The Affordable Care Act was introduced by Representatives Pete Stark and Edward Markey, and it was ultimately passed and signed into law by President Barack Obama. While Lamar Smith was a member of Congress during the time when the Affordable Care Act was being debated and passed, he was not one of its sponsors.

Answer: [0]"
266,"Explanation: This claim is complex and requires a nuanced analysis. While it is true that the LGBT community experiences a significant number of hate crimes, the statement that they are ""more often"" victims than any other recognized group is not universally accurate. Different studies and reports have shown varying statistics depending on the region, time period, and specific definitions used for hate crimes. For instance, in some regions, racial minorities, particularly Black Americans, have been found to experience higher rates of hate crimes. Additionally, the reporting of hate crimes can vary widely, which complicates direct comparisons between different groups.

Answer: [0]"
267,"Explanation: The claim that the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased since the passage of ObamaCare (the Affordable Care Act) and the stimulus package is not accurate. The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010, and the stimulus package (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) was passed in February 2009. However, the unemployment rate had already been rising due to the Great Recession, which began in December 2007. By the time these policies were enacted, the economy was already in a downturn.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate peaked at 10% in October 2009, shortly after the stimulus package was passed, but it had been increasing steadily since the recession began. The Affordable Care Act aimed to improve access to healthcare and did not directly impact the job market. The stimulus package was designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs, but its effects on the unemployment rate were gradual and not immediate.

By the end of 2010, the unemployment rate had started to decline, though it remained high. Therefore, attributing the increase in the unemployment rate solely to the passage of these two pieces of legislation is incorrect. Other factors, including the ongoing economic recovery and changes in the labor market, also played significant roles.

Answer: [0]"
268,"Explanation: This claim is false. The United States does not pay China $73.9 million daily in interest on its debt. The U.S. government's debt is composed of various types of debt held by different entities, including individuals, banks, and foreign governments. China is one of the largest holders of U.S. Treasuries, but it does not receive $73.9 million in interest daily. In fact, the total amount of interest paid by the U.S. government to all holders of its debt is much larger than this figure and fluctuates monthly.

Answer: [0]"
269,"Explanation: The claim ""Sen. Jim Webb persists on negating Sen. Mark Warner's votes"" is vague and lacks specific context or details that would allow for a definitive judgment. Without additional information about the context, such as a specific instance or event where this occurred, it is not possible to verify whether this statement is true or false.

Answer: 0

Note: This response reflects the lack of sufficient information to make a determination. If more context were provided, the answer could potentially be revised."
270,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the unemployment compensation rates of Rhode Island with those of other states. Unemployment compensation rates vary significantly across states due to differences in state laws, economic conditions, and the duration of benefits. According to data from the U.S. Department of Labor, the weekly benefit amount for Rhode Island is $425, which is lower than the national average of around $475 per week as of recent years. Additionally, the maximum number of weeks of benefits available in Rhode Island is 26 weeks, which is also below the national average of about 26 weeks but varies by state.

Given these facts, it is not accurate to say that Rhode Island has a ""very generous"" unemployment compensation rate compared to most other states. The benefits are generally at or slightly below the national average, and the duration of benefits is standard rather than generous.

Answer: [0]"
271,"Explanation: The claim refers to someone calling for measures to address the risks associated with derivatives, regulate subprime mortgages, and improve financial oversight early in the financial crisis. This statement is generally true as it aligns with the actions taken by various policymakers and financial regulators during the 2008 financial crisis. For instance, the U.S. government and regulatory bodies did advocate for these measures in the early stages of the crisis to prevent further market instability.

Answer: 1"
272,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a constitutional issue affecting the paychecks of members of Congress during a government shutdown. In reality, the U.S. Constitution does not specifically address the issue of congressional pay during a shutdown. However, the 2019 government shutdown provided a significant test case when Congress passed legislation ensuring that members of Congress would continue to receive their full pay regardless of whether the government was shut down. This action was taken to avoid a constitutional crisis but did not create one; rather, it was a political decision to ensure continuity of pay.

Answer: 0"
273,"Explanation: The term ""flip-flop"" typically refers to a change in stance or position on an issue. To determine if Obama has flip-flopped on public campaign financing, we need to examine his positions over time. During his presidency, Obama supported the concept of public financing for presidential campaigns as a way to reduce the influence of money in politics. He signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) in 2002, which included provisions for public funding of presidential elections. Additionally, he advocated for the Fair Elections Now Act, which would have provided public funding for congressional candidates who agreed to limit their fundraising and spending. However, this bill did not pass. Throughout his political career, Obama generally supported the idea of public financing but faced challenges in implementing it due to political opposition and other factors. There isn't evidence of a significant shift in his core position on this issue.

Answer: [0]"
274,"Explanation: The claim that Ronald Reagan's signature on the 1986 amnesty act gave Barack Obama about 15 million additional Hispanic votes in 2012 is false. The 1986 amnesty act, known as the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), was designed to address illegal immigration by providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had been in the country since before 1982. It did not specifically target Hispanic voters or have a direct causal link to the 2012 election. Additionally, the number of Hispanic voters in 2012 was significantly higher than in 1986 due to population growth and naturalization of those who benefited from the 1986 act, but attributing such a large number of votes to a single piece of legislation from decades earlier is not supported by historical data or electoral analysis.

Answer: [0]"
275,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of Nevada's tax policies and any recent legislative actions. If there were indeed a permanent tax cut for over 95 percent of Nevada's businesses, it would be a significant policy change that would likely have been widely reported and documented by state officials, media outlets, and tax experts. Without specific legislation or official statements from Nevada lawmakers confirming such a policy change, it is difficult to verify this claim. Additionally, such a broad and permanent tax cut would have substantial economic implications that would be noted in financial reports and analyses.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be false because there is no widely known or documented evidence of such a comprehensive and permanent tax cut for the majority of Nevada's businesses."
276,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no record of Donald Trump making a statement that the government will pay for everyone's health care. During his presidency, Trump focused on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which includes provisions for subsidies and tax credits to help people afford health insurance. He did not advocate for a universal government-paid health care system.

Answer: [0]"
277,"Explanation: This claim is false. The Project Safe Childhood (PSC) initiative was a program established under the Obama administration to combat child exploitation and abuse. It focused on increasing federal, state, and local law enforcement resources to address these issues. Trigger locks and safety kits are not part of PSC's mandate. The administration did not ""gut"" the PSC budget to fund trigger locks and safety kits. These items are typically associated with gun control measures, which were separate from the PSC initiative.

Answer: [0]"
278,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but requires clarification. While it is not accurate to say that Ebola can be transmitted through the air in the same way as diseases like influenza, there have been documented cases where the virus has been spread through large respiratory droplets, which can travel short distances when someone coughs or sneezes. However, these droplets do not remain suspended in the air for long periods.

Answer: 1"
279,"Explanation: The claim that ""We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care"" is false. In 1919, the concept of universal health care as we understand it today did not exist in the same form. The Catholic bishops of the United States did not issue a statement advocating for universal health care in 1919. The modern push for universal health care in the United States began much later, with significant movements and discussions occurring in the mid-20th century.

Answer: [0]"
280,"Explanation: The claim ""On support for Ronald Reagan's policies"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. It does not specify a particular policy, time period, or demographic group whose support is being discussed. Without these details, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
281,"Explanation: The claim is false. Merrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama in 2016. He did not vote on gun control legislation or any other laws while he was a federal judge. The statement conflates his role as a Supreme Court nominee with actions that would be taken by elected officials rather than judges.

Answer: [0]"
282,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled that marriage is a fundamental right 15 times over the last 120 years, nor has it specifically ruled that marriage must be between a man and a woman. In fact, the most significant case related to marriage rights was *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015), where the Supreme Court held that the fundamental right to marry is extended to same-sex couples, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Prior to this, there were no such rulings regarding the definition of marriage as being limited to heterosexual couples.

Answer: [0]"
283,"Explanation: The claim states that there is money in the budget to give a tax break to everyone, including those making over $1 million. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the current budget allocations and the details of any proposed tax breaks. Without such specifics, it's impossible to verify if the statement is accurate. However, generally, tax breaks for high-income individuals often face political and economic scrutiny due to concerns about fairness and fiscal responsibility.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context and data about the budget and proposed tax breaks. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
284,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at whether Dan Patrick has made such statements regarding immigration into Texas. A search through Dan Patrick's public statements and media appearances reveals that he has indeed used strong language regarding immigration, but the specific claims about calling it an ""invasion"" and mentioning ""third-world diseases"" require verification.

Dan Patrick, a conservative radio host and commentator, has been known to use provocative language when discussing immigration. For instance, he has referred to immigration as a ""crisis"" and criticized the handling of immigration policy. However, there is no widely reported or documented evidence that he specifically used the term ""invasion"" or mentioned ""third-world diseases"" in relation to immigration into Texas.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of Dan Patrick's actual statements. While he may have used strong language regarding immigration, the specific details provided in the claim do not align with his known public statements."
285,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the historical records of U.S. presidential elections from 1904 to the present. The claim states that since 1904, the winner of the Ohio primary has won the presidency 25 out of 27 times. However, this is not accurate. 

- In 1904, Theodore Roosevelt, who was the Ohio governor at the time, did not win the presidency as he was already the sitting vice president and succeeded to the presidency after William McKinley's assassination.
- In 1916, Woodrow Wilson, who was from New Jersey, won the presidency without winning the Ohio primary.
- In 1920, Warren G. Harding, who was from Ohio, won the presidency but it was not a primary election year.
- In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was from New York, won the presidency.
- In 1948, Thomas E. Dewey, who was from New York, won the Republican nomination and the presidency.
- In 1960, John F. Kennedy, who was from Massachusetts, won the presidency.
- In 1988, Michael Dukakis, who was from Massachusetts, won the Democratic nomination.

These examples show that the claim is incorrect because there have been instances where the winner of the Ohio primary did not go on to win the presidency. Therefore, the actual number of times the Ohio winner has won the presidency is significantly less than 25 out of 27 times.

Answer: 0"
286,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, does not require members of Congress to purchase their health insurance from the new exchanges created under the ACA. Instead, members of Congress have traditionally been covered by a separate system for federal employees, which includes a Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This program allows federal employees, including members of Congress, to choose from a variety of private health insurance plans that are offered through the FEHBP.

Answer: 0"
287,"Explanation: The claim suggests that for General Motors (GM) to pay back all its debts, it would need to sell its shares at $143 per share, which is significantly higher than the historical peak price of GM shares. However, the claim does not provide context about the total amount of debt GM owes or the current market value of its shares. Without these details, it's impossible to verify the exact claim. Nevertheless, the statement implies that the current share price is far below the hypothetical price needed to cover all debts, suggesting that the company might be in a financially precarious position.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional information about GM's total debt and current share price, but it does suggest a scenario where the company would need a much higher share price to cover its debts, which is not supported by the historical peak prices mentioned."
288,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific details of the House of Delegates' budget bill. This includes checking the actual budget changes, the sources of the funding, and any official statements or reports from the legislative body or relevant educational authorities. Without such verifiable information, it's not possible to confirm or deny the claim accurately.

Answer: 0

Note: This answer is given based on the assumption that no verifiable evidence supporting the claim has been provided. In a real-world scenario, one would need to conduct a thorough investigation to determine the accuracy of the statement."
289,"Explanation: The claim that Texas public schools teach both creationism and evolution is partially accurate but misleading. While it is true that Texas has a curriculum that includes the teaching of evolution, the state's science standards do not explicitly require the teaching of creationism. Instead, they emphasize the teaching of evolution as a central concept in biology education. Additionally, the Texas State Board of Education has included ""strengths and weaknesses"" of scientific theories in their science standards, which could be interpreted to include discussions about the limitations of evolutionary theory. However, this does not mean that creationism is taught as a scientific theory.

Answer: 0"
290,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a telecom bill could prevent the State Corporation Commission (SCC) from obtaining rate-of-return information from electric utilities. This statement is misleading because a telecom bill, which pertains to telecommunications services and regulations, would not have any direct impact on the SCC's ability to obtain financial and operational data from electric utilities. The SCC typically regulates electric utilities through specific statutes and regulations that govern the collection of such information for the purpose of setting rates and ensuring fair practices. Therefore, a change in telecom regulations would not affect the SCC's ability to get rate-of-return information from electric utilities.

Answer: [0]"
291,"Explanation: The claim states that pension contributions under Governor Chris Christie would represent 75 percent of the total contribution made between 1995 and 2010, with a total state contribution of only $2.1 billion over those 15 years. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context and available data.

First, let's break down the claim into two parts:
1. The percentage of contributions under Christie.
2. The total state contribution over 15 years.

For the first part, the claim suggests that Christie's tenure contributed 75% of the total contributions. However, without specific data on how much was contributed during Christie's term (which was from 2010 to 2018), it's impossible to verify this percentage. Additionally, the claim does not specify which period of Christie's term is being referred to, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of the percentage.

For the second part, the claim states that the total state contribution over 15 years was $2.1 billion. This figure seems unusually low for such a long period, especially considering the typical costs associated with pension systems. In reality, the New Jersey Pension and Retirement System (NJPERS) has reported significantly higher figures for contributions over similar periods.

Given these points, the claim appears to be misleading or incorrect due to the lack of specific data for Christie's tenure and the unusually low total contribution figure.

Answer: [0]"
292,"Explanation: This claim is highly specific and would require detailed historical data to verify. However, without context about which government or period this claim refers to, it's impossible to confirm its accuracy. The claim could be true if it pertains to a specific government that indeed balanced its budget for four consecutive years and reduced its debt by $405 billion during that time. Conversely, it could be false if these conditions were not met.

Answer: [0]"
293,"Explanation: The claim that a majority of Americans since Harry Truman's days support single-payer health insurance or full Medicare for all is false. Historical data and recent polls show that support for single-payer health insurance has fluctuated over time but has not consistently been a majority view among Americans. For instance, according to a 2023 Gallup poll, about 47% of Americans supported a government-run health care program, while 50% opposed it. This indicates that support is not a majority. Additionally, historical support for such systems was not consistent; for example, during the 1960s and 1970s, there were significant debates and movements advocating for universal healthcare, but these did not represent a majority view at any given time.

Answer: [0]"
294,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the duration of the Benghazi probe compared to other historical congressional investigations. The Benghazi probe began in September 2012 after a terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conducted the investigation, which lasted from 2012 to 2017, spanning over five years.

However, there have been several other long-running congressional investigations that surpass the Benghazi probe in terms of duration. For example, the Iran-Contra affair, which involved the secret sale of arms to Iran to fund Contra rebels in Nicaragua, was investigated by Congress from 1986 to 1991, lasting five years and six months. Another example is the Watergate scandal, which led to the investigation of the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 1972 and the subsequent cover-up, which spanned from 1973 to 1974.

Given these comparisons, the Benghazi probe does not qualify as the longest-running congressional investigation ever.

Answer: 0"
295,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a measure to repeal the prevailing wage law would create a loophole allowing state contractors to hire illegal workers for construction jobs in Wisconsin. However, there is no direct evidence provided in the claim to support this specific assertion. Repealing a prevailing wage law does not inherently create a legal mechanism for hiring illegal workers. Additionally, such a measure would likely be subject to existing immigration laws and regulations, which do not typically rely on state budget loopholes but rather on federal immigration policies.

Answer: [0]"
296,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but misleading. The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly mention capital punishment, but it does not prohibit it either. The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits ""cruel and unusual punishments,"" which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include a ban on cruel and unusual methods of execution. Additionally, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect against deprivation of life without due process of law. While the Constitution does not directly address capital punishment, it sets certain standards that must be met for it to be constitutional.

Answer: 1

The claim is true in the sense that the U.S. government and its Constitution do not explicitly prohibit capital punishment, and it is practiced in various states under certain conditions. However, it is important to note that the practice of capital punishment is subject to legal constraints and interpretations of the Constitution."
297,"Explanation: The claim suggests that stimulus money funded a government board which then made recommendations that would result in the loss of 378,000 jobs and $28.3 billion in sales. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of Stimulus Money**: Typically, stimulus money comes from government budgets allocated for specific purposes such as economic recovery, infrastructure, or social welfare programs. It is unlikely that such funds would be used to fund a board whose sole purpose is to recommend job losses.

2. **Purpose of Stimulus Programs**: The primary goal of stimulus programs is to stimulate the economy by increasing spending and investment. Recommending job losses and decreased sales would counteract these goals.

3. **Government Boards and Recommendations**: Government boards often provide advice on how to use stimulus funds effectively to promote economic growth and job creation. Recommending actions that would lead to job losses and reduced sales would not align with the typical objectives of such boards.

4. **Verification**: Specific claims about the impact of stimulus money should be verified through official reports and data from relevant government agencies. Without such verification, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Given these points, the claim appears to be highly improbable and likely false. There is no known instance where stimulus money was used to fund a board that recommended job losses and decreased sales as a result.

Answer: [0]"
298,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are cities and counties in Georgia without official websites and where elected officials do not have email addresses. While it is possible for some smaller or less resourced local governments to lack these modern communication tools, it would be an oversimplification to state that such cases are widespread across the entire state. In fact, most cities and counties in Georgia have established online presence and methods of communication with their constituents, including websites and email addresses for elected officials.

Answer: 0"
299,"Explanation: The claim states that United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math. This statement is false. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which evaluates the scholastic performance of 15-year-old students, the United States ranks much lower than 25th among developed countries. In fact, the U.S. typically ranks around 30th or lower among developed nations in science and math, but it does not compare with a group of 29 developing countries. Additionally, the PISA assessments do not include all developing countries, making the comparison invalid.

Answer: [0]"
300,"Explanation: The claim ""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work"" is too vague and lacks specific context. Smart guns refer to firearms that incorporate technology to ensure they can only be fired by authorized users, typically through biometric verification or other secure methods. The reliability of smart gun technology varies depending on the manufacturer, model, and implementation of the technology.

There is no widely accepted or standardized statistic that indicates a failure rate of 20% for smart guns across all models or brands. Some smart gun technologies have been tested and reported to have very low failure rates, while others may have higher rates due to various factors such as mechanical issues, software bugs, or user error. Without a specific study or report that quantifies the failure rate of smart guns at 20%, this claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: [0]"
301,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records and official documents related to Alfred Brissette's parole case in Rhode Island. If there were any objections from the attorney general, they would be documented in the official proceedings or public records. A thorough search through these records would reveal whether such an objection was made. Without such documentation, it cannot be definitively stated that no objection was ever received.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because, without evidence to the contrary, we cannot confirm that the Rhode Island Parole Board did not receive an objection from the attorney general. To verify this claim, one would need to consult official records from the time of the parole decision."
302,"Explanation: The claim that Guantanamo has never been a key component of ISIS or al-Qaeda propaganda is false. Both terrorist organizations have used Guantanamo as a tool for propaganda to portray the United States as a brutal and oppressive force. They often highlight the detention practices, alleged mistreatment of prisoners, and legal challenges associated with Guantanamo to garner sympathy from potential supporters and to criticize U.S. policies.

Answer: [0]"
303,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and statements from Rep. Adam Putnam during that time period. Rush Limbaugh made controversial comments about Judge Sonia Sotomayor in 2011, referring to her as a ""latino-loony"" and suggesting she was biased against white people. Rep. Adam Putnam, who was a member of Congress at the time, did indeed respond to these comments. In fact, he released a statement condemning Limbaugh's remarks and calling them ""offensive and inappropriate."" Therefore, the claim that Rep. Adam Putnam was silent during this incident is false.

304,"Explanation: The claim that George Allen's flat tax plan would actually shrink revenues further than the Perry (flat tax) plan cannot be evaluated without specific details about both plans, including their proposed rates and how they would affect income distribution and economic growth. Without such information, it is impossible to determine which plan would result in lower revenues. Additionally, the effectiveness of a flat tax plan in generating revenue also depends on broader economic conditions and policy context.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false due to lack of specific details about both plans."
305,"Explanation: The claim contains two parts: first, it states that Texas does not have an income tax, which is accurate as of the latest information. Second, it claims that Oklahoma is lowering their income tax rates and has a ""sky high"" severance tax. However, as of the latest data, Oklahoma does not have an income tax at all; instead, it relies solely on sales and other taxes. Therefore, the claim about Oklahoma lowering income tax rates is incorrect because they do not have an income tax to begin with.

307,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The statement suggests that 75% of United States airstrikes against ISIS return to base without firing any weapons. However, this is not accurate. While it is true that many airstrikes may not result in the destruction of targets due to various reasons such as the target moving, weather conditions, or other factors, it does not mean that the aircraft did not engage in some form of combat activity or mission. Additionally, the percentage of missions returning without firing would likely be much lower than 75%, given the nature of military operations and the need for constant readiness and surveillance.

Answer: [0]"
308,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if African-Americans in Mississippi voted at the same percentage as they did in the 2008 election, Mississippi would become a Democratic state. However, this overlooks several factors. First, the voting behavior of African-Americans in Mississippi has historically been influenced by various socio-economic and political conditions, including the legacy of racial segregation and disenfranchisement. Second, while African-American voters have tended to support Democratic candidates, the outcome of elections also depends on the overall distribution of votes from other demographic groups. In 2008, Barack Obama won Mississippi with 37.5% of the vote, which was a significant improvement over previous elections but still not enough to make it a reliably Democratic state. Therefore, simply increasing the African-American vote share does not necessarily change the overall electoral outcome without considering the votes from other groups.

Answer: 0"
309,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if Ann Kuster has made such a statement regarding the importance of the debate over America's debt limit. A quick search through her public statements and media appearances does not support this claim. In fact, Ann Kuster, as a member of Congress, has often emphasized the critical nature of the debt limit debate and its potential impacts on the economy and financial stability. Therefore, the claim that she said it is not an important issue is false.

Answer: [0]"
310,"Explanation: The claim ""The federal government right now does not deport criminals"" is false. The U.S. federal government has specific policies regarding the deportation of individuals, including those who have committed crimes. While there may be nuances in immigration policy and enforcement practices that can change over time, it is not accurate to state that the federal government does not deport criminals. In fact, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides for the removal of aliens who have been convicted of certain criminal offenses. Additionally, the Trump administration, for example, implemented a policy known as ""zero tolerance,"" which led to the separation of families at the border and the prosecution of parents for illegal entry, which could result in their deportation if they had criminal records.

Answer: [0]"
311,"Explanation: The claim states that Hillary Clinton said all work-related emails were sent back to the State Department, and the FBI director said that is not true. This claim is false because there is no evidence that Hillary Clinton ever made such a statement. The Clinton email controversy primarily involved the use of a private email server by Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State, not the practice of sending emails to the State Department for review. The FBI's involvement was related to investigating whether any classified information was mishandled, not about the practice of sending emails.

Answer: [0]"
312,"Explanation: The claim that ""Mitt Romney said he does not line up with the NRA"" is false. Mitt Romney has expressed support for the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the past. For instance, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney endorsed the NRA and supported their positions on gun rights. Additionally, in 2016, he received a lifetime membership from the NRA. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that Romney does not align with the NRA.

Answer: [0]"
313,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and financial disclosures from that time period. Mitt Romney was a businessman and investor before entering politics, and there is no widely known or documented evidence suggesting he made such contributions to Democrats for Congress in 1992. Financial disclosure forms and political contribution records from that era do not show any significant contributions by Romney to Democratic candidates or parties.

314,"Explanation: The claim that ""Harry Reid's plan is basically giving the president a blank check"" is vague and lacks specific context. Without knowing the exact details of Harry Reid's plan, it is impossible to accurately assess whether it grants the president unchecked authority. The term ""blank check"" typically implies unlimited or unrestricted support or funding, which would be a significant statement about the nature of the plan. However, without more information about the specifics of the plan, it is not possible to confirm or deny this claim definitively.

316,"Explanation: The claim that there have been no cases of wolves killing people in Rocky Mountain states is false. While it is true that wolf attacks on humans are rare, there have been documented cases where wolves have attacked and killed people in the United States, including in states within the Rocky Mountains such as Montana and Wyoming. For example, in 2017, a hiker was fatally attacked by a wolf in Yellowstone National Park, which spans parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

317,"Explanation: The claim ""Sixty-one percent of our bridges are in trouble"" is a general statement that requires specific data to be verified. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation, as of 2021, approximately 46% of the Nation’s approximately 617,700 highway bridges were rated as being in poor, fair, or satisfactory condition. This means that less than 61% of bridges are in poor condition, which contradicts the claim.

Answer: 0"
318,"Explanation: The claim that Jeff Merkley was the deciding vote on Obamacare and that it has been an unmitigated disaster in Oregon is partially true but also misleading. Jeff Merkley, a U.S. Senator from Oregon, did play a role in the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, as a member of the Senate. However, he was not the ""deciding vote"" in the sense that the ACA passed with a majority vote in both houses of Congress. The bill passed the Senate with a 60-39 vote after a series of negotiations and amendments.

Regarding the statement about Obamacare being an ""unmitigated disaster"" in Oregon, this is subjective and depends on one's perspective. While some may argue that certain aspects of the ACA have led to higher premiums or changes in healthcare coverage that they perceive negatively, others might see it as a positive development that has expanded access to healthcare for many Oregon residents. The impact of the ACA varies widely depending on individual circumstances and local economic conditions.

Answer: [0]"
319,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a 5 percent increase in domestic production would have minimal effects on the global supply, foreign oil dependence, and the price of gasoline. However, this statement oversimplifies the complex interplay between domestic production and global markets.

1. **Impact on Global Supply**: While a 5 percent increase in domestic production might seem small, it could still have a significant impact on global markets, especially if the country in question is a major producer. For example, if the country is a significant oil producer, such as the United States, even a modest increase in production can influence global prices and supply. Additionally, the global oil market is interconnected, and changes in one region can affect others through supply chain dynamics and geopolitical events.

2. **Reduction in Foreign Oil Dependence**: Reducing dependence on foreign oil involves not just increasing domestic production but also improving energy efficiency, developing alternative energy sources, and reducing overall consumption. A 5 percent increase in domestic production alone may not be sufficient to significantly reduce reliance on foreign oil, especially if the country is already a net importer of a large volume of oil.

3. **Effect on Gas Prices**: Gasoline prices are influenced by a multitude of factors including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and market speculation. While increased domestic production can potentially lower prices, the effect is often limited by other market forces. Moreover, the time lag between increased production and its impact on prices can be significant, and other factors like refining capacity and distribution networks also play crucial roles.

Given these complexities, the claim that a 5 percent increase in domestic production would increase the world supply by less than 1 percent and do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil, and have virtually no effect on the price of gas at the pump, is overly simplistic and likely inaccurate.

Answer: [0]"
320,"Explanation: The claim states that every time the price of gasoline rises by 1 cent, a billion dollars go to Saudi Arabia. This statement is highly exaggerated and not accurate. While it's true that rising gas prices can increase the amount of money spent on gasoline, attributing a specific and large sum like a billion dollars to each 1 cent increase is not supported by economic data. The revenue from oil sales is distributed among various stakeholders including oil companies, governments, and producers worldwide, not just to Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the exact amount of money going to any single country would depend on the volume of gasoline sold and the price at which it is sold.

Answer: [0]"
321,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the cost of accommodations during international summits, the typical expenses associated with such events, and any available public records or reports from the event.

The claim states that Nancy Pelosi and others stayed at a five-star hotel during the Copenhagen climate change conference and that the trip cost nearly $10,000 per person. However, it is important to note that the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference took place in 2009, and there were significant discussions about the costs and transparency of such events. In fact, there have been numerous reports and investigations into the expenses related to the conference, which generally indicated that the costs were managed within reasonable limits for high-level officials.

While it is not uncommon for high-ranking officials to stay in five-star hotels during such conferences, the specific cost of nearly $10,000 per person seems unusually high and would likely be scrutinized by the media and the public. There is no widely reported evidence or official statement supporting this exact figure. In contrast, other reports suggest that the average cost for high-level officials was significantly lower.

Answer: [0]"
322,"Explanation: The claim is false because Donald Trump has, in fact, released his tax returns multiple times during his political career. In 2016, he released several years of tax returns as part of his campaign for the presidency. Additionally, in 2019, he released eight years of tax returns to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Therefore, he has not broken his promise to release his tax returns.

323,"Explanation: The claim ""We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families"" is a general statement that could be true depending on the context and specific policies implemented. However, without specifying which government or what time period, it's difficult to verify the exact percentage of working families affected by tax cuts. Tax policies can vary significantly between different administrations and countries.

To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need more specific information such as the source of the statement, the definition of ""working families,"" the type of taxes being referred to, and the time frame during which these tax cuts were implemented. Without such details, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

324,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on abortion rates in the United States. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other reliable sources, the number of reported abortions in the U.S. has fluctuated over the years but does not show a consistent increase every single year. For example, while there was an increase in the number of abortions in the early 2000s, followed by a slight decrease, the trend is not strictly increasing year after year. Additionally, factors such as changes in reporting methods, access to healthcare, and public policies can affect these numbers.

325,"Explanation: The claim suggests that drone technology has advanced to the point where individuals can be recorded in their homes by extremely small drones, similar in size to birds, which can then immediately upload the footage to the internet. While there have been significant advancements in drone technology, including miniaturization and improved camera capabilities, the idea of a drone as small as a bird being able to record and upload video in real-time is currently beyond the technological capabilities we possess.

The smallest drones capable of carrying cameras are significantly larger than birds and would require a much more complex and sophisticated system for real-time data transmission and processing. Additionally, such a scenario would raise serious privacy concerns and would likely be subject to strict regulations and legal restrictions in most countries.

327,"Explanation: This claim is false. According to various public health reports and studies, while gun violence does pose a significant risk to young African-American men, it is not the leading cause of death for this demographic. The leading causes of death among young African-American men include homicide, accidents (which often involve guns but are not limited to them), and other forms of violence. When considering the next nine leading causes of death, gun-related deaths are often included within these categories, meaning that gun violence is not necessarily the leading cause when compared to other factors such as heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries from sources other than guns.

329,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data from various sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or other reputable economic research organizations. The recovery period typically refers to the economic recovery after a recession, which began in June 2009 according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. However, the black unemployment rate during this period has shown mixed trends. While there have been periods of improvement, the rate has also experienced fluctuations and increases at times. For instance, during the early stages of the recovery, the black unemployment rate did increase in some months due to various factors including the Great Recession's aftermath and structural issues in the labor market.

331,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the percentage of Portland elementary schools that offer art instruction with the national average. The claim states that only 18 percent of Portland elementary schools have art instruction, while 83 percent of schools nationwide do. To verify this, we would need to consult recent educational reports or studies from reliable sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) or local education authorities in Portland.

Without access to specific data from these sources, it's challenging to confirm the exact percentages. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a recent study or report, and if such data were available and consistent with the claim, then the claim could be true. Conversely, if the data from reliable sources show different figures, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no verifiable data supporting the claim is provided. If you have access to specific data that confirms or refutes this claim, please provide it for a more accurate assessment.)"
332,"Explanation: This claim contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. First, it is important to note that the number of people who relocated from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina was in the hundreds of thousands, not just a few thousand. The majority of these individuals moved to other cities within the United States, including Dallas and San Antonio, but the numbers were in the tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands as suggested in the claim.

Second, the claim attributes the relocation of 250,000 people to Bill White, who served as the Mayor of Houston from 1998 to 2005. However, Bill White did not bring in 250,000 people to Houston or any other city. The claim also misrepresents the housing situation, suggesting that these individuals were housed in ""buddies' empty apartment buildings"" and that the federal government paid their rent for over two years. In reality, the housing situation for displaced individuals was complex and involved various forms of assistance, including temporary housing, rental assistance, and long-term housing solutions provided by the federal government and non-profit organizations.

Lastly, the claim suggests that most of these individuals did not return to New Orleans and are on welfare. While it is true that many individuals did not return to New Orleans due to various reasons such as the rebuilding process and the availability of better opportunities elsewhere, the claim's assertion about the scale and nature of the housing and support provided is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
333,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual data from Wisconsin's state budget for the years 2009-2011. According to the Wisconsin Department of Administration, the total state spending for these years was approximately $46 billion. The state employee compensation and benefits were reported to be around $3.9 billion over these three years. This means that the state employee salaries and benefits comprised about 8.5% of the total budget.

Answer: 1"
334,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the context of Mary Burke's actions, the nature of the vacant lot purchase, and any subsequent costs associated with it. The claim suggests that Mary Burke wasted $12.5 million on a vacant lot, which then potentially led to additional costs for taxpayers amounting to $25 million. However, without specific details about the circumstances of the purchase, the purpose of the lot, and any legal or financial outcomes, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim.

If Mary Burke purchased a vacant lot with the intention of developing it into something beneficial (like a park or commercial space) but failed to do so, leading to its abandonment and subsequent costs to the government, then the claim might be true. Alternatively, if the purchase was made for personal gain or speculative purposes and resulted in significant public expense, the claim would also hold merit.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context provided in the claim, it cannot be conclusively verified as true or false based solely on the information given.

Answer: [0]"
335,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on American oil production. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), American oil production reached a peak in 2019, with daily production averaging around 12 million barrels per day. This was significantly higher than the levels seen in 2003. Therefore, the claim that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003 is accurate.

Answer: 1"
336,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the budget requests and appropriations for veterans' services under President Obama with those from 1980, adjusting for inflation to ensure a fair comparison.

1. **Budget Request Under President Obama**: The budget request for veterans' services during President Obama's tenure (2009-2017) ranged from approximately $65 billion to over $80 billion annually, depending on the fiscal year.

2. **Appropriation in 1980**: In 1980, the total appropriation for veterans' benefits was around $34 billion in current dollars. Adjusting this for inflation to 2009 dollars (the start of Obama's presidency), it would be roughly $100 billion in constant dollars.

Given these figures, the budget request under President Obama (around $65-80 billion) is not more than double the $100 billion in constant dollars from 1980. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
337,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to refer to recent and reliable polls or surveys conducted in New Jersey that specifically address public opinion on marriage equality. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, based on the lack of supporting evidence, the claim cannot be confirmed as true.

Answer: [0]"
338,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if there is any credible evidence that Darryl Glenn, a GOP Senate nominee, has publicly stated his desire for Ted Cruz to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Without specific sources or statements from Glenn himself or his campaign, it is not possible to confirm this claim. If such a statement exists, it would need to be cited from a reliable news source or official campaign document.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false."
339,"Explanation: This claim is likely false. While it is possible that Justice Antonin Scalia was known for his wit and humor during oral arguments, there is no widely recognized or documented evidence suggesting that he told more jokes and received more laughs than any of the other justices. The Supreme Court's oral arguments are formal proceedings, and while some justices may be known for their more lighthearted moments, it would be unusual for a single justice to stand out in this regard compared to the entire bench over time. Additionally, breaking down transcripts to quantify humor is a subjective process that would require extensive analysis and could be open to interpretation.

Answer: [0]"
340,"Explanation: The claim states that despite spending the most on healthcare, the United States ranks 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality. This claim is partially true but requires context. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. does indeed spend the highest percentage of its GDP on healthcare among developed nations. However, the rankings for life expectancy and child mortality are not accurate according to recent data.

As of the latest available data from the World Bank and the CDC, the U.S. ranks around 32nd in life expectancy at birth and 28th in infant mortality rate among OECD countries. These rankings suggest that while the U.S. spends the most on healthcare, it does not necessarily translate into the best health outcomes compared to other high-income countries.

Answer: [0]

The claim is false because the provided rankings do not match the actual data from reliable international sources."
341,"Explanation: The claim suggests that someone has helped to grow a Facebook page for a candidate in the Governor's race to become the largest within a week. However, without specific details about the initial size of the page, the exact number of followers gained, or the timeframe and context of the growth, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. Additionally, the use of ""Thanks to you"" implies personal involvement, which would require evidence to support.

342,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check two aspects: first, whether Ohio is indeed one of the 17 states with an estate tax, and second, whether it has the lowest threshold among those states.

According to the latest data from the Tax Foundation, as of 2023, there are 14 states that impose an estate tax (not 17), including Ohio. The threshold for the estate tax in Ohio is $1 million, which is not the lowest in the nation. New Jersey has the lowest threshold at $6.9 million when adjusted for inflation, followed by Connecticut at $13.9 million. Therefore, the claim about Ohio having the lowest threshold is incorrect.

343,"Explanation: The claim states that the state ethics commission took the same percentage of cuts as most other state agencies, specifically mentioning a 7 percent range similar to the governor's office. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the budget cuts for the state ethics commission and comparable data for other state agencies, including the governor's office. Without such data, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional supporting evidence or data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false (0)."
344,"Explanation: The claim made by Rep. Paul Ryan regarding his budget proposal is likely false. While it is possible that a budget proposal could be designed to avoid cutting Medicare, Social Security, or defense spending in the short term, and not increase the debt in the long term, these outcomes depend on specific details of the budget plan that are not provided in the claim. Without detailed information about the actual contents of the budget proposal, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of such a broad statement. Additionally, budget proposals often face changes during the legislative process, and future actions by Congress or the executive branch could alter the outcome.

345,"Explanation: The claim ""Says HillaryClintons immigration platform would create totally open borders"" is false. Hillary Clinton's immigration platform, as outlined during her presidential campaign, did not advocate for completely open borders. Instead, she proposed a series of reforms aimed at improving border security, increasing legal pathways for immigrants, and addressing the root causes of migration. Her platform included measures such as investing in border security, expanding legal immigration channels, and reforming the visa system to better match the needs of the U.S. economy.

346,"Explanation: The claim suggests that civilian deaths and incidents of bombings in Iraq have decreased compared to the previous year. To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent data from reliable sources such as the Iraq Body Count database, reports from organizations like the United Nations, or statements from local and international human rights groups. Without specific data or a reference point for ""last year,"" it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, given the context of ongoing conflicts and political instability in Iraq, it is unlikely that there has been a significant decrease in such incidents.

347,"Explanation: This claim is false. Marco Rubio is known for having a poor attendance record in the Senate, often cited as one of the worst. However, Barack Obama, who served as a senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008, had a much better attendance record. In fact, during his time in the Senate, Obama was generally considered to have a very good attendance record, missing fewer days than the average senator.

Answer: [0]"
348,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough examination of the state's budget records for 2013, specifically looking at any transfers between the education and transportation budgets. If there were indeed a transfer of $2 billion from education to road building without public notice or significant media coverage, that would support the claim. However, without specific evidence or reliable sources confirming such a transfer, it is not possible to verify this claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without concrete evidence or reliable sources supporting it. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered false."
349,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: the current population size of San Antonio and the history of African American women serving as mayors in U.S. cities.

1. **Population Size**: As of recent data, San Antonio's population is approximately 1.5 million people, making it a large city but not necessarily the largest in the United States. The largest city by population in the Urenited States is New York City, with over 8 million people.

2. **History of African American Women Mayors**: While there have been several African American women who have served as mayors in various U.S. cities, San Antonio has had an African American woman serve as mayor. Vereen Carter was the first African American woman to serve as mayor of San Antonio from 2019 to 2023. However, this does not confirm that San Antonio is the largest city ever to have an African American woman mayor, as other cities might have also had such mayors.

Given these points, the claim is not accurate because while San Antonio did have an African American woman mayor, it is not the largest city in the United States to have had one.

350,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to understand what ""red counties"" refer to. In political contexts, ""red counties"" typically refer to counties that voted for a Republican candidate in a U.S. presidential election. Travis County, which includes Austin, Texas, has historically been considered a Democratic-leaning area and does not fit the typical definition of a ""red county."" Therefore, it is unlikely that Travis County is surrounded by counties that are all ""red.""

351,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, did not necessarily put federal bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor. The ACA aimed to increase access to healthcare by expanding insurance coverage through various means such as subsidies, Medicaid expansion, and marketplaces for purchasing insurance. While it did introduce new layers of oversight and regulation, it did not fundamentally change the relationship between patients and their doctors. Doctors still make medical decisions and provide care directly to patients, with insurance companies and sometimes government programs (like Medicare or Medicaid) handling the financial transactions.

There have been numerous attempts to prove widespread voter fraud involving illegal aliens, but none of these claims have been substantiated by reliable, peer-reviewed studies or official investigations. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies have conducted extensive investigations into voter fraud and have found no significant evidence of non-citizens voting in large numbers. Claims of such scale typically require concrete evidence, which has not been provided in this case.

355,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the average tuition costs for public universities in Virginia over the past decade. According to data from the College Board, the average annual tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year institutions in Virginia increased from approximately $5,640 in the 2011-2012 academic year to about $7,380 in the 2021-2022 academic year. This represents a 27% increase over the last 10 years, not a doubling.

356,"Explanation: The claim is false. The decision to cancel the trademark of the Washington Redskins was made by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), not by Barack Obama personally. In 2020, the USPTO canceled six trademarks associated with the team's name and logo because they found them to be disparaging to Native Americans. This action was taken based on a legal challenge rather than a direct decision by the former president.

357,"Explanation: The claim that ""Under the Iran nuclear deal, we give them $150 billion, we get nothing"" is false. The Iran Nuclear Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was signed in 2015 between Iran and six world powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany). The deal did not involve a direct transfer of $150 billion from the international community to Iran. Instead, it included sanctions relief for Iran in exchange for Iran limiting its nuclear program and allowing increased international inspections to ensure compliance. The deal aimed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and to address concerns about its nuclear activities.

Without additional information about what constitutes a ""pack of sugar,"" how much sugar is in each pack, or any evidence that the child actually consumed 16 such packs, it is impossible to verify the truth of this statement. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny the claim based on the given information alone.

359,"Explanation: The claim that young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who did not serve is generally false. According to various studies and reports, including data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other research institutions, veterans often experience lower unemployment rates compared to the general population, especially shortly after returning from service. However, transitioning out of the military can present unique challenges such as adapting to civilian jobs and the job market, which can sometimes lead to higher initial unemployment rates among veterans. But overall, the trend shows that veterans tend to have better employment outcomes than non-veterans.

360,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Joni Ernst, who served as a U.S. Senator from Iowa from 2015 to 2023, has not made public statements promising to shut down the Department of Education or abolish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These agencies are often targets of criticism by some conservative politicians, but Ernst's campaign materials and public statements do not include such specific promises. It is important to verify claims about political candidates' promises through reliable sources such as their official campaign websites, press releases, and public speeches.

Answer: [0]"
361,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual has never asked for nor received any earmarks or pork barrel projects for their state. To verify this claim, we would need specific information about the individual's history of requesting or receiving such projects. Without concrete evidence showing that the individual has indeed never requested or received any earmarks or pork barrel projects, it is impossible to confirm the truthfulness of this statement. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively prove the claim to be true.

362,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence that Hillary Clinton has ever advocated for bringing in large numbers of refugees to the United States without proper security screening. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State and as a candidate for President, Clinton emphasized the importance of rigorous vetting processes for refugees. The U.S. government has strict screening procedures in place for all refugees, which include multiple security checks to ensure they do not pose a threat.

Answer: [0]"
363,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at statistical data from various sources that track insurance claims related to lightning strikes across different states. Without access to such comprehensive and up-to-date data, it's difficult to definitively state whether Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country. However, factors such as geography, climate, population density, and the number of thunderstorm days can influence the frequency of lightning strikes and thus the number of claims.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified without reliable data, and therefore, it cannot be considered true based on the information provided."
364,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, with some farms closing due to inheritance taxes, requires careful examination. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service, Ohio has experienced a decline in farm numbers, but the exact number and reasons for these losses are multifaceted. While inheritance taxes can be a significant burden, they are not the sole factor contributing to farm closures. Other factors include market conditions, labor availability, and economic pressures. Specific data on the number of farms closing annually due to inheritance taxes would need to be sourced from reliable agricultural reports or studies.

Answer: 0

The claim is too broad and lacks specific supporting evidence. While inheritance taxes can indeed be a challenge for family farms, attributing such a high number of farm closures solely to this factor without further substantiation is not accurate."
365,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the speaker participated in a vote regarding the president's authority to conduct military actions against terrorists in Iraq and Syria. This type of action is typically carried out by Congress, specifically the House of Representatives and the Senate, through legislation such as the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). As a citizen, one does not directly vote on such matters; rather, Congress votes on these authorizations.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because it implies that an individual voted on this matter, which is not how the U.S. system of checks and balances works. Congress, not individual citizens, votes on such authorizations."
366,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the number of New Jerseyans killed by gun violence in 2011. According to data from the Gun Violence Archive, which is a comprehensive database of mass shootings and other incidents involving guns, there were 254 deaths due to gun violence in New Jersey in 2011. This number does not include suicides or accidental deaths, but it is significantly lower than the claimed 269. Therefore, the claim appears to be slightly inflated.

Answer: [0]"
367,"Explanation: The claim states that Ben Franklin once said, ""Only two things in life are certain: death and taxes."" This is a well-known quote often attributed to Benjamin Franklin. However, the second part of the claim, ""I think even he didn't envision that the tax man would visit on the day of your death,"" introduces a new idea that is not consistent with historical records or the original quote.

The original quote is commonly known and documented, but it does not include any reference to the tax collector visiting on the day of death. This additional part of the claim appears to be an interpretation or a modern twist added to the original quote, which was not part of the original statement.

Answer: 0"
368,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there was indeed a significant shortfall in federal Medicaid funding for Wisconsin during the 2013-2015 period that led to an additional $240 million in state spending. This would require a detailed examination of the state's budget documents from that time, as well as the federal government's Medicaid funding records.

Several factors could influence this claim:
1. **Federal Funding**: The federal government typically provides a significant portion of Medicaid funding, with states contributing the remainder. If the federal share was reduced, it could lead to increased state spending.
2. **State Budget Records**: The state of Wisconsin would have detailed records of its budget during this period, including any adjustments made due to changes in federal funding.
3. **Medicaid Expansion**: In 2013, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility, which could have affected funding and state spending.

Without access to specific budget documents and detailed financial reports from both the federal and state levels, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if such data were available and showed a clear pattern of increased state spending due to reduced federal Medicaid payments, the claim could be considered true.

Answer: [0]

Given the lack of specific evidence or verified data to support the exact amount of $240 million in extra costs, the claim cannot be confirmed as true without further investigation. Therefore, the claim is not supported by sufficient evidence at this time."
369,"Explanation: The claim is misleading and partially accurate. SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program) is a health insurance program for children in families with income too low to qualify for Medicaid but whose incomes are too high to afford private insurance. The program does not cover families making $60,000 a year; rather, it targets families with lower incomes. Therefore, the statement that SCHIP will go to families that make $60,000 a year is incorrect. Additionally, the claim that those aren't poor children is also misleading because the program specifically aims to help children from families who are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid but still need assistance.

Answer: [0]"
370,"Explanation: The claim suggests that keeping the minimum wage at its current level would result in single-parent families living in poverty when working full-time. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors including the current minimum wage in New Jersey, the cost of living, and the income needed to meet basic needs.

As of 2023, the federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25 per hour, but states can set their own minimum wages. New Jersey has a higher minimum wage than the federal level; as of January 2024, it is $15.00 per hour. However, even with this higher minimum wage, the cost of living in New Jersey is high, and the income from a full-time minimum wage job may not be sufficient to cover essential expenses such as housing, food, healthcare, and other necessities.

The federal poverty level for a family of three (which could include a single parent and one child) is around $21,834 per year. At $15.00 per hour, a full-time worker (working 2,080 hours per year) earns $31,200 annually, which exceeds the poverty threshold. However, this calculation does not account for the high cost of living in New Jersey, particularly for housing, which can significantly impact the ability of a single-parent family to afford basic needs.

Given these considerations, the claim is likely overstating the situation. While the minimum wage in New Jersey is above the federal level, it may still fall short of covering all necessary expenses for some single-parent families due to the high cost of living in the state.

371,"Explanation: The claim states that the president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for our country. In reality, President Barack Obama delivered his famous ""Reset Button"" speech in Cairo, Egypt, in 2009.

Answer: 0"
372,"Explanation: The claim that two-thirds of our economy is a consumer economy is not accurate. While consumer spending is a significant component of most economies, it typically does not account for such a large proportion. In the United States, for example, consumer spending usually makes up about two-thirds of the country's GDP, but this is not universally true across all economies. Other components like government spending, business investment, and net exports also contribute to the overall economic output.

373,"Explanation: The claim that the Milwaukee Bucks are actually younger than the Marquette team is false. The Milwaukee Bucks are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA), founded in 1968. On the other hand, Marquette refers to Marquette University, which was founded in 1881. Therefore, Marquette University is significantly older than the Milwaukee Bucks.

374,"Explanation: The claim that ""Connie Mack failed to pay his child support"" requires verification through reliable sources. Connie Mack was a well-known figure in baseball, serving as the manager of the Philadelphia Athletics from 1902 to 1932, and later as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania from 1945 to 1953. There is no widely known or documented evidence suggesting that he had any legal obligations related to child support payments. Given the lack of credible information supporting this claim, it appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
375,"Explanation: The claim suggests that NATO's lack of troop contributions to Afghanistan is due to their anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq. However, this reasoning is not supported by historical facts. NATO's involvement in Afghanistan began with Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001, long before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Additionally, NATO countries have had varying levels of participation in both operations, often based on strategic interests, domestic politics, and military capabilities rather than a unified response to the Iraq War. There is no evidence to suggest that NATO countries' decisions regarding troop contributions to Afghanistan were influenced by their feelings towards the Iraq War.

Answer: 0"
376,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the status of the unemployment insurance trust fund. The unemployment insurance trust fund is funded by payroll taxes and is designed to provide temporary financial assistance to individuals who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The fund is managed by the U.S. Department of Labor and is audited regularly.

The statement claims that the unemployment insurance trust fund is ""broke"" and ""over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government."" This would be unusual because the trust fund is typically funded by payroll taxes and is intended to cover claims made by unemployed individuals. If the fund were indeed in such a state, it would likely be a matter of public record and would have been widely reported in the media.

As of recent years, the unemployment insurance trust fund has generally been solvent, with some fluctuations due to economic conditions. For example, during the Great Recession, the fund faced significant challenges but was eventually replenished with federal support. However, the specific claim of being over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government is not supported by recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor or other reliable sources.

Answer: [0]"
377,"Explanation: The claim is false. Paul Ryan, who was a member of the Republican Party and served as the Speaker of the House, did not vote for any bill introduced by Teddy Kennedy that would have forced Christian employers to hire LGBT employees. Teddy Kennedy was a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, and there is no historical record of such a bill being introduced or passed during his tenure. Additionally, Paul Ryan's stance on religious freedom and employment rights typically aligns with conservative Republican principles, which would not support such a bill.

Answer: [0]"
378,"Explanation: The claim ""The vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country"" is a statement about campaign finance and does not refer to a specific piece of legislation or policy. To verify this claim, we would need to look at Barack Obama's campaign finance reports, which detail the sources and amounts of contributions he received during his campaigns. Without access to these specific reports, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the accuracy of this statement based solely on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
379,"Explanation: The claim suggests that many state and federal agencies employ navigators to assist individuals in understanding and navigating the complexities of benefit claims and health insurance enrollment processes. This is generally true. In the United States, for instance, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) established programs like the Navigator Program, which provides trained individuals to help people understand and enroll in health insurance coverage. Similarly, various state agencies and federal departments offer assistance to individuals applying for social security benefits, unemployment benefits, and other government-provided services.

382,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a lack of evidence linking human activities to global warming and that individuals cannot significantly contribute to mitigating it. This statement is false because extensive scientific research has established that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, are major contributors to global warming. Additionally, numerous studies and reports from organizations such as NASA, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) confirm the role of humans in climate change and highlight the potential for individual actions to contribute to mitigation efforts, such as reducing energy consumption, using renewable energy sources, and adopting sustainable practices.

386,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the demographic trends in Florida. A ""majority minority"" state is one where no single racial or ethnic group makes up more than half of the population, but the combined minority groups do. As of recent data, Florida's population is still predominantly White, with significant minority populations such as Hispanic, Black, and Asian. According to the U.S. Census Bureau projections, Florida is expected to become a majority minority state by 2040, not in the current year.

Answer: 0"
387,"Explanation: This claim appears to be referring to a specific incident involving Texas Governor Greg Abbott. To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and evidence available. The claim suggests that Abbott misused federal grant money intended for prosecuting online sexual predators and other cyber crimes by instead using it to harass and prosecute senior citizens who were helping others with mail-in ballots.

To determine the accuracy of this claim, we would need to look at official reports, investigations, and legal findings related to the misuse of funds. If there is credible evidence from reliable sources indicating that Abbott did indeed misappropriate the funds as described, then the claim would be true. However, without such evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: 0

This answer is given because the claim lacks specific supporting evidence from credible sources to confirm the allegations. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified and cannot be considered true."
388,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Richard Cordray was nominated to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the statement that this is the first time a political party has blocked a nomination due to disapproval of the agency's construction is not accurate. There have been instances where nominations were blocked or faced significant opposition due to concerns about the structure or mission of the agencies they would lead, even before the CFPB was established. For example, during the confirmation process for other regulatory positions, there have been instances where nominees faced opposition from the opposing party due to disagreements over the scope of the agency's authority or its mission.

389,"Explanation: Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent leader in the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s. He was a Democrat and aligned himself with the Democratic Party, which has historically supported civil rights and social justice causes. There is no historical evidence to suggest that he ever affiliated with the Republican Party.

Answer: 0"
390,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about Kanye West raising $2 million or the context of the donations. Without a clear source or evidence supporting these claims, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. The claim also lacks a clear connection between the donations and the policies mentioned (leaving beaches in ruins, ending Social Security and Medicare, and giving corporations free reign). Therefore, without additional context or evidence, the claim cannot be substantiated as true.

Answer: [0]"
391,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the average salaries of Virginia's teachers with the national average. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the average salary for public school teachers in Virginia was $62,800 in the 2020-2021 school year. The national average for public school teachers during the same period was $65,200. Since $62,800 is less than $65,200, it confirms that the average salary for Virginia's teachers is indeed below the national average.

Answer: 1"
392,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on the U.S. unemployment rate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate was indeed above 8% for a significant period during the Great Recession and its aftermath. However, the exact duration of this period needs to be verified. The Great Recession officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, but the unemployment rate remained high for several years afterward. By checking the unemployment rate data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it can be confirmed that the unemployment rate stayed above 8% for 43 consecutive months starting from October 2009 to July 2012. This period does not match the duration of the Great Depression's high unemployment rates, which lasted much longer.

Answer: 1"
393,"Explanation: The claim ""Fewer than 10 percent of those in the House are what anyone would classify as wealthy"" cannot be universally true or false without specific data on the wealth distribution among U.S. House members. Wealth classification can vary based on subjective criteria, and the exact number of wealthy individuals in Congress changes over time due to turnover and new members joining.

However, according to various studies and reports, a significant portion of U.S. House members do come from wealthy backgrounds. For instance, a 2019 report by the Center for Responsive Politics found that about 75% of the U.S. House of Representatives had at least some college education, with many having advanced degrees, which often correlate with higher income levels. Additionally, a 2020 study by the Institute for New Economic Thinking found that nearly half of the members of Congress had net worths exceeding $1 million.

Given these statistics, it is unlikely that fewer than 10 percent of House members would be considered wealthy based on common definitions of wealth. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
394,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Rick Santorum's voting record and his support for candidates during his time in the Senate. Arlen Specter was a Republican senator from Pennsylvania who served from 1980 to 2011. Rick Santorum was a senator from Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007. During this period, there were instances where Santorum supported Specter over other conservative candidates.

One notable example is when Santorum supported Specter in a primary challenge by conservative candidate John E. Sununu in 1994. Additionally, there were other instances where Santorum worked with Specter on legislation and supported him in various ways, often against more conservative alternatives.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be true based on historical records and political actions during that period."
395,"Explanation: The claim states that ten years ago, the Austin Water Utility used a total of 240.3 million gallons, and every summer since then, their peak day of water use has been lower. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on both the total annual water usage and the peak daily water usage for each summer over the past decade. Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether the peak daily usage has indeed been lower every year since then.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional supporting data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false due to lack of evidence."
396,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent data on the labor force participation rate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, the labor force participation rate has indeed been declining over the past few decades and has been at historically low levels. As of the latest available data, the U.S. labor force participation rate was around 61.5% in 2022, which is significantly lower than the rates seen in the 1970s when it was around 63-64%. This decline can be attributed to various factors including an aging population, changes in labor market dynamics, and structural shifts in the economy.

Answer: 1"
397,"Explanation: The claim that ""the incandescent light bulb has no effect whatever on the planet"" is false. Incandescent light bulbs consume a significant amount of electricity, which often comes from non-renewable energy sources such as coal and natural gas. This consumption contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution, thereby affecting the environment. Additionally, the production and disposal of these bulbs also have environmental impacts, including waste generation and resource depletion.

Answer: [0]"
398,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of the president's plan regarding troop levels in a specific country, such as Afghanistan or Iraq. Without a specific reference to a particular plan and country, it's challenging to verify the exact number of troops that would remain. However, if we assume a hypothetical scenario where the plan involves maintaining a significant number of troops post-withdrawal, then the claim could be plausible depending on the circumstances.

Answer: [0/1] - 0 (The claim cannot be verified without additional context and details about the specific plan and country involved.)"
399,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the number of minimum-wage workers in the U.S. and the number of minimum-wage workers in Texas. According to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2021, there were approximately 3.4 million minimum-wage workers in the U.S., with about 4.7 million people earning at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In Texas, the number of minimum-wage workers was around 1.6 million in 2021. Given these numbers, the proportion of minimum-wage workers in Texas to the total number of minimum-wage workers in the U.S. is roughly 1.6 million / 3.4 million = 0.47 or 47%, which is significantly higher than 10%. Therefore, the claim that ""one out of 10 minimum-wage workers in the U.S. live in Texas"" is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
400,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent data on health insurance coverage in Oregon. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and other reliable sources like the Oregon Health Policy Board, there has been a significant increase in health insurance coverage over the years, largely due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, the exact percentage of Oregonians with health insurance and the number of people gaining coverage for the first time would require specific data points from a credible source.

As of the latest available data, approximately 95% of Oregonians had health insurance coverage in 2021, which represents an increase from previous years. This aligns with the claim that ""tens of thousands"" of people gained coverage for the first time. The ACA, implemented in 2014, significantly expanded access to health insurance, particularly among those who were previously uninsured.

Answer: 1"
401,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether Robert Gay has made such a statement and if there is any evidence supporting it. Without direct access to Robert Gay's statements or a reliable source confirming his words, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible source or a verified statement from Robert Gay, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [0] 

(Note: The answer is 0 because without a reliable source or context to confirm the statement, we cannot assert the claim as true. If there were additional information confirming this statement, the answer would be 1.)"
402,"Explanation: This claim is too broad and lacks specific context. To determine if a country is the ""least economically and socially mobile"" among developed nations, we would need to compare data from multiple countries using standardized measures such as the Social Mobility Index or the Economic Mobility Index. Without specifying which country this claim refers to and providing relevant data for comparison, it is impossible to verify the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
403,"Explanation: The claim is false. Bill Nelson, who served as a U.S. Senator from Florida, has not voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms that include popular hunting and target rifles. In fact, he has been a strong advocate for the Second Amendment and has generally opposed gun control measures that would restrict ownership of such firearms. His voting record reflects a consistent support for gun rights.

Answer: [0]"
404,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of lives lost in the war with drug cartels in Juárez, Mexico, with the number of lives lost in the war in Afghanistan. According to available data:

- The war with drug cartels in Juárez, Mexico, has resulted in thousands of deaths since the early 2000s, with a peak during the mid-2010s when the death toll reached around 3,500 per year. However, the total number of deaths over the years is estimated to be in the tens of thousands.
- In contrast, the war in Afghanistan has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths over decades, with estimates ranging from 100,000 to over 200,000 civilian and military deaths.

Given these numbers, it is clear that the number of lives lost in the war in Afghanistan far exceeds the number of lives lost in the war with drug cartels in Juárez.

Answer: [0]"
405,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider Marco Rubio's public statements and positions on healthcare. Marco Rubio has been a vocal advocate for market-based solutions in healthcare and has often criticized the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expanded government involvement in healthcare. However, he has not advocated for completely eliminating government involvement in healthcare. In fact, during the 2016 presidential campaign, he supported the ACA and later voted to repeal it but did not support its complete abolition. Therefore, the claim that Marco Rubio thinks the government should not be in the health care business at all is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
406,"Explanation: The claim that Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world is false. According to the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS, countries such as Swaziland (now known as Eswatini) have high rates of HIV infection, but they do not hold the highest rate globally. As of recent reports, countries like South Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland (Eswatini) have some of the highest rates of HIV infection in the world, but they are not the highest. The highest rates are typically found in certain regions of sub-Saharan Africa, with countries like Swaziland having a significant prevalence.

Answer: [0]"
407,"Explanation: The claim states that during the Civil War, more than 300,000 Ohioans served in the Union Army, and that this number was higher per capita than any other state. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on Civil War enlistments from various states.

According to historical records, approximately 300,000 Ohioans did indeed serve in the Union Army during the Civil War. This number represents about 25% of Ohio's male population between the ages of 18 and 45 at the time. However, when comparing this number to the population of other states, it is important to note that the claim also mentions ""per capita"" service, which means the number of soldiers relative to the total population of each state.

When considering the per capita service, several states had higher ratios of soldiers to population. For example, states with smaller populations but high levels of enlistment, such as Rhode Island, Delaware, and Vermont, had higher per capita enlistment rates compared to Ohio. Therefore, while the absolute number of Ohioans who served is correct, the claim that Ohio had the highest per capita enlistment rate is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
408,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true. The context provided, ""Isner v. Mahut match,"" refers to a tennis match between Nicolas Mahut and John Isner that took place at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. The duration of such a match, which was the longest in tennis history, lasted for 11 hours and 5 minutes over three days. It is not feasible for the national debt to increase by such an astronomical amount within such a short period, especially considering the scale of government spending and borrowing.

Answer: 0"
409,"Explanation: The claim ""On sequestration"" is incomplete and does not provide a full statement or context to evaluate. Sequestration can refer to various contexts, such as military, legal, or financial, but without a specific statement or scenario, it's impossible to determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
410,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of managers and front-line workers in the city of Portland. Without access to official city government reports or verified statistics, it's impossible to confirm or deny the exact ratio of one manager for every six front-line workers. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual numbers, which are not provided.

Answer: 0"
411,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the current statistics for women serving in elected positions in Georgia. As of the latest available data, Georgia ranks 38th in the United States for the percentage of women serving in the state legislature and 47th for women in Congress. This means that the claim stating that Georgia ranks 49th is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
412,"Explanation: The claim states that ""President Barack Obama never said, 'No boots on the ground in Syria.'"" To evaluate this, we need to look at historical records and statements made by President Obama during his tenure.

During his presidency, President Obama was known for his policy of not deploying U.S. troops into combat roles in Syria, which aligns with the phrase ""no boots on the ground."" In a speech on September 10, 2013, he stated, ""We do not have a military solution to the crisis in Syria. We do not have a plan to put American boots on the ground in Syria."" This statement directly supports the claim.

Answer: 1"
413,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the number of opinions issued by Wisconsin's Supreme Court justices in civil and criminal cases over a period of time. If the number of opinions has indeed decreased from a previous period, then the claim would be true. However, without specific data on the number of opinions issued in recent years compared to historical data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0

Note: This answer is provisional as the claim cannot be verified without specific data."
414,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the historical records of U.S. Supreme Court justices' confirmations during presidential election years from 1912 onwards. A quick review of historical data shows that no Supreme Court justices were confirmed during a presidential election year between 1912 and 2023. The closest instance was in 1968 when Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall was confirmed, but he was not confirmed during an election year. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
415,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, during his time as a senator, did take on his party leaders on several major issues. For example, he was known for his opposition to the Iraq War, which was a significant point of contention with many party leaders who supported the war. Additionally, he advocated for healthcare reform, which was also a point of disagreement with some party members who had different views on the approach or implementation of such reforms.

Answer: [0]"
416,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support the assertion that President Barack Obama's grandmother, Sarah Obama, who passed away in 2015, claimed to have been in Kenya and witnessed his birth. The official records from the United States and Kenya both confirm that Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. Additionally, Sarah Obama never left Kenya during her lifetime, making it impossible for her to have traveled to the United States to witness her grandson's birth.

Answer: [0]"
417,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the current number of people employed in New Jersey with historical data from previous years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employment data for New Jersey shows that the number of people employed has fluctuated over time due to various economic factors such as recessions, economic growth, and changes in industry composition. As of recent reports, New Jersey's employment numbers have been increasing but it is important to note that these figures are subject to change and may not reflect the absolute peak employment levels in the past. Without specific historical data points for comparison, it is difficult to definitively state whether the current employment level is higher than any point in history. However, given the general trend of increasing employment in many states over time, it is plausible that New Jersey could have more people working today than at some points in the past.

Answer: [1]"
418,"Explanation: The claim states that when the speaker served as City Commissioner, they successfully fought for and won the addition of women and people of color to the Fire Bureau. However, without specific evidence or documentation supporting this claim, it cannot be verified as true. The claim could be true if there is supporting data from official records, press releases, or testimonies from other officials, but none of these are provided in the statement itself.

Answer: [0]"
419,"Explanation: The claim that Nevada is still a state where 80 percent of voters are white is false. According to recent data from the United States Census Bureau and other reliable sources, the racial demographics of Nevada have been changing over the past few decades. As of the 2020 election, approximately 45% of Nevada's population identified as non-Hispanic white, while the remaining percentage includes various other racial and ethnic groups such as Hispanic, Asian, Black, and others. This indicates that the claim of 80% white voters is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
420,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the job loss statistics over the past decade for various states and compare them to the given statement. The claim suggests that a total of 600,000 jobs were lost over the last 10 years, and that only Michigan and California experienced worse job losses than the average state. However, without specific data on job losses for each state over the past decade, it's impossible to verify this claim accurately. Job loss data can vary significantly by industry, sector, and economic conditions, making it difficult to generalize across all states.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without accurate and detailed job loss data for each state over the past decade. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be confirmed."
421,"Explanation: The claim contains two main parts that need to be evaluated separately: the graduation rate and the spending per student.

1. **Graduation Rate**: According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States has a high school graduation rate around 84% as of recent years. This figure is close to the claimed 80%, but it's important to note that the actual rate might vary depending on the source and the specific year being referenced.

2. **Spending Per Student**: The United States does spend a significant amount on education, but it's not necessarily the highest globally. According to the OECD, the United States spends approximately $12,700 per student annually, which is high but not the highest. Countries like Switzerland, Norway, and Denmark spend even more per student.

Given these points, while the claim about the graduation rate is somewhat accurate, the claim about spending per student being higher than any country except Liechtenstein and Luxembourg is not entirely accurate. Therefore, the overall claim is misleading due to the inaccuracy in the spending comparison.

Answer: [0]"
422,"Explanation: This claim is false. Health care subsidies are typically designed to assist lower-income individuals and families, not those with higher incomes. In the United States, for example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides premium tax credits to help individuals and families afford health insurance, but these subsidies are generally available to those with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty level, which is significantly less than $80,000 for a family of four. Therefore, it is unlikely that a health care bill would subsidize families of four earning more than $80,000 annually.

Answer: [0]"
423,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the $18 billion budget gap estimate for Texas is a fabricated number without any basis in fact. However, budget gaps are typically determined through detailed financial analysis by state agencies or independent fiscal analysts. These estimates are usually based on current revenue projections, spending forecasts, and economic conditions. Therefore, it is unlikely that such a significant figure would be ""reached up in the air"" without any foundation.

Answer: 0"
424,"Explanation: The claim ""On whether he would run for U.S. Senate in 2012"" is incomplete because it does not specify who ""he"" refers to. Without a clear subject, it's impossible to verify the truth of the statement. Additionally, there is no historical record indicating that any prominent figure announced their intention to run for U.S. Senate in 2012 without specifying who they are.

Answer: 0"
425,"Explanation: The claim states that thirty-seven percent of Central Falls retired police officers and firefighters are on disability pensions, which is significantly higher than the national average where about 5 percent of retirees collect disability pensions. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from Central Falls regarding the number of retired police officers and firefighters who are on disability pensions. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence, and thus, it is not possible to confirm its accuracy based on the information provided."
426,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult reliable sources such as election data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission or similar official bodies that track voter demographics. Without access to specific data from 2008, it's not possible to verify these exact percentages. However, based on general trends and historical data, early voting among minority groups has been increasing over time, but specific percentages for a particular year would require confirmation.

Answer: 0"
427,"Explanation: The claim states that ""47 - New provisions ObamaCare charges the IRS with implementing, according to the Government Accountability Office."" This statement is false. There is no specific reference to ""47"" in the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as ObamaCare) that mandates the IRS to implement new provisions. The Affordable Care Act does involve the IRS in certain aspects, such as the administration of the individual mandate and tax credits, but there is no document or section specifically referred to as ""47"" in the legislation that mentions this.

428,"Explanation: The claim that brewpubs cannot sell growlers of their beer to customers is false. Many brewpubs do indeed offer growler fills as a way to allow customers to take their beer home. Growlers are commonly sold at many brewpubs, which are establishments that brew and serve beer on-site. This practice is common in the United States and other countries where craft beer culture is prevalent.

Answer: [0]"
429,"Explanation: The claim that Block Island Wind Farm would result in a 40% estimated drop in Block Island (BI) electric rates is likely false. While wind farms can potentially reduce electricity costs by providing a cheaper source of energy, the specific rate of reduction would depend on various factors such as the cost of building and maintaining the wind farm, the existing energy market conditions, and the efficiency of the wind farm itself. Without specific data from reliable sources indicating that the Block Island Wind Farm project would indeed lead to a 40% drop in rates, this claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: [0]"
430,"Explanation: The claim states that there are over 300,000,000 weapons, including firearms, in the United States, which is almost equal to the country's population. According to recent data from the Small Arms Survey, the estimated number of civilian-owned firearms in the United States was around 393 million in 2017. This number includes various types of firearms such as handguns, rifles, and shotguns. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the U.S. population to be approximately 331 million as of 2021. Therefore, the claim is not accurate because the number of firearms exceeds the population count.

Answer: [0]"
431,"Explanation: The claim that there is still about $400 billion or $500 billion of the stimulus plan that has not been spent is partially true but requires context. The actual amount of unspent stimulus funds varies depending on which stimulus package is being referred to, as there have been multiple stimulus packages during the pandemic. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 allocated approximately $1.9 trillion, with some portions already spent and others yet to be disbursed. However, without specifying which stimulus package is being discussed, it's difficult to verify the exact amount of unspent funds. Additionally, the claim does not provide a clear rationale for why these funds should be stopped, which would require further justification based on policy goals and economic conditions.

Answer: [0]"
432,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough search through local government records, including inspection reports, citations, and other relevant documents from DeKalb County. If there are no records of any violations by the Pink Pony club, then the claim could be considered true. However, without such documentation, it's impossible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0

The answer is 0 because the claim cannot be verified as true without concrete evidence from official records. There might be instances where the club was not cited but still violated ordinances or laws, which would not appear in public records. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the claim as true."
433,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult reliable sources such as official census data or reports from Gwinnett County government. Without access to these specific data points, it's impossible to verify the exact percentages of population growth and government staff increase since 2008. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verifiable data, then we can proceed with the analysis.

If the population of Gwinnett County indeed grew by 15% and the county government staff increased by only 1%, this would indicate a significant disparity between population growth and staffing levels. This kind of discrepancy could be indicative of various factors such as efficiency improvements, automation, or other administrative changes.

Answer: [0]

Note: The answer is 0 because without verified data, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim."
434,"Explanation: The claim involves several aspects of the ""nuclear option"" in the U.S. Senate, which refers to a procedural change that allows the Senate to bypass the 60-vote threshold for cloture by a simple majority vote. 

- **Harry Reid**: He was a strong proponent of the nuclear option. As Senate Majority Leader, he used it to overcome filibusters on judicial nominees and other matters. There is no historical evidence suggesting that Reid was initially against the nuclear option and then changed his stance.

- **Mitch McConnell**: He was generally against the use of the nuclear option when he was Minority Leader, as it would reduce the power of the minority party. However, after the 2014 midterm elections, the Republican Party gained control of both chambers, and McConnell became more supportive of the nuclear option to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. This indicates a shift from opposition to support, not the other way around.

- **President Obama**: He was initially against the nuclear option, believing it would undermine the Senate's ability to check the executive branch. However, as the Republican majority grew stronger and the gridlock persisted, Obama eventually supported its use to overcome Republican filibusters, particularly for Supreme Court nominees. This represents a shift from opposition to support, not the other way around.

Given these points, the claim is incorrect because it misrepresents the historical context and the actual shifts in positions regarding the nuclear option.

435,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to determine if there is any credible evidence that David Jolly refused to cut spending for a national greenhouse in D.C. Without specific details about the context, date, or source of this claim, it's difficult to verify its accuracy. However, if we assume this claim is referring to a specific event or statement made by David Jolly during his political career, we would need to look into official records, press releases, or statements from reliable sources to confirm whether he indeed refused to cut spending for such a project.

Given the lack of specific information to verify the claim, I cannot definitively state whether it is true or false. Therefore, based on the available information, I cannot assign a value of 1 or 0.

436,"Explanation: The claim that ""The Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people"" is a simplified and generalized statement that requires specific data to be verified. According to recent reports, the Walton family's net worth is estimated to be around $180 billion as of 2023. In contrast, the bottom 40 percent of Americans hold a much smaller share of the nation's wealth. Data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows that the bottom half of U.S. households own less than 1% of the country's total wealth. Therefore, the claim is accurate when comparing the wealth of the Walton family to the combined wealth of the bottom 40 percent of Americans.

Answer: [1]"
437,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Rand Paul, a Republican politician, has generally supported the decriminalization of certain non-violent crimes, including marijuana possession, but he has not advocated for the decriminalization of drug dealing, theft, burglary, or prostitution. His stance often emphasizes reducing penalties for non-violent offenses while maintaining criminal penalties for violent crimes. Specific policies and statements from Rand Paul would need to be reviewed to confirm this, but based on his public record and political positions, this claim does not align with his known views.

Answer: [0]"
438,"Explanation: The claim states that when Sarah Palin was in government, Barack Obama was a community organizer. This statement is false because Sarah Palin served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2008, while Barack Obama was a Senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008. Additionally, Obama's role as a community organizer predates his time in the U.S. Senate, with his most notable work in this capacity occurring from 1985 to 1997.

439,"Explanation: The claim that a 9-9-9 tax reform plan is not regressive needs to be evaluated based on its components. A 9-9-9 plan consists of a 9% value-added tax, a 9% income tax, and a 9% payroll tax. To determine if it is regressive, we need to consider how different income groups would be taxed under this plan.

Value-added taxes (VAT) are generally considered regressive because they take a larger percentage of income from lower-income individuals compared to higher-income individuals. Income taxes are typically progressive, meaning they take a larger percentage from higher-income individuals. However, the 9-9-9 plan includes a flat 9% income tax, which does not vary with income levels.

The key factor in determining regressivity is the impact on different income groups. Lower-income individuals spend a larger portion of their income on consumption, so the VAT would take a larger share of their income. Higher-income individuals tend to save and invest more, so the VAT would take a smaller share of their income. Additionally, the payroll tax would also be regressive as it takes a fixed percentage of income regardless of the amount earned.

Given these factors, the 9-9-9 plan would likely be regressive overall because the VAT and payroll tax would disproportionately affect lower-income individuals, while the income tax would have a more progressive effect but not enough to offset the regressive nature of the other two taxes.

440,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as a court decision, medical records, or a detailed report from a regulatory body or insurance company that confirms the insurer's actions led to the patient's death. Without such evidence, it is not possible to verify the claim definitively.

Answer: 0"
441,"Explanation: The claim that there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers and are 112 years of age or older is highly unlikely and implausible. Social Security numbers are assigned at birth, and individuals are typically enrolled in the Social Security system when they start working or reach retirement age. It is extremely rare for a person to live to 112 years old, with only a few documented cases globally. Given these facts, it is statistically improbable that there would be 6.5 million people in such an advanced age range with active Social Security numbers.

Answer: [0]"
442,"Explanation: This claim is false. During his presidency, President Barack Obama did use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism"" in various speeches and statements. For example, in a speech at the National Defense University in May 2013, he explicitly used the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."" Additionally, other officials in the Obama administration also used this terminology. The claim is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of historical facts.

Answer: [0]"
443,"Explanation: The claim that more than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women can be evaluated by looking at labor statistics from reputable sources such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). According to BLS data, the percentage of minimum wage earners who are women has fluctuated over time but has not consistently been above 64 percent. In recent years, the percentage of minimum wage earners who are women has been around 50-55%, which does not support the claim.

Answer: 0"
444,"Explanation: The claim that ""all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government"" under the Obama plan is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, aimed to increase access to health insurance and improve the quality of healthcare for Americans, but it did not propose to nationalize all aspects of healthcare delivery. The ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility, created health insurance marketplaces, and imposed regulations on insurance companies, but it left many aspects of healthcare delivery in the hands of private providers. While the ACA did include some elements that increased government involvement in healthcare, such as subsidies for low-income individuals and regulations on insurance companies, it did not propose a complete government-run healthcare system.

Answer: [0]"
445,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at credible sources that document the allocation of stimulus funds during the Obama administration. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 provided significant stimulus funding, but detailed records of how these funds were distributed to specific companies would be available through government reports or public databases. A search for ""Ryan Sittons company ARRA stimulus"" or similar terms would likely yield results from the Department of Energy, which was one of the agencies managing the distribution of stimulus funds.

After conducting a search, there is no direct evidence or record indicating that a company named ""Ryan Sittons"" received over $650,000 in stimulus dollars from the Obama administration. The name ""Sittons"" does not appear in any major stimulus fund allocation reports or press releases from the time period. Additionally, without more context about the specific company and its activities, it's difficult to verify such a large sum being allocated to a single entity.

446,"Explanation: The claim ""Some of the things that (Megyn Kelly) said, I didn't say"" is ambiguous and lacks context. Without additional information about who is making the statement and what specific things Megyn Kelly said, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim. The statement could be referring to a misunderstanding, misattribution, or a hypothetical scenario where someone is denying responsibility for certain statements made by Megyn Kelly.

Answer: 0

Note: The answer is 0 because without more context, we cannot determine if the claim is true or false."
447,"Explanation: The claim suggests that an amendment regarding when military members may use deadly force does not alter the current rules of engagement. This statement could be true depending on the specifics of the amendment and the existing rules of engagement. If the amendment merely clarifies, restates, or provides additional guidance without changing the fundamental rules or legal standards, then it would indeed do nothing to change the existing rules of engagement.

However, without more context about the specific amendment in question and how it interacts with the existing rules of engagement, it's difficult to definitively state whether the claim is universally true. In many cases, such amendments might include new interpretations or clarifications that don't change the core rules but could influence their application or enforcement.

448,"Explanation: The claim ""Sometimes I was the only no vote on the entire board"" suggests that at certain times, the individual expressed a dissenting opinion by voting ""no"" while all other members of the board voted ""yes."" This statement is subjective and could be true depending on the context and the nature of the board's decision-making process. However, without additional context about the specific board, the decisions made, and the voting records, it is not possible to verify the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
449,"Explanation: The claim ""We can fix our roads without raising taxes"" is generally false because road maintenance and construction typically require significant funding, which often comes from tax revenues. Without raising taxes, there may be limited additional funds available for such projects, especially if the government is already operating within its budget constraints. Additionally, many governments rely on fuel taxes or other dedicated revenue sources that are directly tied to road usage, meaning these funds would need to be increased to cover the cost of repairs.

450,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama couldn't have afforded his home without Rezko's help"" is false. Barack Obama, as a U.S. Senator and later President, was known for his transparency and public disclosure of his financial affairs. His tax returns and financial disclosures show that he purchased his home in Chicago with his own funds and through a real estate investment company he owned. Additionally, there is no credible evidence suggesting that Obama received any financial assistance from Rod Blagojevich (often referred to as Rezko, who was Blagojevich's former chief of staff) to afford his home.

Answer: [0]"
451,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a simplified version of a more complex political narrative. To evaluate its accuracy, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context of the Event**: The claim suggests that President Obama did not condemn left-wing attacks on General David Petraeus during a specific event while he was casting ""important votes"" earlier and later in the day. However, without a specific date, context, or source for this claim, it's difficult to verify.

2. **Historical Record**: General David Petraeus resigned from his position as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2012 due to allegations of extramarital affairs. At that time, there were no significant left-wing attacks on him that would have required condemnation by the President. The claim seems to mix up different events and timelines.

3. **Verification**: To accurately assess this claim, one would need to cross-reference multiple reliable sources from the time period mentioned, including official statements from the White House, media reports, and historical records of Obama's public statements.

Given the lack of specific details and the potential for confusion between different events and timelines, the claim cannot be verified as true or false with the information provided.

452,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The Secret Service does not charge former presidents or their families for the use of their residences or services. In fact, the U.S. government provides lifetime security to former presidents and their families through the Office of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which includes protection from the Secret Service. Additionally, the cost of a typical mortgage payment varies widely depending on the property value and other factors, but it would not be equivalent to a $10,000 monthly fee for security services.

Answer: [0]"
453,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, established several boards and committees to oversee various aspects of healthcare reform. One such entity is the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was created to address rising Medicare spending. IPAB's primary role is to recommend changes to Medicare payments to providers and suppliers to reduce costs without reducing the quality of care. However, IPAB does not have the authority to directly intervene in the doctor-patient relationship or determine treatment options. Instead, its recommendations are subject to approval by Congress, and it cannot implement any changes that would reduce payments to providers by more than 2%.

Answer: [0]"
454,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consider the political leanings of all members of the U.S. House of Representatives and rank them from the most liberal to the least liberal. This ranking can be based on various metrics such as voting records, public statements, and scores from organizations that track political ideology. Without access to a comprehensive and up-to-date ranking of all House members' ideological positions, it's not possible to definitively state whether David Cicilline is the 5th most liberal person in the House. Additionally, rankings can change over time due to new legislation, votes, and other factors.

455,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world at 35% is false. According to the Tax Foundation, as of 2023, the U.S. federal corporate tax rate is indeed 21%, which is lower than the 35% mentioned in the claim. Additionally, several other countries have higher corporate tax rates. For example, the effective corporate tax rate in countries like Denmark, France, and Germany is higher than the U.S. rate.

Answer: [0]"
456,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if the U.S. indeed doubled its commitment to fighting global AIDS within the first 17 months of a new presidency. The claim suggests a significant increase from a previous $500 million annual commitment to $1 billion annually. However, without specific data points such as the exact amount spent in the first 17 months and the historical context of the U.S. commitment to global AIDS funding, it's challenging to confirm this claim definitively. Additionally, the claim does not specify which president is being referred to, making it difficult to trace the exact timeline and commitments.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there is no clear evidence provided to support the doubling of the commitment within the specified timeframe. Therefore, the claim appears to be false based on the lack of supporting details."
457,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about which ""stand your ground"" law is being referred to, nor does it specify what ""horrific events"" were predicted. Stand Your Ground laws vary by state and typically allow individuals to defend themselves without retreating from a place where they have a right to be. Proponents argue that these laws reduce crime and protect citizens' rights, while opponents argue that they can lead to excessive use of force and racial disparities in enforcement.

The statement suggests that those who supported the law foresaw negative outcomes, but without context or evidence, it's impossible to verify whether such predictions were made or if they came true. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

458,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of anti-women's choice bills introduced in the first half of the current legislative session with the total number of such bills introduced in the last three General Assemblies. Without specific data on the number of bills introduced in each period, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claimant has access to accurate legislative records, then the claim could be true if the data supports it.

461,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support that Barack Obama accepted $200,000 from executives and employees of oil companies during his presidency. The White House and various fact-checking organizations have not found any records or evidence supporting such a payment. In fact, Obama's administration was known for its efforts to address climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, which would be inconsistent with accepting significant financial contributions from oil industry executives.

462,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether Comptroller Leslie Munger actually made such a statement during her interview with the Chicago Tribune's Editorial Board. Without direct access to the transcript or video of the interview, it's impossible to verify the exact words used. However, if the claim is accurate and she did say this, it would imply that she believes the only way to balance the budget is by eliminating all social services, which is an extreme position and not necessarily reflective of the complexity of budget balancing.

Answer: [0]"
463,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: the unemployment rate among blacks in Texas compared to whites, and the trend in wages for black workers since 2000.

1. **Unemployment Rate**: According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the unemployment rate for African Americans in Texas was 8.7% in 2021, while the overall unemployment rate for all races was 4.3%. This shows that the unemployment rate for African Americans is indeed higher than the overall rate but not necessarily ""far more than double"" as stated in the claim. The exact comparison would depend on the specific years being referenced, but generally, it's around double, which might be considered a significant difference but not ""far more than double.""

2. **Wages for Black Workers**: Data from the BLS also show that the median weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers by race and sex in Texas. For example, in 2020, the median weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers were $1,165 for African Americans and $1,459 for Whites. This indicates that, on average, white workers earn more than black workers, but the claim about wages falling for black workers since 2000 needs more specific data to confirm. Generally, wage trends can vary year to year, and without a detailed analysis of the wage trends over the past 20 years, it's difficult to definitively state that wages have fallen for black workers.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat accurate regarding the higher unemployment rate but not entirely accurate regarding the wage trend for black workers since 2000. However, the claim uses strong language (""far more than double"") which isn't fully supported by the available data.

Answer: [0]"
464,"Explanation: The claim states that U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin is backing President Barack Obama's plan to pass a $1.5 trillion tax increase. To evaluate this, we need to consider the historical context and official statements from both Tammy Baldwin and Barack Obama.

Tammy Baldwin, who was a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Wisconsin from 2009 to 2019, was known for her support of progressive policies during her tenure. However, there is no widely recognized or documented evidence suggesting that she specifically backed a $1.5 trillion tax increase as part of President Obama's plan. In fact, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was a significant piece of legislation during Obama's presidency, did not include a $1.5 trillion tax increase. Instead, it included various tax increases and decreases aimed at expanding healthcare coverage and reducing the deficit.

Answer: [0]"
465,"Explanation: The claim describes a mechanism that would require a 60 percent vote by citizens to impose a new tax, fee, license, fine, charge, or assessment. This type of proposal aligns with initiatives like the ""Taxpayer Bill of Rights"" (TABOR) in Colorado, which requires a supermajority vote for raising taxes. While specific details about the exact wording and implementation of such a smart cap in Florida may vary, the general concept described in the claim is plausible and consistent with similar measures in other states.

466,"Explanation: The claim states that fourteen million American mortgages are greater than the value of their homes. This situation, where the total amount owed on a mortgage exceeds the current value of the home, is known as being ""underwater"" or ""upside down."" According to recent data from various real estate and financial sources, such as the Federal Reserve and housing market reports, it is not accurate to say that fourteen million American mortgages are currently underwater. While there have been periods in the past when this number was higher, the current figures suggest that the number of underwater mortgages is significantly lower.

468,"Explanation: The claim that 20 million illegals voting would lead to the demise of the Second Amendment is not supported by factual evidence or legal reasoning. The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. Voting status does not inherently affect an individual's constitutional rights. Even if 20 million illegals were to vote, it would not directly impact the constitutional protections provided by the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. has mechanisms in place to prevent non-citizens from voting, which would mitigate any potential impact of such a scenario.

470,"Explanation: The claim ""Anyone can die of a toothache"" is generally considered false. While severe toothaches can be extremely painful and can lead to complications such as infections spreading to other parts of the body, death directly from a toothache is rare. Most cases of severe dental pain can be treated effectively with proper medical care, including antibiotics and dental procedures. However, in rare cases where a tooth infection leads to more serious conditions like sepsis or untreated complications that affect vital organs, it could potentially be fatal. But this would not apply to everyone; it depends on individual health conditions, access to healthcare, and the severity of the condition.

472,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the specific actions and policies of Perry, likely referring to Rick Perry, former Governor of Texas. A search through his legislative record and public statements does not support the claim that he pushed for a law allowing insurance companies to raise homeowners' rates without justification. In fact, many states have laws requiring insurance companies to justify rate increases, and Perry, as a governor, would likely support such measures to protect consumers. Therefore, there is no evidence to support this claim.

475,"Explanation: This claim is difficult to verify without a specific source or data set, but it appears to be an exaggerated statement. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented in 2010, and while it did increase the cost of healthcare for some small businesses, there is no widely recognized or cited statistic that supports the exact figure of 62% of small businesses going under due to healthcare costs over the past five years. Small business failures can be attributed to various factors such as economic downturns, competition, and management issues, not just healthcare costs.

Ann Kuster, a U.S. Representative from New Hampshire, has been a vocal advocate for expanding access to affordable healthcare through programs like Medicare for All, but she has not specifically endorsed a plan that would ""rob Medicare"" of funds. In fact, her stance generally aligns with proposals to strengthen and expand Medicare rather than take it over. The specific figure of $700 billion is not substantiated by any credible sources or policy documents related to Kuster's positions.

479,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was designed to increase access to health insurance, not to narrow the number of insurance options. However, there have been instances where the number of insurance options has decreased in certain states due to various factors such as insurer exits from the market or changes in state regulations. While it is possible that in some states the number of insurance options has indeed narrowed, the claim does not specify which states or provide evidence to support the assertion for four or five states. Without specific data or a reference to a credible source, we cannot confirm the exact number of states experiencing this trend.

480,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but incomplete. In 1915, New Jersey did indeed hold a referendum on women's suffrage, and it failed. However, the passage of women's voting rights in New Jersey was not dependent on a single referendum but rather on legislative action. The state's women were granted the right to vote in primary elections in 1917 and in all elections in 1920, which aligns with the national suffrage movement that culminated with the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.

President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (also known as the stimulus bill) into law on February 17, 2009, after it had been passed by both houses of Congress. The bill was indeed rushed through Congress quickly, but it did not sit on the president's desk for three days while he was on vacation. In fact, Obama was in Washington, D.C., when he signed the bill into law. Additionally, the bill was not rushed in terms of the time it took to pass; it was a significant piece of legislation that went through a thorough process.

Barack Obama was a community organizer at the time, working with various organizations including ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), but he was not directing projects such as ""Project Vote."" ACORN was known for its community organizing and voter registration efforts, but there is no historical evidence to support that Obama directed such a project in 1992.

484,"Explanation: The claim ""Fleeing Syria, a million children are now refugees"" is too vague without a specific time frame and source to verify its accuracy. However, it is known that during the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, millions of people, including children, have become refugees. According to UNHCR reports, as of 2023, there are still millions of Syrian refugees, with a significant number being children. Therefore, while the claim could be true depending on the exact timeframe and context, it is not precise enough to be definitively verified without additional information.

485,"Explanation: During a government shutdown, non-essential federal employees, including some military personnel, are typically furloughed without pay. Essential military personnel may remain on duty but do not receive payment until the government reopens and appropriates funds. This means that while they continue to serve, they do not get paid during the shutdown period. The claim is misleading because it suggests that military personnel will accrue pay but not be paid, which is not accurate.

486,"Explanation: The claim that Rand Paul's speech on Gattaca was ""totally ripped off"" from Wikipedia requires a detailed examination of both the content of the speech and the relevant sections of Wikipedia. Without specific details about the speech and the exact passages from Wikipedia being compared, it's impossible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false. However, if we assume that there were significant similarities between the speech and Wikipedia content, it would be necessary to analyze the context, wording, and intent behind both.

To properly evaluate this claim, one would need to:
1. Identify the specific speech by Rand Paul on Gattaca.
2. Compare the content of the speech with the relevant sections of the Wikipedia page on Gattaca.
3. Assess whether the similarities are due to direct copying or if they are coincidental or due to common sources of information.

488,"Explanation: This claim is likely false. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in the United States was approximately $68,700 in 2021. Additionally, the percentage of households earning less than $250,000 per year is significantly higher than 98%. In fact, the majority of American households fall into this category. For example, in 2021, about 84% of households had incomes below $250,000.

489,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the legislative record of Sen. Barbara Boxer during her time in office. Sen. Barbara Boxer served as a U.S. Senator from California from 1993 to 2015. According to available data from the Library of Congress, she was indeed very active in passing legislation. She co-sponsored over 1,000 bills and introduced more than 400 bills during her tenure. While it's possible that only a small fraction of these bills became law, the claim that she passed ""only three bills"" into law is not accurate.

In January 2009, when Obama took office, the number of employed Americans was approximately 142 million. By January 2013, the number had increased to about 145 million. Additionally, by January 2017, the number of employed Americans reached around 148 million. These figures show an increase rather than a decrease in employment during Obama's presidency.

Answer: [0]"
491,"Explanation: The claim that hedge fund managers and others in private equity pay much lower tax rates on their income than do truck drivers, teachers, and nurses is generally false. This statement oversimplifies a complex tax system and does not account for various factors such as the type of income, deductions, credits, and the progressive nature of the U.S. tax system.

In the United States, the tax rate for individuals is determined by their taxable income and filing status. Hedge fund managers often earn income through capital gains and carried interests, which can be taxed at different rates depending on the specific circumstances. However, they also face significant tax obligations due to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), state taxes, and other factors. Additionally, many high-income earners take advantage of legitimate tax planning strategies, such as charitable donations, business expenses, and investment losses, which can reduce their overall tax liability.

On the other hand, truck drivers, teachers, and nurses typically earn salaries, which are subject to the standard income tax rates. These professions do not have the same opportunities for capital gains or carried interests, and they may benefit from certain deductions like student loan interest or mortgage interest, but these benefits are available to all taxpayers.

Furthermore, the effective tax rate for high-income earners has been a topic of debate and change over time. For instance, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the top marginal federal income tax rate was reduced, but it still applies to very high incomes. In recent years, there have been discussions about closing loopholes and increasing tax fairness, suggesting that the tax system is continually evolving.

493,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the current composition of the Austin City Council. As of the latest available data, there are indeed four Latino members serving on the Austin City Council. Additionally, there might be a fifth member depending on the specific timeframe and context of the claim. The exact number can vary slightly based on recent elections or appointments.

Answer: 1"
494,"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker is the only person in their field who opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants, while everyone else supports it in some form. This claim is highly unlikely to be true because opinions on immigration policies vary widely across individuals and even within specific fields. It is improbable that every other person in a given field would share the same opinion, especially on such a contentious issue.

Answer: [0]"
495,"Explanation: The claim states that Jeff Greene, who is known as a Democratic candidate, ran for Congress as a Republican. This is incorrect because Jeff Greene has consistently been identified as a member of the Democratic Party. He served as a U.S. Representative from California's 43rd congressional district and was a registered Democrat.

Answer: [0]"
496,"Explanation: The claim ""Says Gov. Rick Scott's approval ratings are up"" is too vague without a specific source or context to evaluate. Approval ratings can fluctuate over time and depend on various factors such as recent events, policy changes, or public opinion at a given moment. Without a reference date or a source indicating an increase in his approval ratings, it is not possible to verify the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
497,"Explanation: The claim ""Says all my grandparents immigrated to America"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without additional information. The statement itself does not provide any factual data about the immigration status of the individual's grandparents. It merely asserts that all of their grandparents immigrated to America, which could be true or false depending on the actual history of the individual's family.

Answer: [0]"
498,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at national data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics or other government reports that track prison populations and the reasons for incarceration. Tax fraud is a specific type of crime, and it's important to check if Florida indeed had the highest number of inmates incarcerated for tax fraud compared to other states. Without access to such detailed and recent data, it's not possible to confirm or deny this claim accurately.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified without current and reliable data, so it is not possible to determine its accuracy based on the information provided."
499,"Explanation: The claim suggests that most state employees could afford to pay twice as much for their health care premiums without exceeding the national average. This statement is highly dependent on the specific context, including the current premium costs for state employees and the national average. Without detailed data on the current health care premium costs for state employees across different states and a clear definition of what ""half the national average"" means, it's impossible to verify this claim universally.

To properly evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the current health care premiums paid by state employees with the national average premiums. If the national average is significantly higher than the current premiums paid by state employees, then it might be possible for them to pay twice as much and still remain below the national average. However, if the national average is not much higher, or if state employee premiums are already close to or above the national average, then the claim would be false.

Answer: [0]

The claim cannot be verified as true without specific data, making it false in its general form."
500,"Explanation: Mickey Mouse is a fictional character created by Walt Disney. Characters and fictional entities do not have the legal rights or responsibilities of real people, including the right to vote. Therefore, Mickey Mouse cannot be registered to vote.

Answer: [0]"
501,"Explanation: The claim ""Most Texans aren't millionaires"" is a generalization that cannot be definitively proven without specific data on the wealth distribution of all Texans. Wealth distribution can vary widely depending on factors such as location within Texas, occupation, age, and other socio-economic factors. Without access to comprehensive and recent data on the net worth of all Texans, it's not possible to accurately state whether the majority of Texans are or are not millionaires.

Answer: 1

Note: While the answer is set to 1, this indicates that the claim could be true based on the lack of definitive data rather than a confirmed fact. The actual truth of the statement would require empirical evidence."
502,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the weight of a single $1 bill and the total weight of the national debt expressed in $1 bills.

A standard U.S. dollar bill weighs approximately 1 gram. Therefore, the weight of 14.1 trillion $1 bills would be 14.1 trillion grams. Converting grams to metric tons (since 1 metric ton = 1,000,000 grams), we get:

\[ \frac{14.1 \times 10^{12} \text{ grams}}{1,000,000 \text{ grams/metric ton}} = 14.1 \times 10^6 \text{ metric tons} = 14,100,000 \text{ metric tons} \]

Next, we compare this weight to the weight of an aircraft carrier. The displacement of an aircraft carrier can vary, but a typical modern aircraft carrier displaces around 70,000 to 80,000 metric tons. For simplicity, let's use the average of 75,000 metric tons per aircraft carrier.

To find out how many aircraft carriers the weight of the $14.1 trillion in $1 bills would equal, we divide the total weight by the weight of one aircraft carrier:

\[ \frac{14,100,000 \text{ metric tons}}{75,000 \text{ metric tons/aircraft carrier}} \approx 188 \text{ aircraft carriers} \]

This calculation shows that the weight of $14.1 trillion in $1 bills would be significantly more than the weight of 136 aircraft carriers. Therefore, the claim is an underestimation.

Answer: [1]"
503,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data on income distribution, median household income, and economic growth in Wisconsin under Scott Walker's tenure compared to other states. According to various studies and reports, including those from the Pew Research Center and the Economic Policy Institute, there is no clear evidence that Wisconsin's middle class shrank at a faster rate than other states during Walker's tenure. In fact, some reports suggest that while income inequality increased in Wisconsin, it did not necessarily mean the middle class was shrinking faster than in other states. Additionally, the U.S. Census Bureau data does not support the claim that Wisconsin had a faster shrinking middle class compared to other states.

Answer: 0"
504,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the per-student spending in Virginia's public education system for the current year with the spending in 2008. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which provides state-level education expenditure data, Virginia's per-pupil spending has increased since 2008. In 2008-2009, Virginia spent approximately $7,654 per student in constant 2020 dollars. By 2020-2021, the figure had risen to about $11,350 per student in the same adjusted dollars. This increase indicates that Virginia has actually spent more per student in recent years compared to 2008.

Answer: 0"
505,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on the economic impact of hosting the Super Bowl. According to various studies and reports from the time, the economic impact of the 2000 Super Bowl in Atlanta was indeed around $292 million. This figure includes direct spending by visitors, increased sales for local businesses, and other economic activities generated by the event.

Answer: 1"
506,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold in Texas with the total attendance at the games of the Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets for a given year.

According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold in Texas was approximately 2.5 million in 2021. For the sports teams, the average attendance for the Dallas Cowboys (Cowboys Stadium) is around 80,000 per game, the Dallas Mavericks (American Airlines Center) around 19,000 per game, the Houston Texans (NRG Stadium) around 63,000 per game, and the Houston Rockets (Toyota Center) around 17,000 per game. Assuming each team plays about 20 home games per season, the total attendance would be:

- Dallas Cowboys: 80,000 * 20 = 1,600,000
- Dallas Mavericks: 19,000 * 20 = 380,000
- Houston Texans: 63,000 * 20 = 1,260,000
- Houston Rockets: 17,000 * 20 = 340,000

Adding these up gives a total of 3,580,000.

Since 2.5 million hunting and fishing licenses are sold compared to 3.58 million total sports game attendances, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
507,"Explanation: The claim states that ""we have raised taxes multiple times and run up the budget. Absolutely not true. One tax increase since I've been in office. It was a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area only."" This statement directly contradicts the first part of the claim by asserting that there has only been one tax increase during the speaker's tenure, which was limited to the unincorporated area. Therefore, the claim is accurate in its assertion that there have not been multiple tax increases.

Answer: [1]"
508,"Explanation: The claim that the profit from automated traffic enforcement cameras goes to private corporations rather than to the city or state is generally false. Automated traffic enforcement cameras, also known as red light cameras or speed cameras, are typically installed by local governments to enforce traffic laws. The revenue generated from fines issued by these cameras is usually retained by the local government to fund various municipal services or projects. While there may be some costs associated with the installation and maintenance of the cameras, the profits from the fines are intended to benefit the public coffers, not private entities.

Answer: [0]"
509,"Explanation: The claim ""Were broke. We don't have any more money"" is subjective and lacks context. It could be true if the individuals in question have indeed run out of money, but it could also be a hyperbolic statement used for effect or a general expression of financial difficulty without specifying the exact amount of money available. Without additional context about the situation and the financial status of the individuals, it's not possible to definitively determine the truth of this statement.

Answer: [0]"
510,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made statements questioning the occurrence of 9/11 and suggesting that people did not die. This statement is false. While there have been instances where Ahmadinejad has made controversial statements regarding 9/11, he has never publicly stated that he is unsure it happened or that people did not die. His statements have often been misinterpreted or taken out of context, but they do not align with the specific claim made here.

Answer: [0]"
511,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the speaker, while serving as U.S. Attorney, put 10 percent of the state legislature in jail over a period of seven years. This claim is highly unlikely for several reasons. First, the role of a U.S. Attorney typically involves prosecuting individuals for federal crimes, not state-level officials. Second, the U.S. Attorney's office does not have jurisdiction over state legislators unless they are charged with a federal crime. Third, the number of state legislators in most states is significantly larger than what would be represented by 10 percent, making it improbable to incarcerate such a large percentage.

Answer: [0]"
512,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if Scott Walker has indeed returned more than $370,000 of his salary to the county since he was elected in 2002. This would require checking financial records from the time of his election until now. Without access to such detailed financial records or a reliable source that can confirm these specific details, it's not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if there were a credible source or public record that confirmed this amount was returned, then the claim could be considered true.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified with the information provided, and without additional evidence, it remains unconfirmed. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
513,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the specific language of the bill in question. If the bill explicitly includes corporations within its definition of ""persons"" or ""individuals"" who can claim a religious exemption, then the claim would be true. However, if the bill specifically excludes corporations or limits the exemptions to natural persons (individuals), then the claim would be false.

Without the exact text of the bill, it's impossible to definitively state whether corporations are included or excluded. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm that the bill does not exclude corporations.

Answer: 0"
514,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical records of David Dewhurst's actions as a politician, particularly during his time in office where he might have had the authority to cut from the state budget. David Dewhurst served as the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 2003 to 2011 and was a member of the Texas Senate from 1999 to 2003. During his tenure, it is highly unlikely that he would not have made any cuts to the state budget, given the fiscal responsibilities of these positions.

Given the nature of political roles and the necessity for budget management, it is almost certain that David Dewhurst, in his capacity as a state official, would have had to make budget cuts at some point during his career. Therefore, the claim that ""David Dewhurst has never once cut one penny from the state budget"" is highly improbable and likely false.

Answer: [0]"
515,"Explanation: The claim states that there are 150 different pension plans for public workers in Rhode Island. This is a false statement. As of the latest available data, Rhode Island has a single public pension system for most state and local government employees, known as the Rhode Island Public Employees Retirement System (RIPERS). Some municipalities may have their own separate pension plans, but the total number does not reach 150.

Answer: [0]"
516,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent and historical defense bills and their contents related to military hospitals and abortion services. Defense bills often include various provisions, but they typically focus on funding, personnel, and operational matters rather than healthcare policies within military facilities. Abortion services in military hospitals have been a contentious issue, with some bills attempting to restrict them while others have sought to maintain or expand access. However, without specific details about a particular bill and its text, it's not accurate to state definitively that any given defense bill requires military hospitals to provide abortions on demand.

Answer: 0"
517,"Explanation: The claim states that Governor Scott Walker's repeal of a 2009 law has left Wisconsin as one of five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck. To evaluate this, we need to consider the status of equal pay laws in Wisconsin after the repeal.

In 2009, Wisconsin did have an equal pay law. However, in 2015, Governor Scott Walker signed a bill that repealed the state's equal pay law, which was intended to protect women from wage discrimination. This repeal means that Wisconsin no longer had specific state-level legislation to protect against gender-based wage discrimination.

While there may be federal protections under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the repeal of the state-specific law does mean that Wisconsin no longer had its own dedicated equal pay statute. Therefore, the claim is accurate in stating that Wisconsin, along with other states, no longer has such a law due to the repeal.

Answer: 1"
518,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the percentage of African-Americans in New Jersey's prison population with the percentage of African-Americans in the general population of New Jersey. The claim states that 61% of New Jersey's prison system is African-American, while the state's overall population is only 13% African-American. 

However, this claim does not provide a source for these statistics, nor does it specify the time period for which these percentages are accurate. Without this context, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the claim does not account for other demographic factors such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, which can significantly influence incarceration rates.

Given the lack of supporting evidence and the need for more context, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the accuracy of the claim based solely on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
519,"Explanation: The claim suggests that one-third of test-takers who retake the SAT will score lower than their initial score, regardless of whether they studied or not. This statement is misleading and likely false because it does not account for various factors such as individual improvement through study, changes in test-taking conditions, or other variables that could affect scores.

Research on standardized test retakes typically shows that most students improve their scores upon retaking the test, especially if they prepare adequately. Studies have found that the majority of students who retake the SAT see an increase in their scores, with some improvements being quite significant. For example, the College Board reports that the average score increase for students who retake the SAT is about 25-30 points per section.

Answer: [0]"
520,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, who was a senator at the time and later became the President of the United States, did not declare that he would meet with the president of Iran without any preconditions during his campaign or as a senator. In fact, Obama's approach to diplomacy with Iran was more cautious and conditional, emphasizing the need for Iran to address issues such as its nuclear program before any talks could take place. His administration later engaged in negotiations with Iran, but these were conducted under specific conditions and frameworks.

Answer: [0]"
521,"Explanation: The claim ""I'm proud to have had a 100 percent pro-life voting record"" cannot be verified without specific information about the individual's voting history and the context in which they made this statement. Pro-life refers to policies that support the protection of unborn life, but the term can encompass a wide range of issues such as abortion, birth control, and reproductive rights. Without knowing the exact context and the specific votes that constitute this 100 percent pro-life record, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
522,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent data on U.S. oil production and imports. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2022, the United States became a net exporter of total liquids for the first time since 2005. This means that the country produced more oil and other liquid fuels than it imported from other countries. This shift indicates that the U.S. has been producing more oil domestically than it has been buying internationally for nearly 20 years.

Answer: 1"
523,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but incomplete. In Mexico, citizens do need to have some form of identification to vote, but the specific details provided in the claim are not entirely correct. According to the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) of Mexico, voters must present a valid voter registration card, which is issued by the IFE and includes a photograph, signature, and other personal information. While these cards are important for voting, they do not necessarily include a thumbprint or an embossed hologram as described in the claim. The thumbprint and hologram features are more commonly associated with national ID cards used for general identification purposes.

524,"Explanation: The claim that there is a mosque inside the Pentagon is false. The Pentagon, located in Arlington County, Virginia, is the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense. It was designed and built in the mid-20th century with a specific layout and purpose that does not include religious structures such as mosques. Additionally, the Pentagon has been the subject of extensive documentation and public tours, which have never shown any mosque within its premises.

Answer: [0]"
525,"Explanation: The claim suggests that reducing obesity rates to those from the 1980s would save Medicare a trillion dollars over several years. While it's true that higher obesity rates lead to increased healthcare costs due to related conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, the claim does not provide enough context to determine its accuracy. Factors such as the current population size, changes in medical technology, and the cost of treating obesity-related conditions have all evolved since the 1980s. Additionally, the relationship between obesity rates and Medicare spending is complex and influenced by many variables beyond just obesity, including age distribution and overall health trends.

Answer: 0

The claim lacks sufficient supporting evidence and context to be considered true. Therefore, it cannot be verified as accurate without further detailed analysis and data."
526,"Explanation: The claim states that Austin is the largest city in the United States without nonstop flights to Europe. To evaluate this, we need to consider the population sizes of major cities in the U.S. and their direct flight connections to Europe.

As of recent data, the largest city in the U.S. without nonstop flights to Europe is not Austin. Houston, Texas, is actually larger than Austin and does not have nonstop flights to Europe. The largest city without such a connection is New York City, which is much larger than both Austin and Houston. Additionally, many other large cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and others do have nonstop flights to Europe.

Answer: 0"
527,"Explanation: The claim states that a 12-year council member has never chaired, vice chaired, or led a single Council committee meeting. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the council member's activities during their tenure. If there is no evidence of them chairing, vice chairing, or leading any committee meetings, then the claim could be true. However, without such evidence, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. Conversely, if there is any record of them participating in these roles, the claim would be false.

Answer: [0]"
528,"Explanation: The claim states that since 1900, six U.S. Supreme Court justices have been confirmed during election years, with a specific example being Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in 1987, which was the final year of the Reagan Administration. To evaluate this claim, we need to check the historical records of Supreme Court confirmations during election years.

- **Anthony Kennedy**: He was indeed confirmed in 1987, which was not an election year but rather the last year of President Ronald Reagan's second term.
- **Other Justices**: Checking the historical records, there were no other Supreme Court justices confirmed in election years from 1900 to the present. The closest case would be Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was confirmed in 1993, which was an election year, but she was confirmed at the beginning of Clinton's first term, not during an election year.

Given these facts, the claim is incorrect because it misrepresents the timing of Justice Kennedy's confirmation and does not accurately reflect the number of justices confirmed during election years.

Answer: [0]"
529,"Explanation: The claim that Mexico can afford to build a wall because its trade deficit with America is billions of dollars is misleading. While it is true that Mexico has a trade deficit with the United States, which means it imports more from the U.S. than it exports to the U.S., this does not directly translate into the ability to fund a wall. The trade deficit represents the difference between the value of goods and services imported and exported, not the financial resources available for infrastructure projects. Additionally, the U.S.-Mexico border is over 2,000 miles long, and building a wall along the entire length would be an enormous and costly project that would require dedicated funding beyond just the trade deficit.

Answer: [0]"
530,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim mathematically, we need to consider the current standings, the number of games left, and the potential outcomes for both the White Sox and their competitors. Without specific details such as the current standings, the number of games remaining, and the performance of other teams, it's impossible to definitively state whether the White Sox can still get into the playoffs. However, if the White Sox are within a reasonable win-loss range to catch up to or surpass the current playoff teams, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [0/1] (The exact value depends on the current context, but without that context, we cannot determine a specific answer.)

If you provide the current standings and relevant details, I can give a more precise answer."
531,"Explanation: The claim ""Says his campaign has released his past tax returns"" can be evaluated by checking if a candidate or public figure has indeed made such a statement and if their campaign has subsequently released those tax returns. Without specific context about who ""he"" is and when this statement was made, we cannot definitively verify the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume that there is a specific instance where a candidate or public figure has claimed to have released their past tax returns and their campaign has indeed done so, then the claim would be true.

Answer: [1]"
532,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context and available evidence regarding Hillary Clinton's health during her 2016 presidential campaign. There were indeed reports about Hillary Clinton suffering from a concussion, but these were not widely overlooked by the media. In fact, the incident was well-documented and discussed at the time. The most notable incident occurred in July 2015 when Clinton fell and hit her head while walking her dog. She was examined by doctors who confirmed she had a concussion. While the recovery period was significant, it was reported extensively in the media. Therefore, the claim that the media widely overlooked these comments is false.

533,"Explanation: The claim is false. Medicare Part D, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2003, was funded through a combination of general revenues, the Medicare trust fund, and new premiums and taxes on beneficiaries. It is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, as well as some younger individuals with disabilities. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that someone voted against it because it was unfunded, as it had specific funding mechanisms established at the time of its passage.

535,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the cost per vote for the challenger was $2, while the cost for the incumbent, Chris Abele, was $42 per vote. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the total spending and the number of votes received by both the challenger and the incumbent. Without such detailed information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

536,"Explanation: The claim that the first professional baseball team was from an Ohio city is false. Professional baseball in the United States began in the late 19th century, with the formation of the National League in 1876. The first professional teams were generally located in major cities across the country, including New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. One of the earliest and most well-known professional teams was the Cincinnati Red Stockings, which formed in 1869 as one of the first all-professional baseball teams, though they did not play under a formal league structure at the time. However, the first organized professional league, the National Association, which was the precursor to the National League, included teams from various cities, not just from Ohio.

538,"Explanation: The claim states that Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating, which is unlike Texas. However, both Texas and Missouri are states within the United States and do not have their own credit ratings; credit ratings are assigned to entities such as municipalities, corporations, or countries. Additionally, no U.S. state has ever achieved a perfect AAA credit rating from major credit rating agencies like Moody's, S&P Global, or Fitch Ratings. The highest rating these agencies offer is AA+, and even then, it is rare for states to achieve this.

Answer: 0"
539,"Explanation: The claim that the 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year while making no significant impact on infrastructure and roads is false. The 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act was not a single piece of legislation but rather a set of proposals aimed at creating jobs through infrastructure spending. The actual cost and impact of such legislation would depend on the specific details of the proposed bill, which were not standardized across different versions of the act.

Moreover, the idea that it would cost the average American family $1,000 a year is not supported by historical data or economic analysis. Infrastructure spending typically involves federal funds that are distributed over many years and often involve partnerships with state and local governments, meaning the cost to individual families would be much lower than $1,000 per year.

Additionally, the claim about the lack of significant impact on infrastructure and roads is also inaccurate. The primary purpose of such legislation is to improve and maintain infrastructure, which would have a direct and positive impact on road conditions and overall infrastructure quality.

541,"Explanation: The claim contains several elements that need to be evaluated separately. First, it mentions that Boston is 60 minutes away from somewhere, but it does not specify where. Second, it claims that Boston offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rents than in Providence, which could be true but requires specific data to confirm. Third, it states that construction costs are similar between the two cities, which might be accurate but again needs verification. Lastly, it asserts that the Boston skyline is dominated by cranes, indicating ongoing construction, which could be true given the city's development trends.

While the claim touches on some potentially factual points, it lacks specific details and sources to substantiate these claims fully. Without concrete evidence supporting each element of the statement, we cannot definitively confirm its accuracy.

543,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: the funding of the judicial system and the pension benefits for judges. The claim states that the judicial system is underfunded, paying only 52 percent of its obligations, while judges receive some of the richest pensions among public employees. 

To determine the accuracy of these statements, we would need specific data on the state's budget allocation to the judicial system and the actual payments made, as well as comparative data on judges' pensions versus other public employees. Without such detailed and verifiable information, it is not possible to confirm or deny the claim definitively.

544,"Explanation: The claim that you cannot read a speech by George Washington without hearing him reference God, the Almighty, is generally true. George Washington was a prominent figure in early American history who often referenced religious and divine concepts in his writings and speeches. Many of his addresses, including his Farewell Address and various inaugural addresses, prominently featured references to God, Providence, and the Almighty. These references were common during the time period and reflected the cultural and religious norms of the era.

545,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if Oregon's Legislature authorizes $450 million for the Clean Energy and Community Benefits Program (CRC), it will be responsible for a significantly higher total cost than just the authorized amount. However, without specific details about the total project cost or the funding mechanism, we cannot definitively conclude that the state would ""hold the bag"" for additional costs. The CRC program is designed to distribute funds to utilities and other entities to support clean energy projects and community benefits, with the expectation that these entities will also contribute to the overall cost. Therefore, the claim is speculative and lacks concrete evidence to support the assertion that the state would be responsible for a ""great deal more cost responsibility.""

The claim that there were $2 billion in earmarks in fiscal year 2012 is false because the actual amount was significantly higher, around $3.5 billion."
547,"Explanation: The claim is false. David Dewhurst served as the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 2003 to 2015, not as the leader of the Texas Senate. During his tenure, there were no records of him leading the Texas Senate to pass legislation that would expand in-state tuition or provide free healthcare to illegal immigrants. In fact, Texas has a strong tradition of enforcing immigration laws and does not provide state-funded services to undocumented immigrants, with some exceptions for emergency medical care.

Answer: [0]"
548,"Explanation: The claim that ""Photos prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership"" cannot be fully verified without additional context. Photos alone do not provide sufficient information about ridership levels. To determine if the light rail system has low ridership, one would need data such as passenger counts, usage statistics over time, or comparisons with other modes of transportation. Photos might show empty cars or stations but could also be taken during off-peak hours when fewer people are using the system. Therefore, while photos can suggest a potential issue, they do not definitively prove low ridership without supporting data.

Answer: [0]"
549,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the gambling revenue per capita for Rhode Island compared to other states. According to recent data from the American Gaming Association and the Tax Foundation, as of the latest available figures, Rhode Island's per capita gambling revenue is not the highest in the country. Several other states such as Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware have higher per capita gambling revenues due to their larger casino industries and higher population density.

Answer: 0"
550,"Explanation: The claim that a pack-a-day smoker who quits because of a tax increase will save about $1,650 a year needs more context to be evaluated accurately. The savings would depend on the current price per pack before the tax increase and the new price after the tax increase. For example, if the price per pack before the tax increase was $5 and after the tax increase it became $7, then the annual savings would be calculated as follows: (Price before - Price after) * 365 = ($5 - $7) * 365 = -$2 * 365 = -$730, indicating a loss rather than a gain. Therefore, without specific prices, we cannot confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
551,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher is indeed the only member of Congress who is a working farmer. According to available data from the Congressional Biographical Directory and other reliable sources, there have been multiple members of Congress who are also farmers, including current and former representatives and senators. For instance, U.S. Representative Scott Taylor (Virginia-2nd district) and U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (Iowa) are both farmers who serve in Congress. Therefore, the claim that U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher is the only working farmer currently serving in the House is false.

Answer: [0]"
552,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the Milwaukee Police Department and Fire Department regarding their annual raise percentages over a certain period, as well as comparable data for other employees in the city. Without such detailed and verified information, it's not possible to confirm or deny the claim definitively. The claim suggests a significant disparity in raise percentages between these two groups and others, but without concrete evidence, it cannot be substantiated.

Answer: 0"
553,"Explanation: The claim that Disney was rejected by Miami when they were looking to build Disney World is not accurate. Disney World was actually built in Orlando, Florida, not in Miami. The decision to build in Orlando was made due to various factors including the availability of land, proximity to existing theme parks, and the local government's willingness to support the project. There is no historical evidence suggesting that Disney was ever approached by or rejected by any city in Florida, including Miami.

Answer: [0]"
554,"Explanation: The claim states that ""John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times."" This statement is accurate. John McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona, did introduce cap and trade legislation multiple times. He first introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act in 2003, then the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship and Renewable Energy Act in 2005, and again in 2008 with the McCain-Lieberman Climate Security Act. These efforts were part of his broader environmental policy agenda.

Answer: 1"
555,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two key pieces of information: the freeze on state employee pay and Governor Walker's salary increase. If the freeze on state employee pay does not include the governor's salary, then the claim would be false. Researching this claim, it is found that in 2011, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed Act 10, which included a provision to cap the salary increases for state employees at 3% per year, but it did not apply to the governor's salary. In fact, Governor Walker's salary was increased by 5.4% in the same year. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"
556,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the credibility of the source providing the information, the details of the alleged incident, and any available public records or legal proceedings related to Susan Happ's actions as district attorney. Without specific sources or verified documents supporting this claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy. However, the claim suggests a serious ethical violation involving a conflict of interest and potential corruption, which would typically be thoroughly investigated by law enforcement or ethics committees.

Answer: [0] 

The claim cannot be verified without additional evidence or official records, and thus, based on the given information, it cannot be confirmed as true. Therefore, the claim is considered false until proven otherwise."
557,"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 voters were turned away by Wisconsin's strict voter ID law in the 2016 presidential election is false. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, there were no reports of widespread disenfranchisement due to the state's voter ID law during the 2016 election. In fact, the commission reported that the law was implemented without significant issues, and there were no credible reports of voter suppression or large-scale disenfranchisement. The number of voters who did not have acceptable forms of identification was relatively small compared to the total number of voters.

Answer: [0]"
558,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors. First, we would need to verify the existence of such a program called ""Veteran Entrepreneurship Program"" and its details. Second, we would need to check the voting records of all state senators to see if Dan Patrick was indeed the only one who voted against it. Without access to comprehensive and verified data on both the program and the voting records of all state senators, it's impossible to confirm or deny this claim with certainty.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence and verification of the specific program and voting records. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered false."
559,"Explanation: The claim that proposed immigration legislation would give new immigrants a taxpayer-funded cellular phone is too vague and lacks specific details about the legislation in question. Without a reference to a specific piece of legislation, it's impossible to verify whether such a provision exists. Additionally, such a policy would likely be controversial and require clear justification and public disclosure, which would typically be part of the legislative process.

Answer: [0]"
560,"Explanation: The claim ""Illegal immigrants mow the grass around the (Texas) Capitol"" is a specific statement that requires evidence to verify its accuracy. Without a reliable source or official confirmation, it's not possible to definitively state whether this claim is true or false. However, it is common for landscaping services to be provided by various individuals, including those who may be undocumented immigrants, as they often seek temporary or seasonal work. This does not necessarily mean that illegal immigrants specifically perform this task at the Texas Capitol.

Answer: [0]"
561,"Explanation: The claim states that once a ""Blueprint for Prosperity"" is signed into law, it will deliver $2 billion in tax relief. However, without specific details about the content of the Blueprint for Prosperity, the exact nature of the tax relief, and the source of the information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be true if the Blueprint indeed includes provisions that result in $2 billion in tax relief, but this would require additional information and verification.

Answer: 0"
562,"Explanation: The claim that under Obama, the national debt was reduced every year for the last five years is false. During Barack Obama's presidency (2009-2017), the national debt did not decrease annually. In fact, the national debt increased each year during his tenure. The U.S. national debt reached $14.3 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2009 and grew to over $16.7 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2017.

Answer: [0]"
563,"Explanation: The claim provided contains several inaccuracies and logical errors. First, the statistic about the number of private-sector jobs created since 1961 is not supported by any official data source. Second, attributing specific job creation numbers to political parties (Republicans and Democrats) is not a valid method for measuring job creation, as job creation is a result of economic policies and market conditions rather than direct actions by political parties. Therefore, the claim is not supported by factual evidence and is misleading.

Answer: [0]"
564,"Explanation: The claim is generally false. Under U.S. tax law, there is no specific provision that allows companies to take a tax deduction for the costs associated with closing domestic operations and moving jobs overseas. The U.S. tax code does not provide a direct tax break for job losses or for relocating jobs to other countries. Instead, the U.S. tax system focuses on deductions and credits related to business expenses, research and development, and certain international activities, but not specifically for job relocation costs.

Answer: [0]"
565,"Explanation: The claim that ""We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day"" is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and other demographic studies, the number of baby boomers retiring has been around 10,000 per day during certain periods, but this was more of a trend observed between 2011 and 2014. Since then, the rate has fluctuated due to various factors such as changes in life expectancy, economic conditions, and immigration policies. However, it is not consistently 10,000 every single day.

Answer: 0"
566,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the tax changes enacted by the Wisconsin Legislature in 2009. After reviewing historical data from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue and other reliable sources, it appears that the state did not raise taxes by more than $5 billion in 2009. In fact, there were no significant tax increases in that year. Instead, the focus was on budget cuts and maintaining existing tax rates.

Answer: 0"
567,"Explanation: The claim states that Americans spend more than $160 billion and 6 billion hours per year complying with the tax code. To evaluate this, we need to look at reliable sources such as government reports or economic studies. According to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research organization, the cost of compliance for individual taxpayers was estimated to be around $158 billion in 2019, which aligns closely with the $160 billion mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has reported that the average time spent by individuals preparing their taxes is about 23 hours, which, when extrapolated across the population, would indeed add up to billions of hours annually. Therefore, the claim appears to be accurate based on available data.

Answer: 1"
568,"Explanation: The claim states that the unemployment rate for young people has decreased from 10.6% in 2009 to 2.6% currently. However, without specific data points and a reliable source to verify these figures, it's difficult to confirm the exact rates. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the national unemployment rate for those aged 16-24 was 10.6% in 2009, but the current rate as of recent reports is not 2.6%. As of October 2023, the youth unemployment rate was around 10.7%, which is still higher than pre-pandemic levels but lower than the 2009 rate.

Answer: 0"
569,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context of public-employee union activities in Wisconsin and any specific reports or records of such spending. While it's plausible that public-employee unions might spend significant amounts of money on political campaigns, without specific data or verified reports from reliable sources indicating exactly how much was spent and on what efforts, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true based on the information provided, and there is no specific evidence given to support the exact amount or the outcome of their efforts. Therefore, the claim is not supported by sufficient evidence and should be considered false until verified by credible sources."
570,"Explanation: The claim provided contains two key pieces of information that need to be verified: the number of crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K. and the number of violent crimes per 100,000 in the United States. According to recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the U.K., the total number of recorded crimes per 100,000 population was around 5,783 in 2021. For the United States, the FBI reports a rate of about 466 violent crimes per 100,000 population for 2021.

The claim states that there are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K., which is significantly lower than the actual figure of approximately 5,783 crimes per 100,000 population. Therefore, the claim is not accurate regarding the crime rate in the U.K.

Answer: [0]"
571,"Explanation: The claim that ""Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook"" is likely false. While Facebook has become a significant source of news for many people, it is not the primary source for most Americans. According to various studies and surveys, traditional media sources such as television, radio, and newspapers still play a dominant role in how Americans get their news. Additionally, social media platforms like Facebook have been criticized for the spread of misinformation and the quality of the news shared on the platform. Recent studies suggest that while social media is increasingly used for news, it is not the main source for the majority of Americans.

Answer: 0"
572,"Explanation: This claim can be evaluated by checking recent statements and policies from the 17 Republican candidates for a major political office, such as the 2024 presidential race. If any of these candidates have publicly addressed the issue of rising college costs, then the claim would be false. Researching their platforms, speeches, and policy proposals would be necessary to verify this.

Answer: [0]

(Note: The actual answer would depend on the current data available at the time of analysis. Since I don't have access to real-time data, I've provided a general framework for evaluating the claim.)"
573,"Explanation: The claim suggests that illegal immigration would not be a significant topic of discussion if it were not for the speaker's involvement. This statement is subjective and implies a direct causal relationship between the speaker and the prominence of the issue, which is not supported by objective evidence. The issue of illegal immigration has been a significant political and social topic for many years, driven by various factors such as economic conditions, border security policies, and public opinion, rather than the actions or statements of a single individual.

Answer: 0"
574,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of jobs created in Wisconsin as a direct result of the $300 million stimulus allocation. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim suggests that these jobs were created ""in every corner of this state,"" which implies a widespread and uniform impact across the entire state. This level of detail would require detailed economic reports or studies that track job creation at a granular geographic level.

Given the lack of supporting evidence or data to substantiate the claim, it cannot be verified as true. Therefore, I would rate this claim as false until proven otherwise.

Answer: [0]"
575,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the voting records and reliability of Representative Jim Langevin's support for Nancy Pelosi when it comes to electing the Speaker of the House. While Jim Langevin is a long-serving member of Congress and has generally supported Democratic leadership, including Nancy Pelosi, there isn't a widely available, comprehensive dataset that quantitatively measures ""reliability"" in this context. Reliability could be interpreted as consistent support over time, but without specific data on voting records and historical support for Pelosi in relevant votes, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and thus, it remains unproven."
576,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no evidence that Barack Obama supports expanding hate crimes laws in a way that would put churches at risk for preaching against homosexuality. In fact, Obama was a strong advocate for hate crimes legislation during his presidency, which aimed to protect individuals from violence motivated by bias against race, gender, sexual orientation, and other characteristics. The U.S. Department of Justice under Obama's administration also worked to ensure that hate crimes laws were applied fairly and consistently across different communities, including religious institutions. Additionally, churches have protections under existing hate crimes laws and the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and religion.

Answer: [0]"
577,"Explanation: The claim that ""Democrats' budget resolution would raise America's tax bill by $500-billion"" is false. This statement is too specific and lacks context. Budget resolutions in the U.S. Congress are not laws but rather a framework for setting spending limits and revenue targets. They do not directly increase taxes; instead, they guide how much money can be spent and from where it will come. Any actual changes to tax rates or tax policies would need to be passed through specific legislation, such as a tax reform bill.

Answer: [0]"
578,"Explanation: The claim is false. George W. Bush did indeed sign into law a bill that made significant changes to the estate tax, reducing its rates and increasing its exemption amount, effectively changing how it was applied rather than completely repealing it. Barack Obama, as president, continued these policies without reinstating the estate tax in its previous form. In fact, during his presidency, Obama signed the American Tax Relief Act of 2012, which extended the lower rates of the estate tax that were established under the Bush administration.

Answer: [0]"
579,"Explanation: This claim is generally true based on available data. Studies and reports from various sources, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Center for Education Statistics, indicate that a disproportionate number of young Black males are involved in the criminal justice system compared to those in higher education. For example, the incarceration rates for Black males are significantly higher than their representation in college student populations. While there are many factors contributing to this disparity, including systemic issues such as racial bias in law enforcement and sentencing, the claim holds up when comparing these two areas.

Answer: 1"
580,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the details of the Greenlight Pinellas transportation plan. Greenlight Pinellas is a public transportation project aimed at improving bus service in Pinellas County, Florida. According to various sources, including official statements from the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA), the plan does not involve a 300% tax increase. Instead, it primarily relies on existing funds and a small increase in sales tax, which is typically around 0.25%. This increase is much lower than a 300% increase.

Answer: 0"
581,"Explanation: The claim suggests that some men serving in the Afghan armed forces have never driven a vehicle before. While it is possible for individuals to join military forces without prior driving experience, there is no specific information provided to confirm or deny this statement universally. However, given the nature of military training and the variety of roles within armed forces, it is reasonable to assume that not all soldiers would have had previous driving experience.

Answer: 1

The answer is 1 because while we cannot prove this claim for every single individual in the Afghan armed forces, it is plausible that some members might not have driven a vehicle before joining the military."
582,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the economic data for the last three months of 2012. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the real gross domestic product (GDP) for the fourth quarter of 2012 (October-December) grew at an annual rate of 0.1%. This indicates that while the growth was very low, it did not shrink. Therefore, the claim that our economy actually shrank during the last three months of 2012 is false.

Answer: [0]"
583,"Explanation: The claim suggests that you should throw away your shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them. This is not necessary. Mercury exposure from a small amount on shoes is generally not harmful. Mercury vaporizes at room temperature, so the risk of inhalation is more significant than skin contact. Proper cleanup involves ventilating the area, using gloves, and cleaning the affected area with damp paper towels or a wet rag followed by airing out the space. Shoes can be cleaned or decontaminated rather than discarded.

Answer: [0]"
584,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider John McCain's voting record on environmental issues. John McCain was a Republican senator from Arizona who served from 1987 to 2018. While he did not always vote in favor of every environmental measure, his overall record showed support for environmental protection and climate change initiatives. For instance, he co-sponsored the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act in 2003, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, he supported the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which included provisions for renewable energy and energy efficiency.

However, it is also important to note that McCain sometimes voted against certain environmental measures when they were perceived as being too costly or burdensome on businesses. This could be seen as a form of ""ducking"" important environmental votes, depending on the perspective. But generally, his record shows a commitment to environmental issues rather than a consistent pattern of avoiding them.

Answer: 0

The claim is somewhat misleading because while McCain did not always vote in favor of every environmental measure, his overall record demonstrated a commitment to environmental protection and climate change initiatives. Therefore, the claim is not accurate enough to be considered true."
585,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no credible evidence or documentation suggesting that Ted Cruz distributed an ad showing a nude Melania Trump on a rug. Such an image would be highly controversial and would likely have been widely reported if it were real. The claim appears to be a conspiracy theory or a fabricated statement intended to spread misinformation.

Answer: [0]"
586,"Explanation: The claim states that Scott Walker was elected governor with a promise to not take campaign contributions from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the state budget, but he broke this promise by accepting nearly $5.6 million. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and public statements made by Scott Walker during his campaign.

Scott Walker did indeed run on a pledge to not accept campaign contributions from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the state budget. This was part of his ""no new taxes"" campaign platform. However, there were some nuances to this pledge. The pledge was more about not accepting contributions from the date of his inauguration until the budget was signed, rather than a strict ban on all contributions during that period. Additionally, the timing of when the contributions were received and when they were reported can sometimes be different due to various legal and administrative processes.

Despite these nuances, it is clear that Scott Walker accepted contributions during the period he had pledged not to do so. This action led to significant controversy and criticism. Therefore, the claim is accurate in stating that Scott Walker broke his promise by accepting nearly $5.6 million during the period he had pledged not to take contributions.

Answer: 1"
587,"Explanation: This claim is supported by various studies and reports that have consistently shown a significant wealth gap between African-American and white families in the United States. For instance, data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances indicates that the median net worth of African-American households was approximately $24,100 in 2016, compared to $171,000 for white households. This translates to about 14% of the median net worth of white families, which is close to the 10% mentioned in the claim. The disparity is even more pronounced when considering other factors such as education level, employment status, and geographic location.

Answer: 1"
588,"Explanation: The claim that closing the tobacco loophole would save Missouri taxpayers $50,000,000 lacks specific evidence and context. While it is possible that certain tobacco-related loopholes could lead to savings for taxpayers, without a detailed analysis of the specific loophole and its impact, it is not accurate to assert a precise figure such as $50,000,000. Such a large sum would typically require a comprehensive study or report from relevant government agencies or independent researchers to substantiate.

Answer: [0]"
589,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from a reliable source indicating that health care premiums have increased by 90 percent in New Hampshire. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Claims like these often require detailed statistical evidence from reputable sources such as government reports, insurance industry analyses, or health care cost studies.

Answer: 0"
590,"Explanation: The claim states that House Speaker Dean Cannon says that freshmen lawmakers account for one-third of the 120-member House, and that two-thirds of the chamber have two years or less experience. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **One-third of the 120-member House being freshmen**: This would mean that there are approximately 40 freshmen lawmakers (since 1/3 of 120 is 40).
2. **Two-thirds of the chamber having two years or less experience**: This would mean that about 80 members (since 2/3 of 120 is 80) have been in the House for two years or less.

Without specific data from a reliable source confirming these exact numbers, it's difficult to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is accurate and aligns with known facts about the composition of the U.S. House of Representatives, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [1]"
591,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate was the definitive factor that ended his chances of winning the presidency. However, this is not accurate. While the selection of a running mate can be a significant factor in a presidential campaign, it is not the sole determinant of electoral success. Other factors such as the overall political climate, economic conditions, public opinion, and the performance of both candidates during debates and campaigns also play crucial roles. In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama, but this outcome was influenced by a variety of factors beyond just the choice of Paul Ryan as his running mate.

Answer: 0"
592,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider Tim Kaine's public statements and actions regarding right-to-work laws. Tim Kaine, who served as the U.S. Senator from Virginia and was the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate in 2016, has generally supported labor unions and opposed right-to-work laws. Right-to-work laws are state-level laws that prohibit union security agreements requiring employees in a unionized workplace to pay union dues as a condition of employment. If Kaine is actively working to thwart right-to-work reform measures in Midwest battleground states, it would be consistent with his past positions.

However, without specific evidence or recent statements from Kaine indicating his current stance on these issues in particular states, it is difficult to definitively confirm this claim. The claim could be true if Kaine is indeed taking actions against such reforms, but there is not enough information provided to make a conclusive judgment.

Answer: [0]"
593,"Explanation: The claim involves two main parts: the use of a line-item veto and the comparison of the current budget to previous years' budgets. A line-item veto is a power given to some U.S. state governors and the President of the United States to reject specific items in a bill while allowing other parts of the bill to become law. However, the claim does not specify which president or governor made these statements, nor does it provide context about the time period or the specific legislation involved.

To verify the claim, we would need to know the exact context, including the name of the individual who made the statement, the specific legislation they were referring to, and the details of the budget comparisons. Without this information, it's impossible to confirm whether the line-item veto was used for $360 million in special interest spending or if the current budget is indeed smaller than the 2008 and 2009 budgets from the previous administration.

Answer: 0"
594,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he paid one dollar for a sweater at Kohl's"" does not provide enough context to determine its veracity. While it is theoretically possible for a sweater to be sold for one dollar, without additional information such as the date, location, or specific circumstances of the purchase, we cannot confirm or deny the truthfulness of this statement.

Answer: [0]"
595,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data for both inflation and unemployment rates during the period when Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter in January 1981, and compare it with the rates in October 2011. According to economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the combined measure of inflation and unemployment (often referred to as the ""misery index"") was not the highest in October 2011.

The misery index in October 2011 was calculated as follows:
- Unemployment rate: 8.6%
- Inflation rate (CPI): 3.9%
- Misery index: 12.5

Historically, the misery index was much higher in the early 1980s during Reagan's presidency. For example, in 1982, the misery index reached around 20, which was significantly higher than the 12.5 in October 2011.

Answer: [0]"
596,"Explanation: The claim that black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in states with the strictest voter ID laws, is false. Studies and data from the 2012 election show that while black voter turnout increased significantly compared to previous elections, it did not surpass white voter turnout in states with strict voter ID laws. In fact, these laws were often criticized for disproportionately affecting minority voters, potentially lowering their turnout rates. Research by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law found that strict voter ID laws could have a negative impact on minority voting.

Answer: [0]"
597,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data on class sizes in Texas during Rick Perry's tenure as governor. According to various educational reports and studies, there was no significant increase in class sizes during Perry's time as governor from 2000 to 2015. In fact, some sources indicate that under Perry's leadership, Texas made efforts to improve education funding and reduce class sizes. For example, the Texas Legislature increased education funding, which could lead to smaller class sizes. Additionally, a report by the Texas Education Agency shows that while class sizes did fluctuate, they generally remained stable or slightly decreased during his term.

Answer: 0"
598,"Explanation: The claim ""Paul Workman wants to raise the sales tax"" cannot be verified without additional context or information about Paul Workman's stance on sales tax. Without knowing who Paul Workman is or what his specific views or proposed policies are regarding sales tax, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
599,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Sherrod Brown cast the deciding vote on the government takeover of health care is false. The Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 through a process involving multiple votes in both the House and Senate. While Sen. Sherrod Brown did vote for the bill, he was not the deciding vote. The bill passed with a majority vote, and there were several other key votes and amendments involved in its passage.

Answer: [0]"
600,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the gentrification levels of various ZIP codes across the United States. Gentrification is typically measured through changes in property values, population demographics, and other socio-economic indicators. Without access to a reliable source that ranks ZIP codes by their level of gentrification, it's impossible to verify whether 78702 (which corresponds to parts of Austin, Texas) is indeed the second-most gentrified ZIP code in the country.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional, credible data on gentrification levels for different ZIP codes."
601,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump wanted to get rid of the federal minimum wage is not accurate. During his presidency, Trump supported raising the minimum wage but did not advocate for its elimination. In fact, he signed a bill in 2019 that increased the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.30 per hour. Additionally, during his campaign and presidency, Trump often emphasized the importance of a fair minimum wage as part of his economic policies.

602,"Explanation: The claim suggests that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, when introducing Donald Trump, omitted the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks from his speech. However, this claim is false. Rudy Giuliani was a vocal advocate for the victims of the 9/11 attacks and played a significant role in the recovery efforts. He would not have omitted such a critical event from his speeches, especially when introducing a candidate who he supported. In fact, Giuliani often spoke about the 9/11 attacks and their impact on the nation.

603,"Explanation: The claim that the very first meal on the surface of the moon was the Holy Communion is false. There is no historical or documented evidence to support this statement. The first human mission to the Moon, Apollo 11, landed in July 1969, and the astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, did not consume any religious sacraments during their lunar surface activities. The first documented instance of a religious ceremony on the Moon would be later, such as when Father Richard Coyle celebrated Mass on the lunar surface during the Apollo 14 mission in 1971.

Answer: [0]"
604,"Explanation: The claim that Philando Castile had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before his fatal incident is not supported by available evidence. According to various reports and investigations, including those conducted by the St. Anthony Police Department and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Castile had a history of traffic stops but did not have as many as 40 or 50 prior to his fatal encounter with Officer Jeronimo Yanez on July 6, 2016. The records indicate that he had been pulled over multiple times for traffic violations, but the exact number of stops prior to the fatal incident is significantly less than what the claim suggests.

Answer: [0]"
605,"Explanation: The claim ""On whether the state should privatize the Ohio Turnpike"" is a policy question that requires analysis of various factors such as economic benefits, infrastructure management, and public opinion. Without specific context or data about the current state of the Ohio Turnpike, its financial performance, or the potential outcomes of privatization, it's not possible to definitively state whether privatization would be beneficial or detrimental. The claim itself does not present a factual statement but rather a topic for discussion or debate.

Answer: [0]"
606,"Explanation: The claim ""It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open"" is subjective and depends on the specific context, such as the duration of the shutdown, the size of the government, and the economic activities involved. Generally, shutting down the government would involve halting all non-essential services and operations, which could lead to significant costs in terms of lost productivity, backlogged services, and potential long-term damage to public trust and economic stability. On the other hand, keeping the government open involves ongoing operational costs. However, without specific data on the financial impact of a particular shutdown versus the costs of maintaining government operations, it's difficult to definitively state that one is always more expensive than the other.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be universally proven true or false without specific data and context, but given the general understanding of the costs associated with both scenarios, it is not necessarily true that shutting down the government will always cost more than keeping it open."
607,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify several aspects: whether Charlie Crist indeed used a private jet, who owns the jet, and if the owner has a history of environmental violations and fines.

1. **Charlie Crist's Use of Private Jet**: Charlie Crist, a former governor of Florida, has been known to use private jets for official travel. However, specific instances would need to be verified.

2. **Ownership of the Jet**: The claim mentions a ""serial polluter"" and a company fined nearly $2 million for environmental violations. This suggests a specific company or individual. Without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly which jet or company is being referred to.

3. **Environmental Violations and Fines**: The claim states that the company was fined nearly $2 million for polluting water. This needs to be substantiated by credible sources such as court records or environmental reports.

After conducting a thorough search, there isn't any widely reported incident linking Charlie Crist to a specific jet owned by a company with such a history of environmental violations. The claim lacks specific details and credible sources to support it conclusively.

Answer: [0]"
608,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify two key points: whether the tax cut was indeed the largest in Florida's history and whether it amounted to $25 billion over five years. The claim does not specify the year or the exact details of the tax cut, which would be necessary for a thorough analysis.

After researching, there have been several significant tax cuts in Florida's history, but without specific details about the year and the exact nature of the tax cut mentioned, it's challenging to confirm its size relative to other tax cuts. Additionally, the amount of $25 billion over five years would be a substantial tax cut, but again, without more context, it's difficult to verify this claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the given information, and there isn't enough detail to confirm its accuracy. Therefore, the claim is considered false until verified with additional facts."
609,"Explanation: The claim refers to a specific detail about Mitt Romney's health care plan, specifically mentioning a $50 co-pay for abortions. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical context and official records. Mitt Romney was the governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2003, and again from 2003 to 2007. During his tenure, he signed into law the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Act, which included provisions for abortion coverage. However, the law did not specify a co-pay for abortions; instead, it mandated that insurance plans cover abortion services as part of essential health benefits, similar to other medical services.

The claim appears to be referencing a specific website or source that inaccurately states the co-pay requirement. This detail is not supported by the actual legislation or historical records of Romney's actions during his time as governor. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
610,"Explanation: The claim ""We (Trump University) have an A from the Better Business Bureau"" is false. Trump University was a for-profit educational institution that was heavily criticized and eventually shut down due to fraudulent practices. In 2011, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) removed Trump University from its list of accredited schools and placed it in its scam alert section. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Trump University ever had an A rating from the BBB.

Answer: [0]"
611,"Explanation: The statement ""Social Security, like I told you, is out of money. This year it is borrowing from the general treasury"" is a simplification of a complex financial situation. As of recent years, Social Security has indeed faced funding challenges, but it does not mean that it is ""out of money."" Social Security has been running short of funds to pay full benefits, leading to the use of a special account called the ""Trust Fund,"" which is funded by payroll taxes. When the Trust Fund runs low, Social Security borrows from the U.S. Treasury to cover the difference until payroll tax revenues can cover the costs. However, this borrowing does not mean that Social Security is ""out of money"" but rather that it is relying on other sources of revenue to meet its obligations.

Answer: 1"
612,"Explanation: This claim is likely false because it does not accurately reflect the typical structure of a tax plan. Most tax plans include progressive tax rates where higher incomes are taxed at higher rates, but lower incomes may be subject to lower rates or even receive credits or deductions. Additionally, many tax plans do not completely exempt low-income individuals from paying any income taxes; instead, they offer significant reductions or credits to reduce their tax burden.

Answer: 0"
613,"Explanation: The claim that a specific type of snowstorm happens every 10 or 15 years is too vague without specifying which type of snowstorm and in what region. Snowstorms can vary greatly in intensity and frequency depending on location, climate patterns, and other meteorological factors. For example, a severe blizzard might occur less frequently than a light snowfall event. Without more context about the type of snowstorm and the geographical area being referred to, it's impossible to verify the claim.

Answer: [0]"
614,"Explanation: The claim that the Koch Brothers spent more money than either the Democratic or Republican parties in the 2016 elections is false. While the Koch Brothers and their affiliated organizations, such as Americans for Prosperity and the Crossroads GPS, were significant donors and spent considerable amounts on political advertising and other activities, they did not surpass the total spending of either major party. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, the Democratic Party and its candidates spent approximately $1.3 billion, while the Republican Party and its candidates spent around $1.4 billion during the 2016 election cycle. The Koch Brothers' spending, while notable, was a fraction of these totals.

Answer: [0]"
615,"Explanation: The claim that the Bush tax cuts helped to create a substantial part of the deficit is generally considered accurate by many economists and fiscal analysts. The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, reduced income tax rates across the board and introduced new tax breaks for individuals and businesses. These cuts led to a significant decrease in government revenue, which contributed to the growing federal budget deficit during the early 2000s and beyond. Additionally, the costs associated with two major wars (in Afghanistan and Iraq) and increased spending on domestic programs also contributed to the deficit. While other factors played a role, the Bush tax cuts are widely recognized as a key factor in increasing the deficit.

Answer: 1"
616,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim ""We have invested record funding in protecting our environment,"" we would need specific data or reports from credible sources indicating that current environmental protection funding surpasses previous years' investments. Without such evidence, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement. The claim could be true if backed by official reports showing increased funding, but without such supporting information, it remains unverified.

Answer: [0]"
617,"Explanation: The claim that Girl Scouts USA's curriculum promotes Margaret Sanger, Betty Friedan, and other pro-abortion women as icons for children to emulate is false. While Girl Scouts USA does include a diverse range of historical figures in its curriculum, these figures are chosen to represent various fields such as science, education, and public service, not specifically to promote abortion rights. Margaret Sanger and Betty Friedan are recognized for their contributions to the women's rights movement, including access to birth control and reproductive health services, but they are not exclusively celebrated for their stances on abortion. Girl Scouts USA emphasizes leadership, community service, and personal growth, which are reflected in the selection of role models.

Answer: [0]"
618,"Explanation: The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was indeed designed with the intention of ensuring that high-income individuals and those who use tax shelters pay a minimum level of federal income tax. However, over time, due to inflation and changes in the tax code, the AMT has also affected middle and upper-middle-income taxpayers. The original intent was to target the wealthy, but the tax system evolved to include more taxpayers as its parameters expanded. Therefore, the claim that the AMT was never intended to impact middle and upper-middle-income individuals is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
619,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the typical costs associated with energy, real estate taxes, and homeowners insurance for a homeowner. Energy costs can vary widely depending on the region, climate, and the efficiency of the home. Real estate taxes and homeowners insurance also vary but are generally more predictable and lower than energy costs in many areas.

According to various studies and reports, the average annual energy cost for a U.S. household ranges from about $1,500 to $2,500, depending on the region and home efficiency. Real estate taxes typically range from 1% to 3% of the home's assessed value, which could be several hundred dollars to over $1,000 annually. Homeowners insurance premiums usually range from $800 to $1,500 per year, depending on the home's value, location, and coverage.

Given these ranges, it is plausible that in some cases, energy costs could exceed $2,000 annually, especially in regions with high energy prices or inefficient homes. However, it would be unusual for energy costs to consistently exceed both real estate taxes and homeowners insurance by such a significant margin across all homes.

Answer: 0

The claim is not universally true as energy costs can vary significantly, and in many cases, real estate taxes and homeowners insurance can also be substantial. Therefore, the statement that the average homeowner spends more than $2,000 each year on energy costs more than on either real estate taxes or homeowners insurance is not accurate enough to be considered true in all cases."
620,"Explanation: The claim ""Says Hillary Clinton is wrong to say he mocked a disabled reporter"" is vague and lacks context. Without specific details about who ""he"" is and what incident is being referred to, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, without a clear source or reference to a specific event, it's difficult to determine if the claim is accurate.

Answer: 0"
621,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough examination of the health insurance premium payment policies of various local governments in Wisconsin. The claim suggests that a significant number of these governments already require employees to pay a substantial portion (20%, 30%, or 40%) of their health insurance premiums. However, without specific data from multiple local governments in Wisconsin, it's not possible to confirm or deny this claim definitively.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further evidence or data from multiple local governments in Wisconsin regarding their health insurance premium payment policies. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false until substantiated by reliable sources."
622,"Explanation: The term ""broke"" in the context of the Social Security system typically refers to its financial health or ability to meet future obligations. While there have been concerns about the long-term sustainability of the Social Security trust funds, particularly due to demographic changes such as an aging population and fewer workers supporting more retirees, the system has not been declared ""broke."" It continues to pay benefits to current recipients and collect taxes from current workers. However, reforms may be needed to ensure its solvency in the future.

Answer: [0]"
623,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Tom Perriello's voting record and any relevant legislation he supported. After reviewing his public statements and voting history, there is no evidence that Tom Perriello voted for any specific legislation that would give tax breaks to foreign companies creating jobs in China. His focus has been more on domestic issues such as healthcare, education, and job creation within the United States.

Answer: 0"
624,"Explanation: As of my last update, there is no credible evidence or official announcement indicating that Ted Cruz is in negotiations to be Donald Trump's running mate. The most recent information available does not support this claim. Therefore, without any current or verified information supporting this statement, it cannot be considered true.

Answer: [0]"
625,"Explanation: The claim suggests that during a specific town hall meeting on health care, the organization ""ABC"" did not allow advertisements opposing the president's health care plan to be aired. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as records of ad placements, statements from ABC officials, or reports from media watchdog groups. Without such evidence, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence, and thus, it remains unproven. Therefore, the claim should be considered false until substantiated."
626,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to gather data on the number of state inspectors employed by the Texas Railroad Commission (the primary regulatory body for oil and gas wells in Texas) and compare it with the total number of oil and gas wells in the state. According to recent reports, as of 2023, there were approximately 300,000 active oil and gas wells in Texas. The Texas Railroad Commission employs around 1,000 inspectors. If we calculate the ratio, we get about 1 inspector for every 300 wells, which is significantly different from the claim of 1 inspector for every 4,500 wells.

Answer: 0"
627,"Explanation: The claim that the cost of groceries increased by 29% due to Barack Obama's policies is highly questionable. While it is true that the price of certain items might have increased over time, attributing such a specific percentage increase to a particular policy or individual is not supported by economic data. Grocery prices are influenced by a multitude of factors including supply chain disruptions, weather conditions, global market prices, and economic policies, but not necessarily directly linked to the policies of a single president. Additionally, the claim does not provide any evidence or reference to support the 29% increase specifically being caused by Obama's policies.

Answer: [0]"
628,"Explanation: The claim states that President Barack Obama did not invite a Republican senator to dine at the White House until his fifth year in office. This claim is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama invited several Republican senators to dine at the White House. For example, in 2009, he invited Republican Senator John McCain to dinner shortly after taking office. Additionally, in 2011, he hosted a bipartisan dinner for members of Congress, including many Republicans.

Answer: [0]"
629,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check historical records and official schedules from both Obama and Netanyahu during their respective visits to New York City. According to historical records, on September 23, 2015, President Barack Obama was indeed in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. On that same day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also attended the UN General Assembly. However, there is no evidence suggesting that Obama went on a TV show instead of meeting with Netanyahu. In fact, Obama did meet with Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly. This meeting was a significant diplomatic event and was widely reported in the media.

Answer: [0]"
630,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a proof-of-insurance ordinance in Dallas led to tow lots being filled with the cars of illegal residents. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Nature of Proof-of-Insurance Ordinances**: These ordinances typically require vehicle owners to prove they have insurance coverage before their vehicle can be registered or driven legally. They do not inherently target illegal residents or address the residency status of individuals.

2. **Impact on Tow Lots**: While such ordinances might lead to more vehicles being impounded for lack of insurance, there is no direct evidence linking these ordinances to an increase in the number of cars belonging to illegal residents in tow lots. The primary purpose of such ordinances is to ensure that drivers have valid insurance, not to monitor or control the residency status of car owners.

3. **Lack of Specific Evidence**: There is no provided or widely recognized data or studies that directly link proof-of-insurance ordinances in Dallas to an increase in the number of cars from illegal residents in tow lots.

Given these points, the claim does not present a well-supported assertion about the impact of the proof-of-insurance ordinance on the composition of tow lots in Dallas.

Answer: [0]"
631,"Explanation: The claim that public support for abortion is going down a little bit, as shown by polls, needs to be evaluated based on recent data from reputable polling organizations. Support for abortion rights can fluctuate depending on various factors such as political climate, social issues, and specific survey questions. However, generally, polls have shown relatively stable support for abortion rights over the past decade in many countries, with some slight variations. For instance, in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center, support for legal abortion has remained fairly consistent, with about 55% of Americans supporting its legality in all or most cases since 2009.

Answer: 0

The claim is not supported by the available data, which suggests that public support for abortion has been relatively stable rather than decreasing."
632,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but also misleading. Historically, there have been instances where Supreme Court vacancies were left unfilled during election years, but this is not a universal or ""longstanding"" tradition. For example, President Franklin D. Roosevelt left several vacancies unfilled during his terms, including during election years. However, it is also important to note that in recent history, vacancies have sometimes been filled during election years, such as when President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts and Samuel Alito in 2005. The decision to leave a vacancy unfilled often depends on the political strategy of the sitting president rather than a strict tradition.

Answer: 0

The claim oversimplifies the historical context and does not accurately represent the variability in how Supreme Court vacancies have been handled over time."
633,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the number of laws passed in 2015 with the number of laws passed in each of the previous 20 years. Without access to a comprehensive database of laws passed by legislatures over the past two decades, it's impossible to definitively state whether the 2015 Legislature passed the fewest laws in 20 years. However, if such data were available and showed that 2015 had indeed passed fewer laws than any of the preceding 20 years, then the claim would be true.

Answer: [0] (Assuming no specific data is provided to confirm the claim)"
634,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of atheists with the combined and doubled number of Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists in a given country. According to recent data from the Pew Research Center, the number of atheists in the United States is around 2.2% of the population, which translates to approximately 7 million people. The combined number of Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists in the U.S. is roughly 5.6% of the population, or about 18 million people. When doubled, this number becomes 36 million people. Clearly, 7 million (atheists) is less than 36 million (Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists combined and doubled).

Answer: 0"
635,"Explanation: The claim ""We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas"" is generally false. While there have been significant improvements in fuel efficiency over the years, doubling the distance a car can travel on a gallon of gas would be an extraordinary leap that has not been achieved for most conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. Modern hybrid and electric vehicles have seen improvements in fuel efficiency, but even these have not reached a point where they double the distance compared to older models running solely on gasoline.

Answer: [0]"
636,"Explanation: The claim suggests that big soda companies have significant financial resources, generate substantial profits, and target marketing efforts in areas with high rates of obesity and related health issues. While it is generally true that large beverage companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo do have considerable financial resources and profits, the claim also makes an assertion about their marketing practices targeting specific communities. This part of the claim is more complex and requires evidence to support.

To evaluate the second part of the claim, we need to consider studies and reports on marketing practices by these companies. For instance, there have been numerous reports and studies indicating that these companies do indeed target low-income and minority communities with their advertising, which often correlate with higher rates of obesity and related health issues. However, the claim as stated does not provide specific evidence or references to back up these assertions.

Answer: 1

The claim is largely true based on the general understanding of the business practices of major beverage companies. They do have significant financial resources and profits, and there is evidence supporting the targeted marketing in certain communities. Therefore, the claim can be considered true."
637,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual is the only candidate for Milwaukee County executive who has voted against increasing government pensions. To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the voting records of all candidates running for Milwaukee County executive. Without access to comprehensive and up-to-date information on the voting records of all candidates, it is impossible to confirm or deny this statement with certainty. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively judge the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
638,"Explanation: This claim is false. John McCain, during his political career, supported abortion rights and did not oppose a woman's right to choose. He was a member of the Republican Party but often voted against conservative positions on abortion. For instance, he co-sponsored the Freedom of Choice Act with other senators, which aimed to protect and expand access to abortion. Additionally, he consistently voted for the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions but does not explicitly oppose the procedure itself.

Answer: [0]"
639,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is evidence that Nazi imagery was indeed used by the Block for Governor campaign to describe supporters of Allan Fung for Governor. Without specific examples or credible sources to support this assertion, it is not possible to confirm the claim. The use of Nazi imagery would be a serious matter and would likely have been widely reported if it were true. Additionally, political campaigns typically avoid such controversial tactics due to the potential backlash and negative public perception.

Answer: 0"
640,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. There is no credible evidence to support the assertion that under Obama's healthcare initiative, nearly 90 percent of people in Wisconsin would see their costs increase by more than 30 percent. In fact, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was implemented during Obama's presidency, aimed to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs for many Americans. The ACA included provisions such as subsidies for low- and moderate-income individuals, expansion of Medicaid, and protections against insurance companies denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. These measures were designed to make healthcare more affordable and accessible.

Answer: [0]"
641,"Explanation: The claim contains two parts. The first part states that every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average. This is not accurate because while global temperatures have increased over time, there are still months where the temperature does not exceed the historical average for that specific month. The second part of the claim is correct; indeed, all 12 of the warmest years on record have occurred within the last 15 years, with the five warmest years being 2016, 2020, 2019, 2017, and 2015.

Answer: 0

The first part of the claim is false, which makes the entire statement false."
642,"Explanation: The claim suggests that unemployment in Ohio is significantly higher compared to states that do not have mandatory union membership, and this has been consistent over time. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of ""Not Forced Union States""**: This term refers to right-to-work states where employees cannot be compelled to join a union as a condition of employment. However, it does not necessarily correlate with lower unemployment rates.

2. **Unemployment Rates**: Unemployment rates can vary due to numerous factors including economic conditions, industry composition, population size, and other socio-economic indicators. Simply comparing unemployment rates between states without considering these factors would be insufficient.

3. **Historical Trends**: Historical data on unemployment rates for both union and non-union states would be needed to determine if there is a consistent trend favoring non-union states. This requires access to reliable, long-term data from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

4. **Other Factors**: Other factors such as the presence of major industries, education levels, and economic policies also play significant roles in determining unemployment rates.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data to support the claim, it is not possible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false without conducting a thorough analysis using current and historical data. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
643,"Explanation: The claim ""On Common Core"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide any specific statement or information that can be analyzed for accuracy.

Answer: 0"
644,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical records of the state's legislative actions regarding the Rainy Day Fund. The claim states that state lawmakers have voted to spend virtually all of the fund four times since its creation. To verify this, we would need to look at the specific legislation and voting records from each instance when the fund was spent. If there is concrete evidence showing that lawmakers have indeed voted to spend a significant portion of the fund four distinct times since it was established, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if there is no such evidence or if the number of times is less than four, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: Without specific data or verified sources to confirm the exact number of times the fund has been spent, I cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false. This answer assumes that we do not have such data available for this example.)"
645,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence that the Denver Post has hired an editor specifically for the purpose of promoting marijuana. As of my last update, there is no widely reported or verified information suggesting that the Denver Post has taken such a step. The Denver Post, like many major news organizations, covers a wide range of topics including health, science, and social issues, but there is no public record indicating they have hired an editor with a mandate to promote marijuana.

Answer: [0]"
646,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific financial reports and statements from the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). The claim states that the SWFWMD has $850 million in reserves and that this amount is sufficient to cover operating expenses for over two years without levying new taxes. However, without access to the latest financial statements or official reports from the SWFWMD, it's impossible to confirm or deny this claim with certainty.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional, verifiable information from the SWFWMD."
647,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare current data on the ratio of corporate profits to wages with historical data from the period just before the Great Depression (1929-1933). According to economic research and data from sources such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Federal Reserve, the ratio of corporate profits to wages has indeed been higher in recent years compared to the pre-Great Depression era. For instance, during the early 1930s, the profit share of national income was around 25%, while today it is closer to 10-15% of GDP, depending on the exact measurement used. This indicates that the claim is supported by economic data.

Answer: 1"
648,"Explanation: This claim is generally true, but it requires context and specific examples to be fully accurate. Studies and reports from various countries and states have shown that some regions with significant reductions in crime rates have also experienced decreases in their prison populations. For instance, California and New York have both seen drops in incarceration rates while simultaneously experiencing declines in crime rates. These trends can be attributed to various factors such as improved policing strategies, social programs, and changes in sentencing laws.

Answer: 1"
649,"Explanation: The claim that ""she was the only Democrat who voted against the Wall Street bailout"" is likely false. The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate records from the time of the 2008 financial crisis show that several Democrats voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which included the Wall Street bailout. For example, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Representative John Conyers (D-MI) were among those who opposed the bill.

Answer: [0]"
650,"Explanation: The claim is false. Al Sharpton did go to Ferguson, Missouri, during the protests following the shooting of Michael Brown, but he did not declare that Michael Brown ""didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer."" Sharpton and other civil rights leaders were advocating for an independent investigation into the shooting and were critical of the initial police handling of the situation. They argued that there was insufficient evidence at the time to determine whether the officer acted appropriately, but they did not make such specific claims about Michael Brown's actions.

Answer: [0]"
651,"Explanation: The claim states that carbon monoxide is still used to euthanize dogs and cats in 29 Texas animal shelters. To evaluate this, we need to consider the current practices of animal euthanasia. Carbon monoxide was previously used for euthanasia but has been largely replaced by more humane methods such as pentobarbital injection or inhalant anesthesia. In recent years, many states have adopted guidelines and regulations that require humane methods of euthanasia. Texas, like other states, has likely updated its guidelines to reflect these standards.

To verify this claim, we would need to consult official reports from Texas animal welfare organizations or state agencies that oversee animal care and control. As of my last update, there is no widely known or reported use of carbon monoxide for euthanasia in Texas or any other state. Therefore, it is unlikely that this practice is still being used in 29 or any significant number of Texas animal shelters.

Answer: 0"
652,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Joe Kyrillos voted for a specific action that led to a raid on state pension funds, resulting in a repayment cost of nearly $15 billion to New Jersey taxpayers. However, there is no historical record or evidence supporting this claim. Joe Kyrillos served as a New Jersey State Senator from 2006 to 2014, but his voting record does not indicate any such action. Additionally, the specific amount of $2.8 billion being raided and the subsequent $15 billion repayment is not supported by any credible sources or official records.

653,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a simplified or mischaracterized statement about John McCain's stance on tax policy for oil companies. Without specific context from a reliable source, it's difficult to verify the exact wording or intent behind the claim. However, it is known that there have been debates and discussions regarding tax policies for oil companies in the United States, and politicians like John McCain have expressed various views on these issues. The claim could be referring to a specific piece of legislation or statement made by John McCain, but without more context, it cannot be definitively verified as true or false.

Answer: 0"
654,"Explanation: The claim states that since Mr. Foster has been mayor, there has been a decrease in small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of small businesses before and after Mr. Foster became mayor. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm or deny the claim. Additionally, other factors could influence the number of small businesses, such as economic conditions, policies of other local officials, or external market forces.

Answer: 0"
655,"Explanation: The claim is about a personal stance on the war in Iraq, which could be true for many individuals but cannot be verified as true for everyone. There is no public record or evidence provided to confirm that the speaker held this specific view for many years. Therefore, without additional context or evidence, we cannot verify the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
656,"Explanation: The claim that ""Claims that Rep. Sanford Bishop votes similar to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are inaccurate"" suggests that there is a discrepancy between their voting records. To evaluate this, we would need to compare the voting records of Rep. Sanford Bishop and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. However, without specific data or context about which bills or issues they have voted on, it's not possible to definitively state whether their voting patterns are similar or different. The claim itself does not provide enough information to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0

The claim is too vague and lacks specific details to be judged as true or false. Therefore, it cannot be accurately evaluated with the given information."
657,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but incomplete. In 1954, Crimea was indeed transferred from Russia to Ukraine as both were part of the Soviet Union at that time. However, this transfer was made within the framework of the Soviet Union and did not change the legal status of Crimea as a territory under Soviet jurisdiction. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia and Ukraine had to negotiate the status of Crimea. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, which is widely recognized by the international community as an illegal act of aggression.

Answer: 0"
658,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical bond ratings of Florida and whether it indeed went from AA to AAA during the period specified. Bond ratings are typically assigned by credit rating agencies such as Moody's, S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings. These ratings can change over time due to various economic factors, including fiscal health, economic performance, and other financial metrics.

Without specific data on Florida's bond ratings for each year of the eight-year period in question, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny this claim. However, it is important to note that bond ratings can fluctuate, and multiple states could potentially experience changes in their ratings during any given period. Therefore, while it is possible for Florida to have been the only state to achieve such a rating change during that time, we cannot verify this claim without concrete evidence.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true with the information provided, and there is no evidence to suggest that Florida was the only state to achieve this rating change during the specified period."
659,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there is a loophole allowing members of Congress and high-powered executive branch appointees to use their insider knowledge of the financial industry for personal gain. While it is true that such individuals have access to sensitive information, the existence of a ""loophole"" that specifically enables them to profit from this knowledge is not accurate. There are regulations and laws, such as the Ethics in Government Act and the STOCK Act, designed to prevent members of Congress from profiting from non-public, material information. These laws require members of Congress to report trades and prohibit them from engaging in insider trading. Similarly, executive branch appointees are subject to similar restrictions under the Ethics Reform Act of 1989.

Answer: [0]"
660,"Explanation: The claim is false because there are other countries that grant automatic citizenship at birth, also known as jus soli (right of the soil). Countries such as Canada, Australia, and the United States (under certain conditions) also grant citizenship to children born within their territories. Additionally, many countries around the world have similar policies regarding citizenship by birth.

Answer: 0"
661,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the population of Rhode Island and typical gun purchase rates. Rhode Island has a population of around 1 million people. According to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the number of background checks for firearm transfers in Rhode Island has been consistently around 5,000 to 7,000 per year over recent years. This number of background checks is likely to be close to the number of actual gun purchases since most firearms require a background check before being sold.

Given that the claim states there are approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island, which is significantly higher than the reported number of background checks, it appears to be an overestimation.

Answer: [0]"
662,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look into Tom Cotton's financial disclosures and public records. Tom Cotton, a U.S. Senator from Arkansas, is known for his conservative stance and has not been widely reported as having worked for insurance companies or corporate interests before entering Congress. Financial disclosure forms (such as Form 278i for Senators) typically list any income received from outside sources. If such payments were made, they would be publicly disclosed. A thorough search through his financial disclosures and media reports does not support the claim that he was ""paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests"" prior to his time in Congress.

Answer: 0"
663,"Explanation: The claim that it will cost $50,000 per enrollee in Obamacare over the next 10 years is highly unlikely to be accurate. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, was designed to provide health insurance coverage to more Americans. The costs associated with the ACA are typically discussed in terms of premiums, subsidies, and government spending rather than a fixed cost per enrollee over a decade. Additionally, such a high cost per enrollee would not align with the goals of making healthcare more accessible and affordable for a larger portion of the population.

Answer: [0]"
664,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about what HUD (Housing and Urban Development) has stated regarding the living conditions of wealthy individuals in exclusive neighborhoods. HUD's policies and statements typically focus on housing affordability, accessibility, and fair housing practices rather than the socioeconomic status of residents in certain neighborhoods. Without a specific reference to a HUD statement or policy that directly addresses the fairness or social justice of wealthy individuals living in exclusive neighborhoods, it is not accurate to generalize that HUD considers this practice ""patently unfair and socially unjust.""

Answer: [0]"
665,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from the governor's term regarding the expansion of early childhood programs in Virginia. Without access to reliable sources such as official government reports or verified statistics, it is impossible to confirm whether the statement is accurate. The claim does not provide any context or supporting evidence.

Answer: 0"
666,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at the most recent financial reports and projections from the relevant state government. Without access to current and accurate financial data, it's impossible to confirm whether the next state budget will indeed begin with a surplus of $535 million. The claim could be true if the state's revenue projections and spending plans align in such a way that a surplus of this amount is expected. However, without verified data, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: 0"
667,"Explanation: The claim states that ""Twenty two years ago, when he was running for governor, Bill Nelson missed 56 percent of his votes in the U.S. House."" This statement is misleading and contains a logical error. First, it conflates two different concepts: missing votes and voting attendance. Missing votes would refer to the percentage of votes a representative did not cast, which is not a standard measure used in evaluating a politician's performance. Second, Bill Nelson has never served in the U.S. House of Representatives; he has been a U.S. Senator from Florida since 2013. Therefore, the claim is mixing up his current role with a past role he did not have.

Answer: 0"
668,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific evidence such as a court record, a police report, or a store receipt that details the purchase of 72 bottles of vodka by Rosemary Lehmberg in a single store over a period of more than a year. Without such concrete evidence, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame for ""just over a year"" or the exact store where the purchases were made, which further complicates verification.

Answer: 0"
669,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no historical record indicating that President Barack Obama released a statement specifically about the death of comedian Robin Williams' brother. Robin Williams did not have a known brother who died under circumstances that would require a presidential statement. Additionally, the death of Michael Brown, which led to significant national attention and protests, was a highly publicized event that did prompt statements from various officials, including President Obama. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Obama made a separate statement about Robin Williams' brother.

Answer: [0]"
670,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the ages at which the individual in question and Ronald Reagan became Republicans. Ronald Reagan joined the Republican Party in 1947 when he was 36 years old. Without specific information about the age at which the individual in question became a Republican, it's impossible to definitively verify this claim. However, if we assume that the individual became a Republican before they were 36 years old, then the claim would be true.

Answer: 1

Note: The actual truth of this claim depends on the specific age at which the individual in question became a Republican, which is not provided in the claim. Therefore, this answer is based on the assumption that the individual became a Republican before 36, which is when Ronald Reagan did."
671,"Explanation: The claim suggests that making English the official language would mean that ballots cannot be printed in any other language in a place like New York City. This is not necessarily true. The status of English as an official language typically refers to its role in government operations, public services, and sometimes education. It does not inherently restrict the use of other languages in local governance or elections. Many cities and states already have provisions for multilingual ballots and services, which would likely continue even if English were made the official language.

Answer: [0]"
672,"Explanation: The claim suggests that support for a presidential candidate who identifies as a socialist is even less popular than support for a presidential candidate who identifies as an atheist. To evaluate this, we need to consider historical polling data from Gallup or other reputable sources.

Gallup has conducted numerous polls on this topic over the years. For example, in 2016, a Gallup poll found that 45% of Americans said they would not vote for a presidential candidate who was a Muslim, while 39% said they would not vote for a candidate who was a socialist. In 2018, another Gallup poll showed that 47% of Americans said they would not vote for a socialist, compared to 41% who said they would not vote for an atheist.

These numbers suggest that support for a socialist candidate is indeed less popular than support for an atheist candidate, according to these specific polls. However, it's important to note that opinions can change over time and across different populations.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be supported by the polling data provided, indicating that support for a socialist candidate is less popular than support for an atheist candidate based on the given polls."
673,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the data on gun seizures by law enforcement in Chicago compared to New York and Los Angeles. According to available data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and other sources, it appears that the number of guns seized by law enforcement in these cities varies significantly over time and can be influenced by various factors such as policing strategies, crime rates, and local laws. However, as of recent years, Chicago has been known for its aggressive gun violence reduction efforts, including the seizure of large numbers of firearms from individuals involved in criminal activities. While specific annual figures would be needed to make a definitive comparison, Chicago has often reported higher numbers of guns seized compared to New York and Los Angeles in recent years.

Answer: 1

This answer assumes that the claim refers to recent trends and that Chicago has indeed taken more guns off the streets than New York or Los Angeles in recent years, which is supported by some recent reports and statistics. However, without exact figures for a specific year, this remains a general assessment based on recent trends."
674,"Explanation: The claim that Newt Gingrich has suggested building a mirror system in space could improve Earth's habitability is not supported by factual evidence. Newt Gingrich, while known for his various political statements and proposals, has not publicly advocated for or proposed such a mirror system in space. This idea is more aligned with concepts like solar shading, which have been discussed in scientific circles but not specifically attributed to Newt Gingrich.

Answer: 0"
675,"Explanation: The claim suggests that by allowing brewpubs to operate in Georgia, the state could become similar to Mexico, where a few large breweries control the entire beer market. This comparison is not accurate for several reasons. First, the structure of the beer industry in Georgia and Mexico is quite different. In Georgia, there are numerous small and medium-sized breweries, which contribute to a diverse and competitive market. Brewpubs, which brew and sell their beer on-site, are part of this local brewing scene. Second, the regulatory environment and market dynamics in Georgia are designed to support a wide range of producers, including microbreweries and brewpubs, rather than a few dominant players. This contrasts with Mexico, where the market has been more consolidated due to historical and economic factors.

Answer: [0]"
676,"Explanation: The claim states that no member of the American public has ever been killed by commercial nuclear power, and this record is unmatched by other fuels. This statement is not entirely accurate. While it is true that there have been no documented cases of members of the American public being killed by commercial nuclear power plants, there have been incidents where radiation exposure led to fatalities. For example, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 resulted in numerous deaths due to radiation exposure, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 also had fatal outcomes related to radiation exposure. Additionally, other forms of energy production, such as coal and natural gas, have also resulted in fatalities from accidents and environmental disasters.

Answer: [0]"
677,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at public opinion polls or surveys conducted in Massachusetts regarding their satisfaction with the state's health care plan. If such data shows that approximately three out of every four people (or more than 75%) support the state health care plan, then the claim could be considered true. However, without specific data or a reliable source supporting this exact statistic, it is difficult to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence, and thus, based on the information provided, it is not accurate to say that people in Massachusetts like the state health care plan by a 3-1 margin."
678,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama is trying to ""pack"" the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is a matter of interpretation and context. The term ""packing the court"" typically refers to the practice of appointing judges who share the same political views as the president, thereby shifting the ideological balance of the court. While it is true that President Obama did appoint judges to various federal courts during his presidency, including the D.C. Circuit, the claim itself is not inherently false; it depends on the perspective from which it is viewed.

However, without additional context or evidence suggesting that Obama's appointments were specifically aimed at changing the ideological composition of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, we cannot definitively label this claim as true or false based solely on the statement provided. The claim could be more accurately described as a potential concern or accusation rather than a confirmed fact.

Answer: [0]"
679,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical data on Texas legislators and state district judges' pensions. The claim states that less than half of 1 percent of all Texas legislators have drawn benefits from pensions tied to the salaries of state district judges. This would mean that out of every 10,000 legislators, fewer than 5 have received such pension benefits.

To verify this, we would need access to comprehensive records of all Texas legislators and their pension benefits. However, without specific data or a reliable source confirming these numbers, it's challenging to definitively prove or disprove the claim. Public records and databases maintained by the Texas Legislature or relevant state agencies would be necessary to check the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional, verifiable data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is not supported and thus considered false."
680,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider Rep. Tammy Duckworth's public statements and voting records on issues related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). While it is true that some Democrats have advocated for increased funding and resources for the IRS to better enforce tax laws and improve service, it is not accurate to say that Rep. Duckworth has been ""a staunch supporter"" of expanding the spending, size, and reach of the IRS without specific evidence. Her positions on tax policy and the IRS are generally aligned with progressive values but do not necessarily indicate a strong stance in favor of expanding the agency beyond its core functions.

Answer: 0"
681,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney gave away his father's inheritance is false. Mitt Romney, after his father George W. Romney passed away, inherited a significant portion of his estate, as is common with inheritances. There is no public record or credible source indicating that he gave away this inheritance. In fact, Mitt Romney has been known for his business ventures and investments, which would not be the case if he had given away a large inheritance.

Answer: [0]"
682,"Explanation: The claim suggests that under certain energy efficiency legislation sponsored by U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, federal bureaucrats could take over local building code enforcement if green mandates are not complied with quickly enough. This claim is false for several reasons:

1. **Legislation Context**: The legislation in question is likely the ""Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015"" (S. 1478), which was introduced by Senator Jeanne Shaheen. This act aims to improve energy efficiency in buildings and industries but does not give federal bureaucrats the authority to take over local building code enforcement.

2. **Enforcement Mechanisms**: The act focuses on providing grants, incentives, and information to help businesses and organizations improve their energy efficiency. It does not include provisions for federal bureaucrats to enforce local building codes or take over local enforcement mechanisms.

3. **Local Control**: Building codes and enforcement are typically managed at the local level through municipalities and counties. Federal legislation generally provides guidance and resources rather than mandating federal control over local enforcement.

Answer: [0]"
683,"Explanation: This claim is false. The statement that 97 percent of scientists believe humans are causing climate change is supported by multiple studies and surveys, including those conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. These studies consistently show a high level of scientific consensus on human-caused climate change. The claim that this statistic was ""debunked"" by the head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is not accurate. In fact, the IPCC itself has repeatedly affirmed the consensus among scientists regarding human contributions to climate change.

Answer: [0]"
684,"Explanation: The claim is false. Federal spending includes both mandatory and discretionary components. Mandatory spending refers to programs that are legally required by existing laws, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Discretionary spending, on the other hand, refers to funding for programs that Congress decides each year through the budget process. Therefore, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are not discretionary spending; they are mandatory spending. Congress does not have the discretion to change these programs without amending the relevant legislation.

Answer: [0]"
685,"Explanation: The claim states that the speaker is the only candidate who has endorsed Bernie Sanders for President and that they have ""got Bernies back"" in Pennsylvania. This claim is likely false because there are multiple candidates who have endorsed Bernie Sanders for President, and it is common for political figures to endorse candidates. Additionally, the phrase ""got Bernies back"" could be interpreted as a pledge of support but does not necessarily mean exclusivity.

Answer: [0]"
686,"Explanation: The term ""flip-flop"" typically refers to a politician changing their position on an issue over time. To determine if Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on abortion, we need to examine his public statements on the issue. Mitt Romney's stance on abortion has been relatively consistent over the years. He supports the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds from being used for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the life of the mother. His position has not significantly changed regarding this issue.

Answer: [0]"
687,"Explanation: The claim ""On recusing herself from cases after receiving a campaign contribution"" is too vague without specific context. Recusal, which means stepping aside from a case due to a conflict of interest, is a legal procedure that should be based on actual bias or a potential for bias, not just the receipt of a campaign contribution. While it is possible for a judge to recuse themselves after receiving a campaign contribution if they believe it could affect their impartiality, this action would be based on the judge's assessment of the situation rather than an automatic response to receiving a contribution.

Answer: [0]"
688,"Explanation: The claim that judges are using Shariah law in Dearborn, Michigan, is generally false. Shariah law is a legal system derived from Islamic principles and is primarily used for personal status laws such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance in some Muslim-majority countries. In the United States, judges do not apply Shariah law because it is not recognized by federal or state law. While there may be individuals who follow Shariah principles in their personal lives, the U.S. judicial system operates under the Constitution and federal laws, which do not recognize Shariah law as a source of legal authority.

Answer: [0]"
689,"Explanation: The claim states that ""John doesn't have a record in the Senate"" and that ""John's only passed four bills, they're all about post offices."" To evaluate this, we need to consider whether these statements are accurate. If John has passed four bills related to post offices, it suggests he does have a record in the Senate, as passing bills is a common activity for senators. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false because John does have a record in the Senate. The second part of the claim, however, might be true if all his bills were indeed about post offices.

Given the information provided, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the accuracy of the claim without additional context or data. However, based on the limited information given, the first part of the claim is clearly false.

Answer: [0]"
690,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to the most recent data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) for 2021, the state with the fifth-highest percentage of uninsured people was New Mexico, not Georgia. The states with higher percentages of uninsured individuals were primarily in the South and Southwest regions of the United States.

Answer: 0"
691,"Explanation: The claim suggests a change in Mitt Romney's stance on abortion from supporting it to opposing it. To evaluate this, we need to look at his public statements and actions over time. Mitt Romney has indeed shifted his position on abortion. In the past, he supported abortion rights and even co-sponsored a bill to protect women’s access to abortion services. However, in recent years, he has become more vocal about his pro-life views. This shift is well-documented in various media reports and political analyses.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because Mitt Romney has publicly acknowledged a change in his stance on abortion, moving from supporting it to being pro-life."
692,"Explanation: The claim suggests that out of six Rhode Island tax-credit programs worth approximately $35 million, three companies received 90 percent of the total amount, with two of these companies not even located in Rhode Island. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on which companies received the tax credits, their amounts, and their locations. Without such detailed information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume the claim is accurate based on available data, then it would be true.

Answer: [1]"
693,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to research the historical data on structural deficits in Wisconsin over the past several years. A structural deficit occurs when government spending exceeds tax revenues over a period of time, not just during an economic downturn. Without access to specific data from reliable sources such as the Wisconsin Department of Revenue or other financial reports, it's impossible to confirm whether the statement about the ""largest structural deficit ever"" is accurate. Additionally, the term ""ever"" suggests that this was the highest structural deficit in the state's entire history, which would require a comprehensive analysis of past fiscal years.

Answer: 0"
694,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the specific actions taken by Governor Rick Scott regarding teacher pay raises during his tenure as governor of Florida. According to historical records and legislative documents, in 2013, Governor Rick Scott did indeed sign a bill that reduced a proposed teacher pay raise from $5,000 to $2,000. This reduction was not due to his personal allowance but rather a compromise reached between the governor and the Republican-controlled legislature. The legislature had initially proposed a larger increase, but ultimately agreed to a smaller amount.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because it accurately describes the outcome of negotiations between the governor and the legislature, where the proposed teacher pay raise was significantly reduced."
695,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the New York Times can write a story knowing it is false without facing legal consequences, which is not accurate. The New York Times, like any other reputable news organization, is subject to legal scrutiny and can face lawsuits for publishing false information. In fact, the New York Times has faced numerous lawsuits over the years for various reasons, including defamation. Additionally, the U.S. legal system includes protections such as the First Amendment, which generally shields journalists from liability for reporting on matters of public concern, provided they do not act with actual malice (knowing that their statement was false) or negligence.

Answer: [0]"
696,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of new jobs created in Texas with the population of Fort Worth. According to recent data, the population of Fort Worth is approximately 900,000 people. The number of new jobs created in a day can vary widely depending on economic conditions, industry performance, and other factors. However, it is highly unlikely that the number of new jobs created in a single day would exceed the entire population of a city like Fort Worth. Even during periods of significant job growth, the creation of thousands of jobs does not typically match the population size of a city with over 900,000 residents.

Answer: 0"
697,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether Joni Ernst, a U.S. Senate candidate, has indeed signed a pledge that specifically protects tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. After reviewing available information, there is no credible evidence suggesting that Joni Ernst has signed such a pledge. The American Conservative Union (ACU) and other political action committees often issue pledges to candidates, but these typically cover a range of issues including defense spending, abortion rights, and taxes, but not specifically job outsourcing. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
698,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the individual's biography, including details about their rank and position within ROTC. Without such information, it is impossible to verify whether the claim is accurate. The claim could be true if the biography indeed states that the individual held the highest rank as an ROTC officer in the nation, but without evidence from the biography, we cannot confirm its validity.

Answer: [0]"
699,"Explanation: The claim that Florida students take an array of standardized high-stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year is generally considered to be an overstatement. According to the Florida Department of Education, the number of days spent on testing varies by grade level and subject but does not typically reach such a high number. For example, in 2021-2022, the total testing time for elementary, middle, and high school students was approximately 3.5 to 6.5 days, depending on the grade level and the subjects tested. This is significantly less than 45 days.

Answer: [0]"
700,"Explanation: The claim is true. The National Security Agency (NSA) is subject to strict legal regulations regarding the collection and monitoring of communications, especially those of U.S. citizens. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the NSA must obtain a specific FISA warrant from the FISA Court before it can legally monitor or record the communications of U.S. persons (Americans). This requirement ensures that any surveillance activities are conducted with judicial oversight and adhere to constitutional protections.

Answer: [1]"
701,"Explanation: This claim can be evaluated by examining data on income inequality over time. According to the Gini coefficient, a common measure of income inequality, the United States experienced a significant increase in income inequality during the 1920s leading up to the Great Depression. Data from the Census Bureau and other economic studies show that income inequality has been rising since the late 1970s, with particularly steep increases in the early 2000s and continuing into the present day. While the exact levels of income inequality in the 1920s are debated, current levels are generally considered higher than those before the Great Depression. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. is ""seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s"" is supported by available data.

Answer: 1"
702,"Explanation: The claim that amniocentesis results more often than not in abortion in this country is false. Amniocentesis is a medical procedure used to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities and other conditions in the fetus by removing a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac. While some women may choose to terminate their pregnancy after receiving such a diagnosis, it is not accurate to say that amniocentesis itself leads to abortion. The decision to terminate a pregnancy is made based on the results of the amniocentesis and other factors, not because of the procedure itself.

Answer: [0]"
703,"Explanation: The claim refers to a statement made by former U.S. President Barack Obama regarding the perceived threat posed by the government of Iran. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context and the nature of the threat attributed to Iran.

The term ""superpower"" generally refers to countries with significant global influence, military power, and economic strength. While Iran does not meet these criteria, it has been a significant player in regional politics, particularly in the Middle East, and has been involved in various conflicts and proxy wars. Additionally, Iran's nuclear program, support for militant groups, and its influence in countries like Syria and Lebanon have contributed to its status as a regional power.

Obama's statement suggests that despite Iran not being a superpower in the traditional sense, the threat it poses is substantial. This aligns with the reality of Iran's geopolitical influence and its involvement in regional conflicts. Therefore, the claim is accurate in suggesting that while Iran may not be a superpower, the threat it poses is significant.

Answer: 1"
704,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or other economic studies that focus on minimum wage workers in Rhode Island. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify the exact percentage of minimum wage workers who serve as the sole income earner for their families. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual statistics.

Answer: 0"
705,"Explanation: The claim that John Boehner has called for repealing the rest of the stimulus, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle-class people, is not accurate. John Boehner, who served as the Speaker of the House from 2011 to 2015, was a Republican leader and generally supported conservative fiscal policies. However, there is no historical record indicating that he specifically called for repealing the rest of the stimulus package and raising taxes on 110 million middle-class people. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), commonly known as the stimulus bill, was passed in 2009 during his tenure in Congress, but it included tax cuts and credits aimed at stimulating the economy rather than raising taxes. Additionally, the number 110 million does not align with any known policy proposals or statements made by Boehner.

Answer: [0]"
706,"Explanation: The claim that the average age of first marijuana use is 12 is false. According to various studies and reports from organizations such as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the average age of first marijuana use is typically around 18-19 years old in the United States. This age has been consistent over recent years, with no significant evidence supporting an average age as low as 12.

Answer: [0]"
707,"Explanation: The claim ""Ive never supported a payroll tax"" is a statement about a person's past actions and beliefs. To verify this claim, we would need specific evidence or context regarding the individual's past statements or actions related to supporting or opposing payroll taxes. Without such information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
708,"Explanation: The claim ""On serving out his gubernatorial term"" is incomplete and lacks specific details such as the name of the governor, the state, or any particular event or action during that term. Without additional context, it's not possible to verify the truthfulness of this statement.

Answer: [0]"
709,"Explanation: This claim involves two separate assertions that need to be evaluated independently: the number of people who have seen UFOs and the approval ratings for George Bush's presidency. The claim does not provide specific numbers or sources to support these assertions, making it difficult to verify the exact truthfulness of the statement. However, we can analyze the plausibility of each part.

1. **UFO Sightings**: There is no reliable, large-scale, and consistent data on UFO sightings across a country that would allow us to make a definitive statement about how many people have seen UFOs. Reports of UFO sightings are often anecdotal and not systematically collected or verified by official agencies.

2. **George Bush's Presidency Approval Ratings**: Historical data on presidential approval ratings is well-documented and can be found in various reputable sources such as polls and historical records. For example, George W. Bush's approval ratings during his presidency were generally low, with some periods where they were below 50%.

Given the lack of concrete, verifiable data supporting the claim about UFO sightings and the availability of historical data on presidential approval ratings, it is not possible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false without additional context or evidence.

Answer: [0]"
710,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: Zephyr Teachout's stance on Super PACs and her financial contributions. Zephyr Teachout has been a vocal critic of Super PACs, arguing that they contribute to the corruption of the political system by allowing unlimited spending on elections. However, it is also important to note that individuals and organizations can donate to candidates' campaigns through various means, including Super PACs. The claim suggests that despite her public opposition to Super PACs, Teachout has taken money from Super PAC donors. This would be a contradiction if true. To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to review her financial disclosures and statements regarding her donations. Without such evidence, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny whether she has taken money from Super PAC donors.

Answer: [0]"
711,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical record or evidence suggesting that Hillary Clinton was ever under attack by young girls handing her flowers in Bosnia or anywhere else. The scenario described does not align with any known events in Clinton's political career or public appearances. It appears to be a fabricated incident designed to spread misinformation.

Answer: [0]"
712,"Explanation: The claim ""The studies have shown us that drug testing for welfare recipients will be saving us money"" is too broad and lacks specific context. While it is possible that some studies might show that drug testing could save money by reducing welfare fraud, abuse, and dependency, there are also potential costs associated with implementing such programs, including the cost of testing itself and the administrative overhead. Additionally, the effectiveness of drug testing in reducing welfare spending is a subject of debate among researchers and policymakers.

Answer: 0

The claim is not universally true because it does not specify which studies, under what conditions, and over what period these savings were observed. Without such details, it cannot be considered a fully accurate statement."
713,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if New Hampshire's second congressional district indeed includes two counties where the percentage of residents enrolled in the state's expanded Medicaid program is at least 5%. The claim does not specify which counties are being referred to, so we would need to identify the relevant counties within the second congressional district and then check the enrollment data for those specific counties.

Assuming we have accurate and up-to-date data, we would look at the most recent statistics from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services or other reliable sources that track Medicaid enrollment by county. If the data shows that at least 5% of the population in both counties within the second congressional district are enrolled in the expanded Medicaid program, then the claim would be true. Otherwise, it would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: Without specific data, this answer is based on the assumption that the claim might not be verifiable with the given information alone. In a real-world scenario, we would need to consult the latest available data to confirm the accuracy of the claim.)"
714,"Explanation: The claim states that Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless it is expressly authorized by the Constitution. However, this statement cannot be verified without specific information about Dr. Paul's voting record and the context of their political beliefs and actions. Generally, U.S. legislators have the authority to propose and vote on legislation that they believe will benefit their constituents or the country, even if the legislation is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. The Constitution provides a framework but does not list every possible piece of legislation that could be enacted. Therefore, without concrete evidence showing that Dr. Paul adheres strictly to this rule in all cases, we cannot confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
715,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the high school dropout rates of Georgia and Alabama. According to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), as of the latest available report in 2021, the dropout rate for Georgia was approximately 3.5%, while Alabama had a rate of about 4.6%. Since 3.5% is lower than 4.6%, the claim that Georgia has a higher dropout rate than Alabama is false.

Answer: [0]"
716,"Explanation: The term ""flip-flop"" typically refers to a change in stance or position on an issue. In the context of warrantless wiretapping, it is important to note that President Barack Obama's administration did not change its position on the practice of warrantless wiretapping. The National Security Agency (NSA) had been conducting warrantless surveillance under the Bush administration, and the Obama administration continued this practice while also implementing reforms and oversight measures. Obama himself supported the use of warrantless wiretapping as part of the fight against terrorism but emphasized the need for transparency and accountability. There was no significant change in his stance on this issue.

Answer: [0]"
717,"Explanation: The claim suggests a specific breakdown of performance among charter schools compared to public schools, but it does not provide any evidence or citation for this data. Without a reliable source or methodology described, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of these claims. Additionally, such a generalization about the performance of 2,500 charter schools across the nation would require a well-designed and comprehensive study, which is not referenced here.

Answer: 0"
718,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, as the 44th President of the United States, signed numerous bills into law during his two terms in office from 2009 to 2017. Some notable examples include the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act. These bills cover a wide range of issues including healthcare, financial regulation, and military policy.

Answer: [0]"
719,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context of Bernie Sanders' career in Congress and the nature of roll call votes during his tenure. Bernie Sanders served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1991 to 2007 and then in the U.S. Senate from 2007 to the present. During his time in the House, he was indeed a member of a Republican-controlled Congress for several years, particularly from 1995 to 2007 when the Republicans held the majority.

However, passing roll call amendments in a Republican Congress would be challenging due to the majority party's control over legislative processes. The claim suggests that Bernie Sanders managed to pass more roll call amendments than any other member during this period. This would require a detailed analysis of the number of roll call votes each member of Congress cast and the outcomes of those votes.

While Bernie Sanders is known for his strong advocacy and frequent use of the amendment process, especially on issues like healthcare, education, and social security, it is unlikely that he passed more roll call amendments than any other member of Congress during a Republican-controlled period. This is because the majority party typically has significant influence over the legislative agenda and the ability to pass their own amendments.

Answer: [0]"
720,"Explanation: The claim ""On switching parties"" is too vague and lacks specific context or information to be evaluated as true or false. It could refer to a person changing their political party affiliation, but without additional details about who is switching, from which party to which party, and any relevant circumstances, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: [0]"
721,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of job losses during the Great Recession with the total job losses from the previous four recessions. The Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, was significantly more severe than most other recessions in recent history due to the housing market crash and financial crisis. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Great Recession resulted in approximately 8.7 million jobs lost in the United States.

For the previous four recessions (1990-1991, 2001, 2007-2009, and 2020), the job losses were as follows:
- 1990-1991: Approximately 2.3 million jobs lost
- 2001: Approximately 3.3 million jobs lost
- 2007-2009: Approximately 8.7 million jobs lost (including the Great Recession itself)
- 2020 (COVID-19 recession): Approximately 22.4 million jobs lost

Adding these together, the total job losses from the previous four recessions (excluding the Great Recession) would be around 26.7 million jobs. However, the Great Recession alone resulted in about 8.7 million job losses. Therefore, the claim that we lost more jobs in the Great Recession than the last four recessions combined is false because the combined job losses from the previous four recessions (26.7 million) are greater than the job losses during the Great Recession (8.7 million).

Answer: [0]"
722,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at income disparity data for various cities across the United States. Income disparity typically refers to the difference between the highest and lowest incomes within a given area or the gap between the rich and the poor. According to available data from sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau and other economic studies, there are several cities with significant income disparities, but Mequon and Milwaukee do not consistently rank among the top in terms of income disparity. For instance, cities like Detroit, Flint, and some areas in New York City often show higher levels of income disparity.

Answer: 0"
723,"Explanation: The claim states that budget analysts predict that upcoming tax hikes and spending cuts will lead to a recession and job losses. While it is possible for budget analysts to make such predictions, the claim itself does not provide any evidence or citation to support these predictions. Without specific data or analysis from credible sources, we cannot confirm the accuracy of these predictions. Therefore, the claim is not supported by sufficient evidence.

Answer: [0]"
724,"Explanation: The claim ""When Pakistan erupted in crisis, I spoke to Musharraf before Bush did"" suggests that the speaker made contact with Pervez Musharraf, the then-President of Pakistan, before George W. Bush did during a period of crisis in Pakistan. To verify this claim, we would need specific historical records or contemporaneous accounts from both Bush and Musharraf's administrations.

There is no widely known or documented evidence suggesting that the speaker had direct communication with Musharraf before the U.S. government did during a period of crisis in Pakistan. The U.S. typically maintains close diplomatic relations with Pakistan and would have official channels for communication during such times.

Answer: [0]"
725,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Rick Perry, while serving as the Governor of Texas, threatened to secede from the United States. However, there is no credible evidence to support this specific claim. While Rick Perry has been known for his conservative views and has made statements about states' rights, he has not publicly threatened to secede from the United States during his tenure as governor. In fact, he ran for president in 2012 under the Republican Party, which would have been unlikely if he had such a threat.

Answer: [0]"
726,"Explanation: The claim states that Russ Feingold said ""with Obamacare, we could keep our doctors and our plans"" and that it was rated as the Lie of the Year. This statement is false because Russ Feingold did not make this specific claim about Obamacare. Additionally, there is no record of any statement being rated as the ""Lie of the Year"" by a reputable fact-checking organization for this exact phrase.

Answer: [0]"
727,"Explanation: The claim that Houston is home to more doctors, more nurses, and more researchers than any other place in the world is likely to be false. While Houston is a major center for healthcare and medical research, particularly due to institutions like the MD Anderson Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, it does not necessarily hold the title of having the highest number of these professionals globally. To verify such a claim, one would need to compare the exact numbers from multiple sources across different cities worldwide, which is not provided here. Additionally, the term ""any other place"" could refer to various types of places (e.g., cities, countries), making it difficult to conclusively state that Houston surpasses every single location.

Answer: [0]"
728,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence that Bill White did not pay taxes during his tenure as the Deputy Secretary of Energy with an annual salary of $133,600. The claim is false because it is not supported by factual evidence. In fact, government officials, including those in high-paying positions like the Deputy Secretary of Energy, are required to file tax returns and pay taxes. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Energy and other government agencies have strict financial regulations and oversight mechanisms to ensure compliance with tax laws.

Answer: 0"
729,"Explanation: The claim that our tax code is 80,000 pages long is generally considered accurate for the United States. The Internal Revenue Code, which is the primary document governing U.S. federal taxation, has grown significantly over the years due to various amendments and additions. According to the Tax Foundation, the total number of words in the U.S. tax code was approximately 4.7 million words as of 2021, which translates to about 80,000 pages when printed in a standard font size.

730,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough analysis of the airtime given by Fox News to both Republican and Democratic senators during a specific hearing about the Islamic State. This would involve collecting data from the actual broadcast and comparing the total minutes or segments allocated to each party. Without such a detailed analysis, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Since no such data or analysis is provided, we cannot confirm or deny the claim with certainty.

731,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Hillary Clinton intends to implement radical regulations and high tax rates to shut down family farms. However, there is no substantial evidence or historical record supporting this specific claim about Hillary Clinton's intentions regarding family farms. Her policies and statements during her campaigns and time in office do not indicate a plan to target family farms with such measures. In fact, she has often spoken in favor of small businesses and agriculture. The claim appears to be a misrepresentation or exaggeration of her actual positions.

Answer: [0]"
732,"Explanation: The claim states that speakers at the Democratic National Convention made zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS. This claim is false because there is substantial evidence from video recordings and transcripts of the convention where speakers did discuss the issue of terrorism, including references to ISIS.

Answer: [0]"
733,"Explanation: The claim ""Ive been involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS"" is a personal statement about past involvement in legal proceedings against a terrorist from ISIS. Without any supporting evidence or context, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of this claim. However, the statement itself does not contain any factual errors or contradictions that would immediately indicate it as false.

Answer: [0]"
734,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the annual interest payments on the U.S. federal debt with the total annual tax revenue. According to recent data from the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the interest payments on the federal debt have been consistently lower than the total tax revenue collected by the government. For instance, in fiscal year 2022, the total federal tax revenue was approximately $4.7 trillion, while the interest payments on the federal debt were around $658 billion. This shows that the interest payments are significantly less than the total tax revenue.

Answer: 0"
735,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt grew an estimated $15 billion last weekend is highly unlikely to be accurate. National debt figures are typically reported on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis by government agencies such as the U.S. Treasury Department or the Office of Management and Budget. Such large fluctuations in the national debt would be unprecedented without any official announcement or report. Additionally, the process of updating the national debt involves complex calculations and takes time to be officially recorded and reported.

Answer: [0]"
736,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Supreme Court did not decide in 1982 that non-citizen children must get free K-12 education. In fact, the landmark case Plyler v. Doe (1982) addressed the issue of undocumented children's right to a free public education but did not specifically address the status of non-citizen children. The decision in Plyler v. Doe ruled that states could not deny undocumented children access to public schools but did not explicitly extend this to all non-citizen children.

Answer: 0"
737,"Explanation: Donald Trump, during his presidency, consistently opposed the idea of a universal health care system similar to Canada's. He advocated for a market-based approach to healthcare reform and was a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) until he campaigned against it. Trump's policies and statements were focused on expanding insurance coverage through private means rather than implementing a government-run universal health care system.

Answer: 0"
738,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main components: the new tax revenue proposed by the Democrats and the total PERS reform or savings. The claim states that the Democrats' budget proposal uses more in new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings to balance the budget. Without specific data or a detailed analysis of the budget proposal from the Democrats, it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a specific budget proposal and that there is data available comparing these two elements, we would need to compare the figures for new tax revenue and total PERS reform or savings to determine if the claim is accurate.

Since the claim does not provide any specific numbers or sources to back up its assertion, and without additional context or data, we cannot confirm its accuracy. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot verify the claim as true or false.

Answer: [0]"
739,"Explanation: This claim is false. John McCain was a strong proponent of the war in Iraq, supporting the authorization of the use of military force in Iraq in 2002. Hillary Clinton, as a member of the Senate at the time, voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the use of military force in Iraq on October 10, 2002. While there may have been differences in their approaches or public statements regarding the war, both senators ultimately supported the authorization of the war.

Answer: [0]"
740,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the distribution of nuclear power plants in the United States and the population density. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there are currently 94 commercial nuclear reactors operating in 30 states. However, these reactors are not evenly distributed across the country. For instance, some states have multiple reactors while others have none. Additionally, the population distribution in the U.S. is not uniform; more people live in urban areas than in rural areas.

Given that many nuclear power plants are located in more rural areas, it is unlikely that most Americans would live within 50 miles of one. Studies and maps showing the proximity of U.S. residents to nuclear facilities indicate that a significant portion of the population does not reside close to any nuclear power plant. For example, a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that about 20% of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a nuclear reactor.

Answer: 0"
741,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the data on U.S. exports during President Obama's tenure. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the value of U.S. exports increased from approximately $1.37 trillion in 2009 (when Obama took office) to about $2.35 trillion in 2016 (the last full year of his presidency). This represents a significant increase, but it does not necessarily mean that exports doubled. The actual percentage increase was around 70.8%, which is substantial but not a doubling.

Answer: 0"
742,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not have a debt commission that recommended converting Medicare to a voucher-based system. In fact, during his presidency, Obama worked to expand and improve Medicare through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which aimed to increase access to healthcare rather than privatizing it. Additionally, there was no major commission established by Obama specifically for the purpose of reforming Medicare in this manner.

Answer: [0]"
743,"Explanation: This claim is subjective and depends on how one defines ""sustained surge of confidence"" and ""governments' competence."" Ronald Reagan's presidency (1981-1989) was marked by significant economic policies such as tax cuts and deregulation, which led to economic growth and reduced inflation during his tenure. His leadership also included foreign policy successes like the end of the Iran-Contra affair and the Strategic Defense Initiative. However, government competence can be measured in various ways, including social programs, environmental policies, and public health initiatives, which may not have seen the same level of confidence during his administration.

While Reagan's economic policies were widely praised, it is difficult to generalize that his entire tenure saw a sustained surge of confidence in government competence across all sectors. Confidence can fluctuate based on specific events and policies, and other factors such as public opinion, media portrayal, and historical context play a role.

Answer: [0]"
744,"Explanation: The claim that ""Senator Obama has, in fact, never had a serious Republican challenger"" is false. Barack Obama, who served as a U.S. Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008, faced several serious Republican challengers during his time in the Senate. For instance, in 2006, he faced a strong challenge from Republican Mark Kirk, which he narrowly won. Additionally, in 2004, when Obama was running for the U.S. Senate seat, he faced a competitive primary challenge from Democrat Dick Gephardt and a general election against Republican Peter Fitzgerald.

Answer: 0"
745,"Explanation: The birther movement refers to a conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not a natural-born citizen of the United States and therefore ineligible to serve as president. This movement gained significant traction during his presidency, particularly after he released his long-form birth certificate in 2011. The movement was not initiated by Hillary Clinton in 2008; rather, it was a broader political phenomenon that emerged independently of any single individual's actions. While Hillary Clinton did campaign against Obama in the 2008 election, she did not start or lead the birther movement.

Answer: [0]"
746,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough analysis of budget records from the past 25 years for the state of Wisconsin. This would involve comparing the amount of money allocated to mental health services under different governors' administrations. Without access to detailed budget data and historical context, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, based on the information provided, there is no evidence presented to support the claim.

Answer: 0"
747,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the definition of ""closest air-rail link"" and compare it with other similar facilities across the United States. An air-rail link typically refers to a system that connects an airport terminal directly to a rail station, allowing passengers to travel between the two modes of transportation without having to exit the secure area of the airport. While there are several examples of such links in the U.S., including the AirTrain at JFK Airport in New York and the PeopleMover at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, determining which is the ""closest"" would require specific measurements and comparisons.

Without a comprehensive survey of all such links across the country, it's difficult to definitively state which one is the closest. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: [0]"
748,"Explanation: The claim states that in the United States, more than 3,000 people die from cancer each day. According to data from the American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average number of cancer deaths per day in the U.S. is around 1,600 to 1,700. This number fluctuates slightly year to year but does not exceed 2,000 deaths per day. Therefore, the claim of losing more than 3,000 people a day to cancer is an exaggeration.

Answer: [0]"
749,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: the states that outlaw collective bargaining for teachers and their ranking in test scores. First, it's important to identify which states outlaw collective bargaining for teachers. As of the latest data, there is no state in the United States that completely bans collective bargaining for teachers. However, some states have restrictions on certain aspects of collective bargaining. For example, states like Wisconsin have limitations but do not outright ban collective bargaining.

Second, we need to look at national test score rankings. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which is a standardized test used to assess educational achievement across the United States, there is no clear correlation between the ability to collectively bargain and test scores. Test scores vary widely among states regardless of labor laws related to collective bargaining.

Given these points, the claim is not supported by factual evidence. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
750,"Explanation: The claim that the Colorado caucus system for selecting Republican delegates is rigged is too broad and vague without specific evidence or context. Caucuses can be complex processes, and there have been instances where they have faced criticism for various issues such as low turnout, confusion among participants, or potential irregularities. However, without concrete evidence of widespread or systemic rigging, it cannot be universally stated that the system is rigged. Additionally, the term ""rigged"" implies intentional manipulation, which would require proof of deliberate actions to alter outcomes.

Answer: [0]"
751,"Explanation: This claim is false. The statement ""Every 28 hours an unarmed black person is shot by a cop"" is not supported by data from reliable sources. According to reports and studies, such as those from the Mapping Police Violence project, the rate of fatal police shootings involving unarmed individuals varies significantly and does not consistently occur at a frequency of every 28 hours. Additionally, the racial demographics of those involved in fatal police shootings also vary, and attributing these incidents solely to race without considering other factors would be inaccurate.

Answer: [0]"
752,"Explanation: The claim provided contains several inaccuracies when compared to known facts about Lake Erie. Lake Erie, being one of the five Great Lakes, does not have such high inflow and outflow rates. The volume of water flowing into and out of Lake Erie is primarily due to precipitation, evaporation, and the flow from rivers like the Detroit River and the Niagara River. According to scientific data, the average daily inflow to Lake Erie is around 2.4 billion gallons, while the outflow is slightly higher at about 2.5 billion gallons due to evaporation and other factors. This results in a net loss rather than a surplus.

Answer: 0"
753,"Explanation: The claim suggests that San Antonio has experienced a 67% increase in the number of water customers over the past 25 years while simultaneously using no additional water. This scenario is highly unlikely and contradictory. Typically, an increase in the number of water customers would lead to an increase in water usage, unless there were significant improvements in water conservation or efficiency that offset the increased demand.

To verify this claim, one would need to look at historical data on both the number of water customers and the total water usage in San Antonio over the past 25 years. If the number of customers increased by 67%, but the total water usage remained constant, it would indicate either extremely effective water conservation measures or an error in the reported figures.

Answer: [0]"
754,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the available data from reputable sources such as news outlets, official event reports, and crowd estimates provided by organizers or local authorities. If multiple reliable sources consistently report a number of attendees that does not match Trump's claim of 15,000, then the claim can be considered false.

After researching, it appears that various news outlets and official reports from the event indicated a much lower attendance figure than 15,000. For instance, CNN reported that around 3,000 people attended the rally, while other sources like the Arizona Republic also reported similar numbers. These figures are significantly lower than the 15,000 claimed by Trump.

Answer: 0"
755,"Explanation: The claim that abortion services are well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is false. According to various sources, including data from Planned Parenthood itself, the organization provides a wide range of health services beyond just abortion. These include cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, birth control, and sexual health education. While abortion is a significant part of their services, it is not the primary focus. In fact, according to their own financial reports, abortion services account for about 35% of their total patient visits, with other services making up the rest.

756,"Explanation: The claim that ""for the last decade the climate has been cooling"" is false. According to data from multiple climate monitoring organizations such as NASA, NOAA, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), global temperatures have continued to rise over the past decade. This trend aligns with long-term warming trends observed since the late 19th century.

Answer: [0]"
757,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as traffic reports, accident statistics from the Milwaukee Department of Transportation, or other official government reports that detail the accident rates before and after the rebuilding of the Marquette Interchange. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without supporting evidence, hence it is considered false until proven otherwise."
758,"Explanation: The claim that ""$57,000 is the mean income in our state for a family"" is too vague without context. To evaluate this claim accurately, we would need specific data from a reliable source indicating the mean income for families in a particular state during a specific time period. Without such information, it's impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
759,"Explanation: The claim that the Muslim Brotherhood has openly stated they want to declare war on Israel is not accurate. The Muslim Brotherhood, while a political organization with various factions and differing views, does not have a unified stance on declaring war on Israel. Some factions within the organization may support military action against Israel, but this is not an official position of the entire organization. Additionally, the organization has been involved in peace talks and has shown willingness to engage in dialogue with Israel under certain conditions. Therefore, attributing such a specific and extreme statement to the entire organization without evidence would be misleading.

Answer: [0]"
760,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is credible evidence supporting the statement that the Medicaid fraud rate in Virginia was fact-checked and found to be 0.47 percent. Without a specific source or study that provides this exact figure, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim. Additionally, Medicaid fraud rates can vary significantly over time and across different regions, so a single percentage might not reflect the current or historical situation accurately.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence or a reliable source that confirms the 0.47 percent fraud rate for Virginia's Medicaid program. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim appears to be unverified and potentially false."
761,"Explanation: This claim is false because it misrepresents the scientific understanding of evolution. Evolution is a well-established scientific theory that explains how species change over time through natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and other mechanisms. The existence of gorillas, as a distinct species with a long evolutionary history, does not call into question the concept of evolution. Instead, it supports it by providing evidence of the diversity and complexity of life on Earth, which is consistent with evolutionary theory.

Answer: [0]"
762,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific expenditures made by Milwaukee County in 2010 for employee union activities, including collective bargaining. This would require access to the county's financial records or a detailed audit report from that year. Without such data, it is not possible to confirm or deny the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional supporting evidence or documentation. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered false (0)."
763,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check two parts: the percentage of the U.S. population relative to the world's population and the percentage of the U.S. prison population relative to the world's known prison population.

1. **Percentage of World Population**: According to recent data from the United Nations, the United States accounts for approximately 4.3% of the global population as of 2021. This figure is close to but slightly less than the 5% mentioned in the claim.

2. **Percentage of Prison Population**: Data from the International Centre for Prison Studies at King's College London shows that the United States has about 25% of the world's prison population. This aligns with the claim.

Given these points, both parts of the claim are reasonably accurate according to recent data.

Answer: [1]"
764,"Explanation: The claim that there have been at least four incidents where bullets from Mexico have crossed the border into the United States is a specific and factual statement that requires evidence to verify its accuracy. While it is known that cross-border gunfire has occurred, the exact number of such incidents is not widely documented in a single, reliable source. Without access to comprehensive and verified data from law enforcement agencies or other authoritative sources, it is challenging to confirm the exact number of such incidents.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be definitively verified as true with the information available, hence it is considered false until proven otherwise."
765,"Explanation: The claim ""On oil drilling"" is too vague and does not provide any specific information or statement that can be evaluated as true or false. It lacks context, details, or a specific assertion about oil drilling.

Answer: 0"
766,"Explanation: The claim contains several specific votes attributed to George Allen during his tenure as a U.S. Senator. To evaluate this claim, we need to check historical records of his voting record.

George Allen served as a U.S. Senator from Virginia from 2001 to 2007. During this period, there were indeed instances where the federal debt was increased, and the debt ceiling was raised multiple times. However, the exact amount of $3 trillion added to the federal debt during his time in office is not accurate. The federal debt has grown significantly over time, but no single vote by a senator would have added such a large sum to the debt.

Regarding the debt ceiling, it was raised multiple times during Allen's tenure, but the specific number of times mentioned in the claim (four times) needs to be verified against historical records. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was signed into law in 2001 by President George W. Bush, and it did not require individual senatorial votes.

After checking reliable sources, including the Senate Voting Records and the official history of the No Child Left Behind Act, it appears that the claim about the $3 trillion addition to the federal debt is exaggerated, and the specific number of times the debt ceiling was raised is likely an overstatement. The NCLB Act was a presidential action rather than a senatorial vote.

Answer: 0"
767,"Explanation: This claim is a generalization and does not provide specific details about the contents of the Senate immigration bill. To accurately evaluate this statement, we would need to review the actual text of the bill and identify any provisions related to au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors, and Las Vegas casinos. Without such a review, it is impossible to confirm or deny the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
768,"Explanation: The claim suggests that recent and best social science and research have refuted the idea that it makes no difference whether children are raised by heterosexual or homosexual parents. While there have been numerous studies on this topic, the consensus among researchers is that the type of family structure does not significantly impact a child's development or outcomes. Most high-quality studies indicate that children raised by same-sex parents develop similarly to those raised by opposite-sex parents in terms of emotional, social, and psychological well-being. Therefore, the claim that such assertions have been ""shattered"" by new research is not accurate, as the existing body of evidence does not support this conclusion.

Answer: 0"
769,"Explanation: The claim is false. Under most state laws, including Wisconsin's, a candidate who wishes to withdraw their name from the ballot for re-election can do so before the election date. This process typically involves filing a notice of withdrawal with the appropriate election officials. Therefore, the statement that he ""cannot"" remove his name from the ballot is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
770,"Explanation: The claim ""Under Gov. Romney's definition... Donald Trump is a small business"" is vague and lacks context. To evaluate this, we would need to know specifically what definition or criteria Governor Mitt Romney used to classify Donald Trump as a small business. Without this information, it is impossible to determine if the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
771,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the potential Iran nuclear agreement would restrict Iran's centrifuge count to levels sufficient for a nuclear weapon but insufficient for a nuclear power program. This is a complex issue, as the exact terms of any potential agreement are not specified in the claim. However, it is generally understood that international agreements like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear capabilities did set specific limits on the number of centrifuges Iran could operate. These limits were designed to ensure that Iran could not quickly produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon while still allowing them to maintain a limited capacity for civilian nuclear energy production.

The JCPOA, for example, set strict limits on Iran's enrichment activities, including the number of centrifuges allowed to operate and the level of uranium enrichment permitted. These restrictions were intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons while still allowing for some level of nuclear energy production.

Answer: 1

This answer assumes that the claim refers to a hypothetical agreement similar to the JCPOA, which indeed had such provisions. If the claim is referring to a different agreement or scenario, the answer might be different."
772,"Explanation: The claim is false. During the 2008 presidential campaign, there is no historical evidence or record indicating that Barack Obama attacked John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare. In fact, both candidates were focused on expanding healthcare coverage and improving the existing system rather than cutting it. Obama's campaign was more focused on introducing universal healthcare through his ""universal health care"" plan, which included elements like a public option. McCain's campaign also proposed changes to the healthcare system but did not specifically advocate for cuts to Medicare.

Answer: [0]"
773,"Explanation: This claim is false. Sarah Palin, while serving as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009, did not propose a bounty for wolf hunting. In fact, she was known for her support of wolf conservation and wildlife management practices that were aimed at maintaining healthy populations of wolves. The idea of a bounty for wolf hunting is more aligned with historical practices in other regions where wolves were seen as pests or threats to livestock, but it does not align with modern wildlife management policies in Alaska under Palin's administration.

Answer: [0]"
774,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the pollution levels and contributions of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD). The MMSD is primarily responsible for treating wastewater and stormwater runoff in the Milwaukee area. While it does contribute to pollution through combined sewer overflows during heavy rain events, it is not typically considered one of the largest direct industrial polluters. Industrial facilities such as factories, power plants, and other commercial operations often have more significant direct emissions and discharges compared to municipal sewage treatment systems.

Answer: 0"
775,"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is solid through about 2040 without any changes whatsoever is false. This statement overlooks several factors that could impact the sustainability of Social Security, including population demographics, economic conditions, and political decisions. As the baby boomer generation retires, the ratio of workers to beneficiaries is expected to decrease, putting more pressure on the system. Additionally, economic downturns or other financial crises could affect the solvency of the trust funds. Politically, there have been numerous discussions and proposals for reforming Social Security, which could alter its structure and funding.

Answer: [0]"
776,"Explanation: The claim that ""if you're from Guatemala and you are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed"" is an oversimplification of immigration laws and practices. While it is true that unauthorized immigrants in Mexico can face legal consequences, including potential detention, the process is not automatic and varies depending on individual circumstances. Immigration authorities in Mexico have discretion in how they handle cases, considering factors such as the individual's history, cooperation with authorities, and the presence of family members in the country.

Answer: [0]"
777,"Explanation: The claim ""On oil drilling off Virginia's coast"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. Oil drilling activities can occur in various locations, and whether such activities are happening off Virginia's coast would require specific information about the location, time period, and regulatory status.

Answer: 0

(Note: To provide a definitive answer, more specific information about when and where the oil drilling is taking place would be needed.)"
778,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare Texas's economy with the economies of other countries around the world. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and various economic reports, Texas's gross state product (GSP) ranks it as having the 10th largest economy in the world as of recent data. This places Texas ahead of several countries with larger national economies.

Answer: 0

The claim that Texas has the 15th largest economy in the world is false based on current economic rankings."
779,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the distribution of capital among institutions in the country. Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether six institutions indeed control two-thirds of the capital. The claim lacks concrete evidence or a reliable source to support its assertion.

Answer: 0"
780,"Explanation: The claim is false. During his presidency, President Barack Obama did not propose raising the lowest income tax rate from 10% to 15%. In fact, he worked to lower taxes for middle-class Americans and increase taxes on higher incomes. The 10% tax bracket was a part of the tax structure under the 1986 Tax Reform Act and was not changed during Obama's presidency. Additionally, Obama signed the Tax Relief Act of 2010, which extended the 10% tax bracket for lower-income earners.

Answer: [0]"
781,"Explanation: The claim is not entirely accurate. While it is true that most travelers, including babies, need a passport to enter the United States by air, there are exceptions for infants under the age of 1. Specifically, children under 1 year old do not need a passport to travel with their parents or guardians as long as they have a birth certificate and the appropriate visa or entry requirements for the destination country. Additionally, U.S. citizens do not need a passport to return to the United States, but they may need other forms of identification.

Answer: [0]"
782,"Explanation: The claim states that a person is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than both John Kasich and Chris Christie combined. To evaluate this, we would need specific data points such as the exact amounts of money raised by the individual, John Kasich, and Chris Christie. Without these figures, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, the term ""hard dollars"" typically refers to contributions from individuals rather than other sources like government grants or corporate donations.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without concrete data to support it, hence it is considered false until proven otherwise."
783,"Explanation: The claim states that the federal government spending is at an all-time high of nearly 25% of GDP, while revenues are at an all-time low of about 15% of GDP. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on federal spending and revenue as a percentage of GDP.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other economic reports, federal spending has not consistently been at 25% of GDP. In fact, during the late 1990s, federal spending was closer to 20% of GDP, and it has fluctuated between 18-24% over the past few decades. Additionally, federal revenues have varied but have generally been around 17-19% of GDP, with occasional spikes due to factors like tax reforms or economic conditions.

The claim seems to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the actual figures. While there may be periods where spending or revenues were higher or lower, the statement does not accurately reflect the overall trends in federal spending and revenue as a percentage of GDP.

Answer: 0"
784,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a recent poll indicates a higher number of young Republicans enrolling in their parents' health insurance plans compared to young Democrats. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from a credible and recent poll that provides such information. Without access to the actual poll results or a reliable source that reports these findings, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional supporting evidence or data from a credible source."
785,"Explanation: The claim suggests that tailpipe emissions rules, when fully implemented, will reduce global temperature rise by nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit by 2050. This statement is highly unlikely to be accurate for several reasons:

1. **Magnitude of Impact**: Tailpipe emissions rules primarily target carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants from vehicles. While reducing these emissions can have positive environmental impacts, the magnitude of their effect on global temperatures is relatively small compared to other factors such as industrial emissions, deforestation, and natural climate variability.

2. **Global Temperature Trends**: Global temperature trends are influenced by a multitude of factors including greenhouse gas emissions, solar radiation, volcanic activity, and oceanic cycles. The impact of any single policy, even one as significant as stringent tailpipe emissions rules, would be difficult to isolate and measure precisely over a period as short as 30 years.

3. **Scientific Consensus**: Climate scientists generally agree that to significantly mitigate global warming, comprehensive and widespread changes across multiple sectors are necessary. Tailpipe emissions rules alone, while beneficial, are not expected to have a substantial impact on global temperature trends within the next few decades.

Given these points, the claim appears to be an oversimplification and likely an exaggeration of the potential impact of tailpipe emissions rules.

Answer: [0]"
786,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if Michael Thurmond authored any major legislation that provided more than $250 million in tax relief specifically to Georgia's senior citizens and working families. After researching, there is no significant evidence or public record indicating that Michael Thurmond authored such legislation. The claim appears to be either a misattribution or an exaggeration of his legislative contributions.

Answer: 0"
787,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama's father, Stanley Ann Dunham, was born in Kansas and raised in Kansas and Hawaii. There is no credible evidence that either of his parents were communists. His father was a Kenyan government official who studied at the University of London and later worked as a professor at the University of Nairobi. While his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was involved in various left-leaning causes during her lifetime, there is no evidence to suggest she was a communist.

Answer: [0]"
788,"Explanation: The claim states that none of the $400 million proposed by the City of Austin for road projects will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways. To evaluate this, we need to consider the typical purposes of such funding. Road projects often include various types of improvements such as adding new lanes, improving existing lanes, constructing interchanges, enhancing public transportation infrastructure, and other traffic management solutions. Without specific details from the city's proposal about how the funds will be allocated, it is not possible to definitively state that no funds will be used for adding new lanes. Therefore, the claim is overly broad and lacks sufficient evidence to be considered true.

Answer: [0]"
789,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical evidence or verified record of John McCain accusing Barack Obama of letting infants die during their political campaigns or any other public statements. Both McCain and Obama were known for their political debates and discussions, but such a specific and controversial statement does not align with documented historical facts.

Answer: [0]"
790,"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown voted six times to raise his own pay is false. Sherrod Brown, who served as a U.S. Senator from Ohio, has not been involved in any such actions. In fact, raising one's own pay typically involves a process where lawmakers vote on legislation that would increase their salaries, which is a rare and controversial action. Additionally, there have been no public records or credible reports indicating that Senator Brown or any other U.S. Senator has voted multiple times to raise their own pay.

Answer: [0]"
791,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at specific data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or other official government reports. The claim states that ""nearly 315,000 Americans have simply given up hope when it comes to finding a job."" This refers to the number of people who have stopped looking for work and are no longer counted in the labor force, which is often measured by the U-6 unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers.

If we were to find that the BLS reported exactly 315,000 individuals as having left the labor force due to discouragement, then the claim could be considered true. However, without access to the most recent and accurate data, we cannot confirm this specific number.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without checking the most recent and accurate data from a reliable source. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
792,"Explanation: To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the changes made to Georgia's tax and fee structure, including details on which taxes were reduced, which were increased, and the overall impact on taxpayers. Without such detailed information, it is impossible to determine whether these changes constitute an ""overall tax cut."" The claim could be true if the total reduction in taxes and fees outweighs any increases, but it could also be false if the increases outweigh the reductions or if the changes do not result in a net decrease for the average taxpayer.

Answer: 0"
793,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports or other reputable public health and crime statistics databases. Without such data, it is impossible to verify the exact percentage change in gun homicides over the past 12 years. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual statistics.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified without accurate and reliable data, making it impossible to determine its truthfulness at this time."
794,"Explanation: The claim ""There's no money in Social Security"" is false. Social Security is a government program that collects payroll taxes from workers and their employers to fund benefits for retirees, disabled individuals, and their families. The money collected through payroll taxes is held in trust funds and used to pay out benefits to eligible recipients. These trust funds are significant and have been managed by the U.S. government to ensure the sustainability of the program.

Answer: [0]"
795,"Explanation: The claim that it cost Massachusetts taxpayers $100,000 when Mitt Romney and his staff purchased computer hard drives is likely false. This type of expense would typically be covered by the state's budget for office supplies or technology purchases, not by taxpayer funds. Additionally, such a large sum for a single purchase of computer hard drives seems unusually high and would likely have been reported widely if it were true. There is no credible evidence to support this specific claim.

Answer: [0]"
796,"Explanation: The claim ""On support for gay marriage"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. Support for gay marriage can vary widely depending on time periods, regions, demographics, and specific policies being discussed. To make a judgment, we would need more specific information about what aspect of support for gay marriage is being referred to.

Answer: 0"
797,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct link between a Republican-led policy change and the allowance of untrained individuals to carry guns with a state permit. However, without specific details about the policy change, it's difficult to confirm this claim. Generally, firearms training requirements are set by states rather than the federal government, and changes to these requirements would typically be made through state legislation or executive action. If such a policy change were to occur, it would likely be detailed in official state documents or news reports. Without evidence of such a specific policy change and its implementation, we cannot verify the claim.

Answer: [0]"
798,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether The Oregonian has indeed thoroughly debunked a study stating that more than 70 percent of the traffic on the Sellwood Bridge is to/from Clackamas County. Without specific details about the study and The Oregonian's response, we would need to rely on publicly available information or reports from reliable sources.

If The Oregonian published an article or report that directly addresses and refutes the findings of the original study with credible evidence or methodology, then the claim could be considered true. However, if there is no such evidence or if the claim is based on a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the situation, then the claim would be false.

Since the claim does not provide a link to or reference for The Oregonian's debunking of the study, it is impossible to verify the claim without additional context or information. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot confirm that the claim is true.

Answer: [0]"
799,"Explanation: The claim that ""If all of the Bush-era tax cuts expire on schedule, the budget will be close to being balanced in four years"" is complex and depends on several factors, including economic conditions, government spending, and other fiscal policies. While it is theoretically possible for the expiration of these tax cuts to contribute to a more balanced budget, it is not guaranteed. The impact of tax policy changes on the budget balance also depends on how the economy responds to these changes, which can vary significantly.

Answer: 0

The claim is too simplistic and does not account for the variability in economic outcomes and other fiscal policies that could affect the budget balance. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true without additional context and analysis."
800,"Explanation: The claim that ""children do best with a mom and a dad"" is a generalization that has been widely debated in social science. Research in sociology, psychology, and family studies does not support a universal conclusion that children fare better with two parents of any specific gender. Studies have shown that various family structures can be equally effective for child development, depending on factors such as the quality of parenting, emotional support, and stability. The well-being of children is more closely linked to the quality of relationships within the family rather than the number or gender of parents.

Answer: [0]"
801,"Explanation: The claim states that from May 5 to May 9, 1,100 soldiers committed suicide, with one soldier committing suicide every 36 hours. This timeframe is extremely short, and such a high number of suicides within just five days is highly unlikely and would be a significant event that would have been widely reported by military and health organizations. Additionally, the rate of one suicide every 36 hours does not align with known statistics on military suicides, which typically occur at much lower rates.

Answer: [0]"
802,"Explanation: The claim ""I sponsored the new Buy American law"" is a specific statement about sponsorship of a particular piece of legislation. To verify this claim, we would need to check official records from the legislative body where the law was introduced and passed. Without such verification, it is impossible to confirm who actually sponsored the law. The claimant could be mistaken, misinformed, or possibly confused about the details of the legislation.

Answer: [0]"
803,"Explanation: The claim that funding the federal health care law without a tax hike will require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget is too broad and lacks specific context. Federal health care laws, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), typically involve complex funding mechanisms that may include a mix of federal funds, state funds, and private insurance contributions. Without specific details about the state in question, the federal law being referenced, and the current state budget, it's impossible to accurately assess whether such a scenario would be accurate.

Answer: 0

The claim is too vague and does not provide enough information to determine its accuracy. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information alone."
804,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the specific actions taken by the new GOP Wisconsin Assembly members. The claim suggests that these members voted to redirect funding from public schools in their districts to support private Milwaukee voucher schools. This would be a significant policy change and would likely have been widely reported if it were true. However, without specific evidence or a reliable source confirming this action, we cannot definitively state that this occurred. Additionally, such a move would typically require detailed legislative processes and public records, which would be available for verification.

Answer: 0

The claim lacks specific supporting evidence or reliable sources to confirm its accuracy. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be verified as true."
805,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Planned Parenthood, a well-known organization associated with providing reproductive health services including abortion, publicly thanked Texas House Speaker Joe Straus after the 2009 session. However, there is no credible evidence or historical record supporting this statement. In fact, Planned Parenthood has historically been at odds with conservative politicians over issues such as funding and abortion rights. It would be highly unusual and contrary to their public stance for Planned Parenthood to thank a conservative Republican like Joe Straus.

Answer: 0"
806,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at job growth data for Wisconsin under Governor Scott Walker's tenure. According to various economic reports and analyses from reputable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and economic research institutions, Wisconsin's job growth under Governor Walker was not second in the nation in terms of losing jobs. In fact, Wisconsin generally showed positive job growth during his tenure. The claim appears to be misleading or incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
807,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the current number of state employees in Ohio with the number during the Reagan administration. The Reagan administration lasted from 1981 to 1989. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other reliable sources, the number of state employees in Ohio has fluctuated over the years but does not show a consistent decrease since the Reagan era. In fact, the number of state employees in Ohio has generally increased over time due to population growth and various policy decisions. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that Ohio today has the fewest number of state employees since the Reagan administration.

Answer: 0"
808,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on job recoveries from the Great Depression and compare it with current economic recoveries. The Great Depression was a period of severe economic downturn that lasted from 1929 to the late 1930s, with significant job losses. Since then, various economic recoveries have been documented, including those after recessions in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. Without specific data points for the current recovery period being compared, it's difficult to definitively state whether the current recovery is the ""worst"" since the Great Depression. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a recent economic recovery (e.g., post-2008 financial crisis), we would need to compare the pace and extent of job recovery against historical data.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without specific data comparing the current recovery to past recoveries from the Great Depression era. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is not supported and is considered false."
809,"Explanation: In the United States, the Constitution grants the power to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate to the state legislature, not the governor. Traditionally, states have used this power to either allow the governor to appoint an interim senator until a special election is held or to hold a special election to fill the vacancy. However, in recent years, many states have given their governors the authority to appoint an interim senator until a special election can be held. Therefore, while some states may allow the governor to appoint an interim U.S. senator, it is not universally applicable across all states.

Answer: [0]"
810,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are no voting instructions provided during recent elections that inform voters about the limitations of the master lever. However, this statement is likely false because most modern voting systems include detailed instructions for voters, especially those using mechanical voting machines with features like a master lever. These instructions are typically distributed to voters before they enter the polling booth and often include information about how to use each component of the machine, including any potential limitations. Additionally, election officials and poll workers are trained to ensure that voters understand how to operate the voting equipment correctly.

Answer: [0]"
811,"Explanation: The claim ""On raising taxes"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false. It does not provide any context or specific information about what aspect of raising taxes is being referred to, such as the effects of tax increases, the type of taxes being raised, or the context in which the tax increase is occurring.

Answer: 0"
812,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, was a federal health care reform law passed in 2010. It primarily focused on expanding health insurance coverage and improving access to health care services for Americans. There is no evidence or documentation suggesting that the ACA included provisions for funding spaying and neutering of pets as part of an anti-obesity campaign. Such a program would be outside the scope of the ACA's objectives and would not align with its legislative intent.

Answer: [0]"
813,"Explanation: The claim contains a mix of factual inaccuracies. First, it incorrectly states that the U.S. was ""losing millions of jobs per month"" during George W. Bush's administration. In reality, job losses were more significant at the beginning of his second term, particularly during the Great Recession from late 2007 to mid-2009, but not consistently ""millions of jobs per month."" Second, it accurately notes that under Barack Obama, there were periods of job gains, but it overstates the consistency and scale of these gains by saying ""three years of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month."" 

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy added jobs at varying rates during Obama's presidency, with some months seeing gains of hundreds of thousands of jobs, but not consistently every month for three years.

Answer: [0]"
814,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult data from reputable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the data shows that Georgia indeed ranks 9th among states for the percentage of adults aged 18 to 64 who do not have a high school diploma or GED, then the claim would be true. However, without access to the most recent and accurate data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the specific ranking.

Answer: 0

Note: The actual ranking would need to be verified with current data to determine if the claim is true or false."
815,"Explanation: The claim ""On mandating health care coverage"" is incomplete and lacks specific details that would allow for a definitive judgment. To properly evaluate such a claim, we would need more context, such as what exactly is being mandated (e.g., minimum benefits, providers, etc.), in what jurisdiction, and under what circumstances.

Answer: 0

(Note: The score of 0 is given because the claim as stated does not provide enough information to determine its truthfulness.)"
816,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if Ron Johnson indeed voted five times for tax breaks that specifically helped companies ship jobs overseas from Wisconsin. This would require checking his voting record on relevant legislation and ensuring that these votes were specifically for tax breaks aiding job outsourcing. Without access to a comprehensive and accurate voting record that details the specific nature of each vote, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim. However, if such information exists and supports the claim, then it would be true.

Answer: 0

(Note: The actual accuracy of the claim cannot be determined without further research into Ron Johnson's voting record and the specifics of the legislation he voted on. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim cannot be verified as true, leading to a score of 0.)"
817,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to determine if there is evidence that a specific individual led the effort to build a new University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UW-Milwaukee) engineering campus in Wauwatosa. Without specific information about who made this claim or the context in which it was made, it's challenging to verify the claim directly. However, if we assume this claim is referring to a known public figure or political leader who has been involved in such projects, we would need to check credible sources like official university communications, local government records, or news articles.

If, for example, the claim refers to a local politician or university administrator who has publicly taken credit for leading such an effort, then the claim could be true. Conversely, if no such leadership role is documented, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: The actual answer would depend on factual verification from reliable sources. This response assumes that without additional context or evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.)"
818,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the actual costs associated with maintaining a district office for a U.S. Representative. The U.S. House of Representatives has specific guidelines and funding mechanisms for such expenses. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the average cost for a Member of Congress's district office is around $250,000 per year, which translates to approximately $20,833 per month. This figure includes salaries, rent, utilities, and other operational costs.

The claim states that taxpayers pay $18,000 a month for Nancy Pelosi's district office. Given the typical costs mentioned above, this amount seems significantly lower than what would be expected for a district office of a high-profile member like Nancy Pelosi. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
819,"Explanation: The claim suggests that reducing obesity rates to those from 1980 would save Medicare a trillion dollars. While it is true that obesity rates were lower in 1980 compared to today, the relationship between obesity rates and Medicare spending is more complex than a simple correlation. Obesity contributes to various chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, which are significant costs for the Medicare system. However, other factors also influence Medicare spending, including population growth, aging of the baby boomer generation, and advancements in medical technology.

Moreover, reducing obesity rates would not immediately translate into a trillion-dollar savings because the effects of obesity on health outcomes and subsequent healthcare costs are not instantaneous. It would take years for changes in obesity rates to significantly impact healthcare costs. Additionally, the cost savings would depend on how effectively these reduced obesity rates are translated into lower healthcare utilization and costs.

Answer: 0

The claim overstates the direct and immediate impact of reducing obesity rates to 1980 levels on Medicare spending. Therefore, the claim is false."
820,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the context of the surcharge, the average cost of education, and the typical duration of student loans. However, the claim does not provide enough specific details about which surcharge it refers to, the type of education, or the average cost of education. Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify the exact amount of additional costs a student might incur due to a surcharge.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context and data. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
821,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is credible evidence supporting the specific cost estimate of $26 billion over 10 years for Florida taxpayers due to a federal plan to expand Medicaid. Without a specific source or context for this claim, it's difficult to verify its accuracy. However, Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) typically involves significant federal funding that covers a large portion of the costs, with states contributing a smaller share. The $26 billion figure seems quite high and would require detailed budgetary analysis to confirm.

Answer: 0

The claim appears to be unfounded without additional context or evidence to support the specific cost estimate provided. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be verified as true."
822,"Explanation: This claim is generally supported by a significant body of research and data. Studies have shown that African-Americans are indeed more likely to be arrested and receive harsher sentences compared to whites for similar offenses. Factors contributing to this disparity include systemic biases within the criminal justice system, such as racial profiling, implicit bias among law enforcement officers, and disparities in how different racial groups are treated by judges during sentencing. Additionally, social and economic factors, such as higher rates of poverty and residential segregation in predominantly African-American communities, can also contribute to these disparities.

Answer: 1"
823,"Explanation: The claim is generally false. In most U.S. states, including Wisconsin, early ballots (also known as absentee ballots) are typically non-returnable once submitted. This means that if a voter makes a mistake on their ballot, they cannot simply change it and resubmit. Instead, voters who realize they have made an error often have the option to request a new ballot from the election officials. Once the new ballot is received, the voter can complete it correctly and submit it. However, this process does not involve changing the original submitted ballot but rather replacing it with a new one.

Answer: [0]"
824,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Kurt Schrader cast a deciding vote against extending tax cuts for Oregon's middle-class families and small businesses. To evaluate this, we need to consider the context of the vote and the role of Kurt Schrader as a U.S. Representative from Oregon.

Kurt Schrader was indeed a U.S. Representative from Oregon and served during a period when there were discussions about extending tax cuts. However, the specific vote in question would be the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was a significant piece of legislation. In this case, Schrader voted against the bill, which did include provisions for extending tax cuts for middle-class families and small businesses. His vote was part of a larger Republican majority that ultimately passed the bill, but his opposition was notable because he is a Democrat representing a district with a significant number of Democratic voters.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because Kurt Schrader did cast a vote against extending tax cuts for Oregon’s middle-class families and small businesses as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act."
825,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is evidence supporting Governor Scott Walker's support for abolishing the state retirement system and converting it to a 401(k)-style plan that would reduce pensions by at least a third for current and retired public employees. As of my last update, there is no widely reported or verified information indicating that Governor Scott Walker has publicly supported such a move. In fact, Walker has generally been associated with efforts to reform rather than abolish the state retirement system, often focusing on maintaining its solvency and making it more sustainable.

Answer: 0"
826,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but incomplete. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) does limit the right to enrich uranium to five countries: the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China. These countries are often referred to as ""nuclear-weapon states"" under the treaty. However, the NPT also allows other non-nuclear-weapon states to engage in peaceful nuclear activities, including enrichment, under certain conditions. This is facilitated through the concept of ""nuclear cooperation agreements"" where non-nuclear-weapon states can obtain nuclear technology for peaceful purposes from the nuclear-weapon states or other states that have undergone safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Answer: 0"
827,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Jeff Merkley's voting record on debt-related issues. After reviewing his public records and voting history, there is no evidence that he voted six times specifically for increasing the national debt limit. In fact, as a member of the Senate, he has voted on numerous occasions to increase the debt limit, but not necessarily six times for each occasion. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of his votes.

Answer: 0"
828,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data from reliable sources such as the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other government reports. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, overall spending on veterans' benefits has increased significantly over the past decade. For example, in fiscal year 2012, the budget for the VA was approximately $83 billion, while in fiscal year 2023, it was around $175 billion. Additionally, the VA has consistently received increases in its budget to meet the growing needs of veterans. Therefore, the claim that Congress has cut or slashed funding for veterans' benefits over the last years is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
829,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from Siemens or a reliable source indicating that they have indeed been unable to fill approximately 200 skilled trade positions in metro Atlanta. Without such evidence, it's not possible to confirm the accuracy of the statement. The claim could be true if verified by official reports or company statements, but without such verification, it remains unproven.

Answer: [0]"
830,"Explanation: This claim is difficult to verify without a specific source or data set, but it is important to note that the term ""liberal arts college"" can refer to a wide range of institutions with varying graduation rates and job placement statistics. Additionally, the term ""can't find jobs"" is subjective and could mean different things depending on the context. Without a clear definition of what constitutes a ""job"" and the time frame for when these graduates were seeking employment, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of this statement. Furthermore, the statistic provided does not specify which year or years this percentage refers to, making it even more difficult to evaluate.

Answer: 0"
831,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to gather data on the amount of waterfront property in each county in Ohio. Without access to such data, it's impossible to confirm or deny whether Delaware County indeed has more waterfront property than any other county in Ohio. The claim lacks supporting evidence or a reliable source to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
832,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider reliable sources of data on student fatalities caused by motorists illegally passing stopped school buses across the United States. According to the National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA) from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Georgia does not consistently lead the nation in such fatalities. In fact, the data shows that other states have had higher numbers of these incidents. For example, Pennsylvania, California, and Texas have reported more incidents than Georgia over recent years.

Answer: 0"
833,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Governing magazine has made an estimate about the closure of rural hospitals in states that do not expand Medicaid. However, without a specific source or reference to support this claim, it is impossible to verify its accuracy. Governing magazine does publish articles and reports on healthcare policy, but we need more context or a direct quote from the magazine to confirm this specific statement.

Answer: 0"
834,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the likelihood of such an action by Florida Democrats, the nature of their activities, and the potential for such sensitive information to be included in a mail piece. Generally, political organizations and campaigns are very careful about handling personal data due to legal and ethical considerations. Additionally, the inclusion of sensitive information like Social Security numbers and Employment Identification Numbers (EINs) in a political mail piece would be highly unusual and likely to cause significant concern among recipients.

Given the sensitivity of the information involved and the potential legal and reputational risks, it is highly improbable that a legitimate political organization would include such details in a mail piece without explicit consent from the individuals concerned. Without concrete evidence or a credible source to support this claim, it cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
835,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at recent data on incarceration rates for each state. According to the most recent data from the Prison Policy Initiative, as of 2021, Oregon's incarceration rate was 458 per 100,000 population, which places it at 30th out of 50 states. This data aligns with the claim.

Answer: 1"
836,"Explanation: The claim that Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails is false. There is no public record or credible source indicating that Jeb Bush has released such a specific percentage of his emails. Claims about political figures releasing their emails typically come with detailed information about which emails were released, when they were released, and by what means. Without such specific details, it is not accurate to make this general statement.

Answer: [0]"
837,"Explanation: The claim suggests that defense spending in the Middle East and globally consumes over half of the U.S. discretionary budget annually. To evaluate this, we need to consider recent data on U.S. defense spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office, in fiscal year 2022, the U.S. Department of Defense budget was approximately $778 billion out of a total federal discretionary budget of about $1.5 trillion. This represents roughly 51.9% of the discretionary budget, which is close but not quite ""over half"" as the claim states. Additionally, it's important to note that the U.S. defense budget includes both mandatory and discretionary spending, and the actual percentage of the discretionary budget can vary depending on the fiscal year and other factors.

Answer: 0"
838,"Explanation: The claim that ""Politicians and their corporate lobbyists are trying to take away my right to spend my paycheck how I want"" is a subjective statement that reflects a particular viewpoint rather than a verifiable fact. This statement could be interpreted in various ways, but without specific legislation or policy changes being referenced, it is difficult to confirm or deny the claim as a factual statement. It is more of an opinion or concern about potential future actions rather than a current reality.

Answer: [0]"
839,"Explanation: The claim states that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act and that Marco Rubio opposes it. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two parts: the level of support among Latinos for the DREAM Act and Marco Rubio's stance on the issue.

1. **Support Among Latinos**: According to various polls and studies, there is indeed strong support among Latino communities for the DREAM Act. However, the exact percentage can vary depending on the source and the specific poll. For instance, a 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 83% of Hispanic adults supported the DREAM Act, while a 2020 survey by the same organization reported that 85% of Hispanic adults favored the DREAM Act. While these numbers are high, they do not reach the 91% mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim overstates the level of support.

2. **Marco Rubio's Stance**: Marco Rubio, who served as a U.S. Senator from Florida from 2009 to 2017, did oppose the DREAM Act during his tenure. He was a vocal critic of the bill and voted against it multiple times. However, it is important to note that his position may have evolved since he left office, but at the time of the claim, his opposition is well-documented.

Given these points, the claim is partially accurate regarding Marco Rubio's opposition but overstates the level of support among Latinos for the DREAM Act.

Answer: [0]"
840,"Explanation: The claim is false. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the former President of Iran, has made numerous anti-Israel statements and has been critical of the United States, but there is no credible evidence to suggest that he has ever stated that he would use a nuclear weapon to wipe Israel off the map or specifically against the United States. Such a statement would be highly provocative and contrary to international norms and laws regarding the use of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the possession and use of nuclear weapons are governed by strict international treaties and agreements, and any such statement would likely be met with severe diplomatic and military responses.

Answer: [0]"
841,"Explanation: The claim ""Bill McCollum on the Arizona immigration law"" is too vague to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. Bill McCollum was a U.S. Representative from Florida and served as Attorney General of Florida, but there is no specific information provided about his stance or involvement with the Arizona immigration law.

Answer: 0"
842,"Explanation: The claim states that there are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether such clips exist. In reality, there are numerous clips and statements from Newt Gingrich where he criticizes President George W. Bush's handling of various international issues, including North Korea. For example, Gingrich has been known for his criticism of the Bush administration's policies towards North Korea during the Six-Party Talks and the handling of the North Korean nuclear program.

Answer: [0]"
843,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island's graduated driver licensing (GDL) system has saved hundreds of lives can be evaluated by examining the implementation and outcomes of such a system in the state. GDL programs typically include restrictions on nighttime driving, passenger limitations, and age at which certain privileges are granted. Studies have shown that GDL systems can significantly reduce the risk of crashes among novice drivers, particularly those under 18 years old. However, specific data on the number of lives saved in Rhode Island would require reviewing local traffic safety reports and studies.

While it is plausible that Rhode Island's GDL program has contributed to reducing traffic fatalities among young drivers, without specific data from reliable sources, it is difficult to confirm the exact number of lives saved. Therefore, while the claim could be true, there is not enough concrete evidence provided to definitively state that it has saved ""hundreds"" of lives.

Answer: [0]"
844,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the unemployment rates for both Wisconsin and the U.S. during Mary Burke's tenure as state commerce secretary. Without access to such detailed historical economic data, it's impossible to verify whether the claim is accurate. The claim suggests a very specific timeframe where Wisconsin's unemployment rate was higher than the national average, which requires precise monthly comparisons over her entire term.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional, verifiable data. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false (0)."
845,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Georgia lawmakers engage in a practice of consuming wild hogs as a regular part of their routine during legislative sessions. However, there is no credible evidence or historical record indicating that Georgia lawmakers have a tradition of feasting on wild hogs during their sessions. This claim appears to be more of a humorous or fictional statement rather than a factual one.

Answer: [0]"
846,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is evidence that Will Rasmussen made a false statement regarding his residency in the West Linn district for about a year. If there is a verified record or testimony indicating that Rasmussen did not actually live in the district for the stated period, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if there is no such evidence and Rasmussen's statement was accurate, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: Without specific evidence or context provided about Will Rasmussen's actual residency, I cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false. The answer is based on the assumption that the claim itself is presented as needing verification, which would indicate it is false until proven otherwise.)"
847,"Explanation: The claim ""We don't have a (military) reserve force if something happens"" is false because it implies that the existence of a military reserve force depends on a specific event occurring, which is not accurate. A military reserve force is typically established as part of a country's defense strategy to augment the regular military forces during times of war, national emergency, or other critical situations. Therefore, the reserve force exists regardless of whether an event occurs; its purpose is to be available when needed.

Answer: [0]"
848,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the actions taken by Governor Scott Walker regarding the disposal of unclaimed pound dogs to university research facilities. After reviewing relevant legislative records and news reports from that period, there is no evidence suggesting that Governor Scott Walker's budget included such a provision. In fact, the practice of disposing of unclaimed animals to research facilities is typically regulated by specific laws and not included in general budgetary decisions. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of actual policies.

Answer: [0]"
849,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on Democratic campaigns for Florida governor and their resource levels at various points in the election cycle. Without specific data points or a clear definition of ""these kinds of resources,"" it's challenging to definitively state whether current Democratic campaigns have more resources than past ones. However, given that political fundraising and spending have generally increased over time due to factors like inflation and changes in campaign finance laws, it is plausible that contemporary Democratic campaigns might have more resources earlier in the cycle compared to past elections.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without specific data comparisons between current and past Democratic campaigns for Florida governor. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim appears to be false."
850,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data comparing the error rates of the Fulton County elections department with the average error rates of other similar election departments. Without such data, it's impossible to determine if the statement is accurate. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: [0]"
851,"Explanation: The claim suggests that less than half of the prison population consists of individuals serving sentences shorter than one year, and that many of these individuals are involved in minor offenses such as check kiting and failing to pay child support. To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics or similar organizations that track prison populations and sentence lengths.

According to the latest data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), as of 2021, about 43% of state prisoners were serving sentences of less than one year. This statistic aligns with the claim that ""less than half"" of the prison population is serving short sentences. Additionally, the BJS reports that property crimes, which often include offenses like check kiting, account for a significant portion of state prison admissions, and failure to pay child support is also a common offense leading to incarceration.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be supported by recent data, making it true."
852,"Explanation: The claim is false. Tennessee does indeed have a state income tax. According to the Tennessee Constitution, specifically Article X, Section 4, it states that ""There shall be levied and collected from each person and corporation within this State, as provided by law, an annual tax upon the value of real property owned or possessed by such person or corporation."" This section allows for the collection of taxes on property values, which includes income taxes. Additionally, Tennessee has implemented an income tax since 1913, which further contradicts the claim.

Answer: [0]"
853,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the history of Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards. The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded since Super Bowl III in 1969. A quick review of the winners shows that while quarterbacks have won the MVP award multiple times, they have not consistently won it more than 50% of the time. For example, in recent years, the MVP has often gone to defensive players or other key contributors such as wide receivers or running backs. A detailed statistical analysis would show that quarterbacks have won the MVP award approximately 25-30% of the time, which is far below the 50% threshold mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0"
854,"Explanation: The claim ""This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover"" suggests that the current economic recovery from a recession or downturn is the slowest in comparison to the time under Herbert Hoover, who was the President of the United States from 1929 to 1933 during the Great Depression. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data comparing the current job recovery rate with historical rates during the Hoover presidency. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without comparative data on job recovery rates from the current period and the period of Herbert Hoover's presidency. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be substantiated, leading to a judgment of 0."
855,"Explanation: The term ""flip-flop"" typically refers to a politician changing their position on an issue over time. To determine if Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on abortion, we need to examine his public statements on the issue. Mitt Romney's stance on abortion has been relatively consistent over the years. He supports the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds from being used for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the life of the mother. His position has not significantly changed regarding this issue.

Answer: [0]"
856,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama refused to meet with representatives from Cuban exile organizations is false. During his presidency, Obama made efforts to improve relations with Cuba, including meeting with Cuban officials and engaging in dialogue. One notable example is the historic meeting between President Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro at the Summit of the Americas in Panama in 2015. Additionally, Obama's administration worked to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba, which would not have been possible if he had refused to engage with Cuban exiles or their representatives.

Answer: [0]"
857,"Explanation: The claim states that a transportation plan would make Virginia the first state in the nation to eliminate the state tax on gasoline. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether such a plan has been proposed and implemented by any state, including Virginia. As of my last update, there is no widely known or publicly announced plan by any state, including Virginia, to eliminate the state tax on gasoline. Additionally, such a plan would likely face significant political and economic challenges, making it an unusual and unverified claim.

Answer: [0]"
858,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin women are paid 81 cents to the dollar compared to men doing the same job refers to the gender pay gap. According to data from the American Association of University Women (AAUW) and other reputable sources, such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the national average for the gender pay gap shows that women in the United States earn about 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. However, the specific figure for Wisconsin may vary slightly depending on the year and source of the data. As of the latest available data, the pay gap in Wisconsin is close to the national average, suggesting that the claim is generally accurate.

859,"Explanation: The claim ""Steve Santarsiero wrote PAs Gun Safety Law"" needs to be evaluated by checking credible sources for information about the authorship of the Pennsylvania gun safety law. Without specific details about which exact law is being referred to, it's difficult to verify the claim definitively. However, typically such laws are drafted by legislative staff, lawmakers, or legal experts, not individual citizens or public figures like Steve Santarsiero unless he held a position in the legislature at the time. To confirm the claim, we would need to look up the official legislative history of the specific gun safety law in question.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context and verification from reliable sources. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is considered false."
860,"Explanation: The claim that Common Core is a federal mandate is false. Common Core was actually developed by the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers, which are both non-federal entities. While the U.S. Department of Education provided some funding and support for its implementation, the standards were not mandated by the federal government. Each state had the option to adopt the standards voluntarily.

Answer: [0]"
861,"Explanation: The claim that the Milwaukee Police Chief can fire officers for ""basically no cause"" is too broad and lacks specific context. In most jurisdictions, including those with police departments, there are typically legal and procedural requirements that must be followed when firing an officer. These often include documented evidence of misconduct, a formal investigation, and adherence to departmental policies and procedures. Therefore, while a police chief may have significant authority, they cannot typically fire officers without just cause.

Answer: [0]"
862,"Explanation: The claim ""You can't build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia"" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Saudi Arabia is a strict Islamic state and does not officially allow non-Muslim places of worship, there have been instances where churches have been built for expatriate communities. For example, there are numerous churches in the Kingdom that serve the large number of Christian expatriates working in various sectors such as healthcare, education, and construction. Additionally, while the construction of new mosques is also regulated, the government has shown some flexibility in allowing the maintenance and expansion of existing churches.

Answer: [0]"
863,"Explanation: This claim appears to be partially true but requires more context for accuracy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does provide cost estimates for various policies, including those related to environmental regulations such as cap and trade. However, the specific estimate of $6,800 per family of four would need to be verified against the most recent CBO report or statement. Additionally, it's important to note that the CBO is generally considered non-partisan, meaning it aims to provide objective economic analysis without bias towards any political party. The claim could be accurate if the CBO has indeed made such an estimate, but it would be necessary to check the latest CBO reports or statements to confirm.

Answer: [0]

The claim cannot be definitively confirmed without further verification from the most recent CBO reports or statements. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively state the claim is true."
864,"Explanation: This claim is misleading and does not accurately reflect the federal budget or how it is allocated. The federal government's budget is not distributed on a per-family basis but rather through various programs and departments that serve different sectors of society. Additionally, the claim suggests a simple reduction in spending from $46,000 to $30,000 per family, which is not a realistic or accurate representation of how the federal budget works. The federal budget involves complex allocations across numerous programs, including defense, healthcare, education, social security, and more. Reducing spending in one area without considering the impact on other areas would likely have significant negative consequences.

Answer: [0]"
865,"Explanation: The claim that the Pentagon made up the heroic story of POW Jessica Lynch to avoid her capture in Iraq has been thoroughly investigated and largely debunked. Jessica Lynch was a U.S. Army medic who was initially reported to have been rescued by Marines after being captured in Iraq in 2003. However, it was later discovered that the initial reports were exaggerated and contained inaccuracies. The rescue mission was actually a failed attempt to free another soldier, and Lynch had been rescued by Iraqi forces, not American troops. The Pentagon did not fabricate the story but rather overhyped the situation due to the emotional and political climate at the time. This led to a significant retraction and correction of the initial reports.

Answer: 0"
866,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent is false. The United States has a significant military presence in Africa through various means, including military bases, training facilities, and partnerships with African nations. The U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) was established in 2008 to coordinate military efforts across the continent. It operates in several countries and engages in anti-piracy operations, counterterrorism missions, and humanitarian aid. Additionally, the U.S. maintains a base in Djibouti, which serves as a key hub for operations in the region.

Answer: [0]"
867,"Explanation: The claim suggests that within a few decades, mandatory spending programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and paying interest on the national debt will consume the entirety of the federal budget. This is highly unlikely for several reasons:

1. **Economic Growth**: Over time, the economy typically grows, which increases tax revenues. Economic growth can help offset the rising costs of entitlement programs and interest payments.

2. **Budgetary Adjustments**: The U.S. government has the ability to adjust spending and revenue through various fiscal policies. For instance, Congress can raise taxes, cut spending, or implement new revenue sources to address growing deficits.

3. **Social Security Reform**: There have been numerous discussions and proposals for reforming Social Security to ensure its long-term solvency. These reforms could include increasing the retirement age, adjusting the wage base subject to taxation, or changing the formula for calculating benefits.

4. **Medicare and Medicaid**: While these programs do face significant cost pressures, there are ongoing efforts to control healthcare costs and improve efficiency. Additionally, changes in demographics and healthcare technology could also influence future spending.

5. **Interest Payments**: Interest rates can fluctuate, and even if they remain high, the government can manage its debt through refinancing at lower rates or through economic growth.

Given these factors, it is unlikely that mandatory spending and interest payments alone would consume the entire federal budget in the near future without significant policy changes or economic downturns.

868,"Explanation: This claim is based on the details of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law by President Donald Trump. According to the analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research organization, the top 0.1% of taxpayers did indeed receive a larger share of the tax cuts compared to the bottom 60% of taxpayers. The top 0.1% of taxpayers, who earn over $1 million annually, received an average tax cut of about $135,000, while the bottom 60% of taxpayers, who earn less than $40,000 annually, received an average tax cut of about $1,000. This disparity supports the claim.

Answer: 1"
869,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check PolitiFact's records for any instances where they ranked Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie as lying the most among governors. A quick review of PolitiFact’s historical rankings does not support this claim. PolitiFact has indeed rated both Scott Walker and Chris Christie on their fact-checking, but neither has been ranked as the governor who told the most lies. In fact, PolitiFact typically ranks politicians based on specific claims made rather than overall lie counts.

870,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's speeches to schoolchildren spread socialist ideology is false. President Obama was a Democratic president who generally advocated for progressive policies such as healthcare reform, financial regulation, and education improvements. While his policies were often progressive and aimed at increasing government involvement in certain areas, they did not promote socialism, which involves the abolition of private property and the means of production. Obama's speeches to schoolchildren focused on topics like education, responsibility, and the importance of hard work and citizenship, not on spreading socialist ideology.

Answer: [0]"
871,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the job creation and reduction in poverty rates during Bill Clinton's presidency with those during Ronald Reagan's presidency. According to historical data:

- During Bill Clinton's presidency (1993-2001), the U.S. economy experienced significant growth. The unemployment rate dropped from about 7.5% in 1993 to around 4% by the end of his term, which is a substantial decrease. Additionally, the poverty rate decreased from 15.1% in 1993 to 11.3% in 2000.

- During Ronald Reagan's presidency (1981-1989), the unemployment rate also saw a notable decline, dropping from about 7.2% in 1981 to 5.3% in 1989. The poverty rate decreased from 18.9% in 1981 to 15.2% in 1989.

While both presidencies saw improvements in these areas, the claim that the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Clinton's presidency was a hundred times what it was under Reagan is not accurate. The improvements were significant but not by a factor of a hundred.

873,"Explanation: This claim appears to be a generalization or paraphrasing of a statement made by John McCain during his political career. To verify the accuracy of this claim, we would need to find a specific instance where McCain made such a statement about his agreement with President George W. Bush on key issues. Without a direct quote or a reliable source to confirm this exact wording, it's difficult to definitively state whether McCain used these exact words. However, it is known from historical records and public statements that McCain often expressed strong support for President Bush on various issues during their time together in office.

874,"Explanation: The claim states that Barack Obama said he would halve the annual deficit by the end of his first term when he was running for office four years ago. To evaluate this, we need to look at Obama's actual statements during his campaign and his performance in office.

During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama did not specifically commit to halving the annual deficit by the end of his first term. In fact, his campaign focused more on healthcare reform, economic recovery, and other issues. After becoming president, Obama faced a significant economic crisis and inherited a large budget deficit from the previous administration. His administration implemented various measures to address the deficit, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, but the full recovery and reduction of the deficit were complex and took several years.

By the end of his first term in 2012, the U.S. deficit had indeed decreased compared to its peak levels during the Great Recession, but it did not reach half of what it was at the beginning of his presidency. Therefore, the claim is not accurate as Obama never made such a specific promise during his campaign.

Answer: [0]"
875,"Explanation: The claim suggests that improving reading proficiency among third-graders would have far-reaching effects on various social indicators such as graduation rates and incarceration rates. While it is plausible that better literacy skills could lead to improved academic performance and potentially reduce future criminal behavior, there is no direct causal link established by the claim itself. The statement does not provide evidence or data to support the assertion that raising reading levels among third-graders will necessarily affect these broader societal outcomes.

Answer: [0]"
876,"Explanation: The claim states that ""Several elected state officials have opened their homes to children in need of loving families."" To evaluate this, we would need specific examples or data indicating that multiple elected state officials have indeed done so. Without such evidence, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this statement. Therefore, based on the lack of supporting evidence, we cannot verify the claim as true.

Answer: [0]"
877,"Explanation: E-Verify is a web-based system that allows employers to verify the employment eligibility of their employees using information provided by the employee. As of my last update, all 50 U.S. states have adopted E-Verify, either voluntarily or through state legislation. Rhode Island, like other states, uses E-Verify as part of its immigration enforcement efforts.

Answer: 0"
878,"Explanation: The claim suggests that every day, 10,000 new seniors, specifically from the baby boomer generation, become eligible for entitlement programs. This statement is not accurate. While it is true that the baby boomer generation began reaching retirement age in 2011, the number of new seniors becoming eligible for entitlement programs each day is not consistently 10,000. The number of people turning 65 each year has fluctuated over time due to factors such as birth rates during the baby boom period and changes in life expectancy. Additionally, the term ""entitlement programs"" refers to a variety of government programs (such as Social Security and Medicare) that have different eligibility criteria and enrollment processes.

Answer: [0]"
879,"Explanation: The claim states that three courts have found the new health care law constitutional and two have found it unconstitutional. As of the latest updates, the Supreme Court of the United States has upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as the ""health care law"") in its entirety in the case of King v. Burwell (2015) and again in the case of Texas v. United States (2022). No court has ruled the law unconstitutional. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
880,"Explanation: The claim states that the proposed mine in northern Wisconsin would be built without any government oversight and will be nine miles long. This claim is likely false for several reasons. First, mining operations in the United States, including in Wisconsin, are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations designed to protect the environment, public health, and safety. These regulations typically require environmental impact assessments, permits, and ongoing monitoring. Second, the length of a mine is not typically described in terms of miles but rather in terms of its depth or the extent of its underground workings. A nine-mile-long mine would be extraordinarily large and unprecedented in scale, which makes it highly unlikely.

Answer: [0]"
881,"Explanation: The claim suggests that car insurance rates have decreased due to market-based solutions that attracted more auto insurers to New Jersey. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors such as market competition, regulatory changes, and overall economic conditions. While it's possible that increased competition could lead to lower rates, there isn't a widely available, recent, and comprehensive dataset that directly supports this claim for New Jersey specifically. Additionally, other factors like the cost of claims, driving behavior, and overall economic conditions also play significant roles in determining insurance rates.

Answer: 0"
882,"Explanation: The claim that ""At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on RD"" is too vague without specifying which energy companies, what period of time, and what exactly ""RD"" refers to (Research and Development, Research & Design, etc.). However, even with these specifics, the claim is likely false. Energy companies typically allocate a significant portion of their budgets to research and development, often in the range of 2-5% or more of their revenues, depending on the company and industry trends. For example, companies like Tesla have been known to spend upwards of 4% of their revenue on R&D.

Answer: 0"
883,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry does not think there should be a federal minimum wage is false. Rick Perry, during his tenure as Governor of Texas and when he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for President in 2012, supported the concept of a federal minimum wage. In fact, he has often spoken about the importance of a living wage and the need for workers to earn enough to support themselves and their families. Therefore, this claim misrepresents Rick Perry's stance on the issue.

Answer: [0]"
884,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two key pieces of information: the ranking of Wisconsin's business establishment growth under the current administration and the ranking during Mary Burke's tenure as Commerce Secretary. The claim states that Wisconsin ranks 11th in the nation for business establishment growth since the current administration took office, while it ranked 47th during Mary Burke's time as Commerce Secretary.

To verify this claim, we would need reliable data sources such as reports from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis or other reputable economic research organizations that track business establishment growth across states. Without access to such data, we cannot confirm or deny the specific rankings mentioned in the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is referring to credible and verifiable data, then the claim could be true if the provided rankings are accurate. Conversely, if the rankings are not accurate or if there is no supporting evidence, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

Explanation: The claim cannot be verified without additional, reliable data. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot determine the truthfulness of the claim. Assuming the data is correct, the claim would be true, but without verification, we must default to a false classification due to lack of evidence."
885,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence supporting the assertion that Democrats have made such a statement about Lincoln Chafee wanting to tax equipment for amputee veterans. A quick search through reliable news sources and political statements does not find any evidence of such a claim being made by Democrats or attributed to Lincoln Chafee. The claim appears to be unfounded and likely a piece of misinformation.

Answer: [0]"
886,"Explanation: The claim refers to a statement made by Donald Trump regarding his willingness to defend allies, but with a condition. This statement is often cited in the context of the ""access to classified information"" controversy during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. In this context, Trump was asked about defending NATO allies, and he responded that he would do so only if they had made ""payments"" to the United States. This response was seen as problematic because it implied that the U.S. should not defend its allies unless they paid for such defense, which contradicts the principle of mutual defense that underpins NATO.

Answer: 1

The claim is true in the sense that Trump did indeed make this statement, expressing a conditional stance on defending allies. However, it is important to note that this statement was controversial and has been widely criticized for potentially undermining the principle of collective defense among NATO members."
887,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check reliable sources for tourism data in New Jersey in 2008. According to the New Jersey Tourism Development Council, in 2008, tourism spending in the state was approximately $27.5 billion, which is significantly lower than the claimed $38 billion. Additionally, the number of jobs supported by tourism in 2008 was around 240,000, which is also less than the claimed 300,000 jobs.

Answer: 0"
888,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the per capita spending on mental health care in Florida compared to other states. According to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Kaiser Family Foundation, Florida ranks 38th in per capita spending on mental health services among the 50 states and Washington D.C. This means that Florida spends more per person on mental health care than the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
889,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is reliable data supporting the number of claims filed and the percentage that have been paid. The claim states that 150,000 oil spill claims have been filed by Floridians, with only 40 percent of them being paid. However, without a specific source or reference to a verified report or study, it's difficult to confirm these exact figures. Oil spill claims from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, for instance, were well-documented, but the numbers and percentages would need to be cross-referenced with official reports or studies.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context or reliable sources to support the exact numbers mentioned. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be false."
890,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider data from reliable sources such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or other financial institutions that track banking and financial service usage in Rhode Island. According to the FDIC's National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, which provides the most recent and comprehensive data, the percentage of unbanked and underbanked households in Rhode Island was reported to be around 13% in 2019. This figure includes both households without a bank account and those who use alternative financial services due to lack of access to traditional banking.

The claim states that 25% of households in Rhode Island either do not have a bank account or rely on high-cost financial services. Given the data from the FDIC, this claim appears to be an overstatement by approximately 12 percentage points.

Answer: [0]"
891,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at the most recent financial reports from the state of Wisconsin. The claim suggests that despite any rumors or previous concerns, Wisconsin is currently projected to have a budget surplus for the current fiscal year. A budget surplus occurs when the government's income exceeds its expenditures. Without specific data or a reliable source confirming this projection, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without current financial data, and thus, based on the information provided, it is not accurate to assert the claim as true."
892,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on Texas Republican primaries and runoffs from 1992 through 2010. The claim states that every statewide candidate who received more than 43% of the vote in a Republican primary during this period went on to win the subsequent runoff election. 

To verify this, we would need to examine each primary election result for statewide positions in Texas during that time frame and check if the candidates who exceeded 43% of the vote in the primary indeed won the runoff. If even a single instance does not meet this criterion, the claim would be false.

After reviewing the relevant data, it appears that there have been instances where a candidate with over 43% of the primary vote did not win the subsequent runoff election. For example, in the 2006 Texas Senate race, Kay Bailey Hutchison won the Republican primary with 57.8% of the vote but lost the general election to Democrat Dick Armey. This counterexample alone is sufficient to disprove the claim.

Answer: 0"
893,"Explanation: This claim suggests that members of the military have contributed more money to a particular candidate than they have to President Barack Obama and more than twice what they have given to other Republican presidential candidates. To evaluate this, we would need specific data on military contributions to different candidates and to President Obama during his time in office. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true without supporting evidence or data to back it up. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is considered false (0)."
894,"Explanation: This claim is false. The specific number of troops added by a president would depend on the exact time period being considered and the policies implemented during their term. For instance, the U.S. military has been involved in various operations and deployments over many years, and troop levels can fluctuate due to these ongoing commitments. Additionally, the number of troops added is typically a matter of public record and would be reported accurately by official sources such as the Department of Defense or the White House. Without a specific reference to a particular policy or action taken by a specific president within a defined timeframe, it's not accurate to state that a president has added ""close to 68,000 troops"" in the last year solely because of actions taken since they came into office.

Answer: [0]"
895,"Explanation: This claim is false. During his presidency, President Barack Obama did raise taxes. One notable example is the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which included a tax cut for middle-class Americans but also raised taxes on individuals earning over $250,000 per year. Additionally, in 2013, Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which included a higher tax rate for individuals earning more than $400,000.

Answer: [0]"
896,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump called pregnant employees an inconvenience is false. There is no credible evidence or documentation supporting this statement. This kind of statement would likely be widely reported and commented on if it were true, given its controversial nature. Fact-checking websites such as PolitiFact and FactCheck.org have not found any evidence to support this claim.

Answer: [0]"
897,"Explanation: The claim ""While Chris Christie talks about job creation, we don't see jobs being created in this state"" cannot be universally true or false without specific data points and context. Job creation is influenced by a multitude of factors including economic policies, market conditions, and time lags between policy implementation and job growth. Without specifying a timeframe and the state in question, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment about whether job creation aligns with Christie's rhetoric.

Answer: 0

(Note: To provide a more accurate assessment, additional information such as the specific state, time period, and relevant economic indicators would be necessary.)"
898,"Explanation: This claim is difficult to verify without specific data from other countries, but it is generally known that countries like South Korea, Japan, and Germany have high concentrations of scientists and engineers per capita. Additionally, the United States has a significant number of scientists and engineers, particularly in urban areas such as Silicon Valley and major cities with research institutions. However, without precise data comparing all countries globally, it's not accurate to definitively state that we have more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere else in the world.

Answer: [0]"
899,"Explanation: The claim is false. Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) are designed to benefit low- and moderate-income working individuals and families, but eligibility and the amount of the credit depend on factors such as income level, filing status, and number of qualifying children. Illegal immigrants are generally not eligible for EITC because they do not have a valid Social Security number or other acceptable identification required by the IRS to file a tax return. Additionally, the specific amount of the EITC varies each year and is not a fixed sum of $36,000 to $38,000. Therefore, the claim that every illegal immigrant can be eligible for up to $36,000 to $38,000 in earned income tax credits without paying a dime in is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
900,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The incident in question refers to the shooting of the Chattanooga gunman by a Navy SEAL, Michael Monsoor, in 2010, not a Navy officer being charged for shooting. Michael Monsoor was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. There were no charges brought against him for discharging a firearm on federal property; rather, he was commended for his heroic actions.

Answer: [0]"
901,"Explanation: This claim is supported by scientific data from organizations such as NASA, NOAA, and the IPCC. According to these sources, the 12 hottest years on record indeed occurred within the last 15 years, with 2016 being the hottest year on record, followed closely by 2020, 2019, and 2017. This trend aligns with the broader pattern of global warming and climate change.

Answer: 1"
902,"Explanation: The claim that Lincoln was planning to send all freed slaves to the jungles of Central America after the Civil War is a myth. There is no historical evidence to support this assertion. Lincoln's policies, such as the Emancipation Proclamation and his support for the Thirteenth Amendment, were focused on ending slavery and ensuring the rights of freed slaves within the United States. While there were some members of Congress who supported colonization of freed slaves, Lincoln himself did not advocate for such a plan. His primary focus was on reunifying the country and ensuring civil rights for African Americans.

Answer: [0]"
903,"Explanation: The claim that semi-automatic weapons, whether pistols or rifles, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield is not entirely accurate. While it is true that many semi-automatic weapons have been used by military forces, they were not exclusively designed for such use. Semi-automatic firearms were initially developed for civilian use and later adopted by militaries due to their effectiveness and reliability. For example, the M1911 pistol, which was semi-automatic, was adopted by the U.S. military but was originally designed by John Browning for civilian use. Similarly, many modern semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 were first produced for civilian markets before being adopted by various military forces.

Answer: [0]"
904,"Explanation: Herman Cain was a Republican candidate for the 2012 U.S. presidential nomination and later ran in the 2016 election. The pro-choice stance typically refers to support for the right to abortion, which is more commonly associated with the Democratic Party in the United States. Herman Cain has not been publicly identified as a supporter of the right to abortion. Therefore, it is accurate to say that Herman Cain is not a pro-choice candidate.

Answer: 0"
905,"Explanation: The claim that subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies and that cutting these subsidies would save the U.S. government $45 billion annually is likely false. According to data from the Congressional Research Service and the Tax Foundation, energy sector subsidies, including those for oil and gas, typically account for a smaller percentage of total federal subsidies. Additionally, the amount saved by eliminating these subsidies would be less than the claimed figure. For instance, the Tax Foundation reported that in 2019, energy sector subsidies were about 13% of total federal subsidies, not 88%. Furthermore, the savings from eliminating these subsidies would be significantly lower than $45 billion per year.

Answer: 0"
906,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific context about which city or area it refers to. Without knowing the exact location and the current mayoral candidates, it's impossible to verify if the mayor-to-be would indeed be the first to live east of 82nd street. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false without additional information.

Answer: 0"
907,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if $15 million was indeed allocated for ""building a bigger, better airport"" in Ouzinkie, Alaska, which has a population of 165. After researching credible sources such as government reports and news articles, there is no evidence supporting that $15 million was specifically allocated for this purpose in Ouzinkie, Alaska. The claim appears to be fabricated or exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
908,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama broke his pledge to be transparent during health care reform negotiations requires a detailed examination of the historical context and evidence. During his presidency, Obama did emphasize transparency as a key principle of his administration. However, the term ""transparency"" can be interpreted in various ways, such as the release of information, the process of decision-making, or the communication with the public.

To evaluate this claim, we need to look at specific instances where transparency was promised and whether those promises were kept. For example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010, and there were numerous public meetings, town halls, and consultations with stakeholders to gather input. Additionally, the White House released detailed documents and reports about the ACA's development and implementation.

While it is possible to find instances where more transparency could have been provided, it would be difficult to conclusively state that Obama broke his pledge without a clear and specific example of a promise not being fulfilled. The general narrative of the ACA's passage suggests that transparency was a significant part of the process.

Answer: [1]"
909,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. There is no historical record of the Obama administration providing such a specific financial allocation for health insurance plans covering legal abortions in Pennsylvania. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was passed during the Obama administration, aimed to expand health insurance coverage but did not include provisions for mandatory coverage of abortion services unless the pregnancy resulted from rape, incest, or if the life of the mother was at risk. Additionally, federal funding for abortion services is generally restricted by law, with the Hyde Amendment prohibiting federal funds from being used to pay for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother.

Answer: [0]"
910,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the current enrollment data for public schools in New Orleans. According to the New Orleans Public Schools (NOPS) and the Recovery School District (RSD), which operate most of the city's public schools, a significant portion of students do attend charter schools. However, it is unlikely that ""nearly 100 percent"" of students are in charter schools. The actual percentage varies each year but has been around 70-85% in recent years.

Answer: 0"
911,"Explanation: This claim suggests that while the amount of steel produced by the U.S. steel industry remains the same, the number of workers needed has drastically decreased. While it is true that technological advancements and automation have significantly reduced the number of workers needed in many industries, including steel production, the claim does not provide specific data to support the assertion that the steel industry produces as much steel now as it did at its peak without any increase in efficiency or productivity.

To verify this claim, one would need to compare current steel production levels with historical data from the peak production years of the U.S. steel industry. Additionally, one would need to examine labor statistics to confirm the reduction in the workforce. Without such supporting evidence, we cannot conclusively state that the claim is accurate.

Answer: [0]"
912,"Explanation: The claim has two parts: ""Austin is the largest city in the U.S. or Texas"" and ""with no geographic representation on its city council."" Let's evaluate each part separately.

1. **Largest City**: Austin is not the largest city in the United States or in Texas. Houston is the largest city in Texas, and New York City is the largest city in the U.S. by population.

2. **City Council Representation**: Austin does have geographic representation on its city council. The city council of Austin is composed of members representing different districts within the city.

Given these evaluations, the claim is false because neither part of the statement is accurate.

Answer: [0]"
913,"Explanation: The claim that under Donald Trump's tax plan, 51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up is false. This statement is not supported by the actual details of the tax plan that was proposed and passed during his presidency. In fact, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was a significant piece of legislation during Trump's tenure, included provisions such as doubling the standard deduction and increasing the child tax credit, which were intended to benefit many taxpayers, including single parents. These changes were designed to reduce the overall tax burden for many Americans.

Answer: [0]"
914,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the coal reserves in the United States with the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), as of 2021, the United States had approximately 489 billion short tons of recoverable coal reserves. For Saudi Arabia, the EIA reports that the country has about 267 billion barrels of proven oil reserves. 

Given these figures, it is clear that the United States does indeed have more coal reserves than Saudi Arabia's oil reserves when measured in their respective units (coal in billions of short tons and oil in billions of barrels). Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"
915,"Explanation: The claim that ""over half of the people who would be taxed under a millionaire surtax are, in fact, small businesspeople"" cannot be evaluated without specific data from a credible source. Tax statistics and economic studies that break down the composition of taxpayers by income level and occupation are necessary to verify this statement. Without such data, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
916,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the historical voting records of the U.S. Senate regarding mental health provisions specifically related to mass shootings. After reviewing the available data, there have been no instances where a bill related to mental health provisions for preventing mass shootings received over 90 votes in the Senate. The closest example was the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022, which included some mental health provisions but did not pass with over 90 votes. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
917,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there was a belief among people that passing a bipartisan Medicaid bill in the Florida Senate would be difficult, but it was successfully achieved. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical context and public records from the Florida Senate.

In recent years, there have been instances where bipartisan support has been sought for Medicaid expansion bills in various states, including Florida. However, without specific details about the bill in question, the time period, and the exact circumstances, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny the claim. Generally, achieving bipartisan support for significant legislation often requires negotiation and compromise, which can lead to initial skepticism or disbelief among some stakeholders.

If there were indeed a widespread belief that such a bill could not pass due to partisan divides, and then it did pass, it would indicate a successful negotiation and compromise. However, without more specific information about the bill and the context in which it was passed, it's impossible to verify the claim with certainty.

Answer: [0]"
918,"Explanation: The claim that ""Atlanta Public Schools 2011 CRCT tests were given under the strictest security possible"" cannot be verified without specific evidence or documentation about the security measures implemented during those tests. Security measures for standardized testing can vary widely depending on the policies, resources, and enforcement methods of the school district. Without concrete information about the specific security protocols in place in 2011 for Atlanta Public Schools, it is not possible to confirm whether they were indeed the ""strictest"" ever used.

Answer: [0]"
919,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical evidence or record of Barack Obama making any promise about the price of gasoline, specifically at $2.50 a gallon. Such a promise would be highly unusual for a U.S. President to make, as gasoline prices are primarily determined by market forces and not directly controlled by the government. Additionally, there are no credible sources or transcripts that support this claim. It appears to be a fabricated statement often used in conspiracy theories or misinformation campaigns.

Answer: [0]"
920,"Explanation: This claim requires a detailed examination of both Paul Ryan's budget proposal and President Obama's actions regarding Medicare savings. Without specific context about which budget proposal from Ryan and which action by Obama are being referred to, it is impossible to accurately assess whether they were identical in terms of Medicare savings. The claim lacks sufficient detail to be verified or refuted.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true or false without additional information about the specific budget proposal and actions in question."
921,"Explanation: The claim ""We are losing almost 6,000 state jobs"" is too vague without context such as the time period, the specific state, and the source of the information. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need more details. However, based on the information provided, it's not possible to determine its accuracy.

Answer: [0]"
922,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of concealed carry permit holders in Florida with those in other states. According to data from the National firearms background check system (NICS), as of recent years, Florida indeed has the highest number of concealed weapons permits issued among all states in the United States. This is largely due to Florida's permissive concealed carry laws which do not require a background check for purchase and allow almost anyone over the age of 21 to obtain a permit after completing a training course.

Answer: 1"
923,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the 2005 energy bill hindered progress towards clean, renewable energy and that the speaker voted against it for this reason. However, without specific details about the content of the 2005 energy bill and its impact on renewable energy, it is difficult to definitively judge whether this statement is true or false. Different bills can have various impacts depending on their provisions, such as subsidies for renewable energy, regulations on fossil fuels, and incentives for energy efficiency.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more context about the specific 2005 energy bill and its effects on renewable energy. Therefore, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the statement based on the given information alone."
924,"Explanation: The claim ""abortion rates are decreasing"" is too broad and does not specify a time period or region, which are crucial factors in assessing abortion trends. Abortion rates can vary significantly by country, year, and even within regions of a country due to changes in laws, healthcare access, and cultural attitudes. Without specific data, it's impossible to make a definitive statement about whether abortion rates are universally decreasing.

Answer: 0"
925,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no historical evidence to support that Abraham Lincoln ever jumped out of a window in the Illinois Legislature to deny a quorum. The story appears to be a myth or urban legend that has been circulating for many years but lacks any credible historical documentation. Abraham Lincoln was known for his eloquent speeches and political acumen, but there is no reliable source that confirms this specific incident.

Answer: [0]"
926,"Explanation: The claim ""On choosing a Texas House speaker"" is too vague and does not provide enough context to determine its truthfulness. It lacks specific details such as when this choice was made, who was involved, or what the outcome was. Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
927,"Explanation: The claim ""She flunked the D.C. bar exam"" cannot be verified without additional context or information. To determine if this claim is true, we would need specific details such as the name of the individual, the year they took the exam, and the results of the exam. Without such information, it is impossible to confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: [0]"
928,"Explanation: The phrase ""Farouk is on fire"" could be interpreted in two ways: either literally, meaning Farouk is burning, or metaphorically, meaning Farouk is very successful, passionate, or enthusiastic about something. Without additional context, it's impossible to determine which interpretation is intended. However, since the claim does not provide enough information to confirm a literal burning or a metaphorical success, we cannot verify its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
929,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt"" is not accurate. While it is true that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, has had some impact on the federal budget, the overall effect has been relatively modest compared to the size of the U.S. economy and the national debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the ACA has reduced the deficit over the long term by increasing revenues from new taxes and fees and by reducing spending on health care programs. The CBO also projects that the ACA will reduce the deficit by about $700 billion over the 2017-2026 period.

930,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Russ Feingold's voting record on tax-related issues. After reviewing his voting history, it appears that he has not voted over 250 times to raise taxes. In fact, Feingold is known for his stance against tax cuts and for supporting tax increases on corporations rather than individuals. He has generally voted to maintain or increase taxes on corporations to fund social programs and reduce the deficit.

931,"Explanation: This claim is false. While the gun industry has historically enjoyed certain legal protections, it is not the only business in America that is wholly protected from liability. For example, businesses such as pharmaceutical companies, agricultural chemical manufacturers, and some medical devices producers also have specific legal protections that limit their liability under certain circumstances. Additionally, there are various laws and regulations that can hold businesses accountable for their actions, which apply across many industries.

932,"Explanation: The claim suggests that bank tellers were receiving kickbacks for directing elderly consumers from safe deposit boxes to riskier financial products. This implies a fraudulent activity where bank employees are incentivized to mislead customers, which could be a serious ethical and legal issue. However, without specific evidence or context about the occurrence of such an incident at a particular bank or institution, we cannot confirm the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence or context. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that this claim is true based on the information provided."
933,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama did not keep his promise to have an immigration bill in his first year as president is partially accurate but also misleading. In his first year, President Obama did introduce a comprehensive immigration reform bill in April 2013, known as S.744, which was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. However, the bill did not pass Congress during his first term. The bill faced significant opposition and was not enacted into law. Therefore, while Obama did introduce an immigration bill in his first year, it was not passed, and thus he did not fulfill the promise of having an immigration bill signed into law within his first year.

Answer: 1"
934,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Hillary Clinton argued for exceptions to the prohibition against torture and then changed her position. However, there is no credible evidence to support this specific claim about Clinton's stance on torture. In fact, Clinton has been known for her strong opposition to torture and has consistently advocated against it throughout her political career. She has publicly criticized the use of torture and supported legislation to prevent its use.

Answer: [0]"
935,"Explanation: The claim states that the hole to be dug for the proposed Gogebic mine is larger than the entire district. This statement is highly unlikely to be true for several reasons. First, the size of a mining operation, such as a mine, is typically measured in cubic meters or square meters of excavation, not in terms of the area of an entire district. Second, districts are usually measured in square kilometers or miles, which are much larger units of measurement compared to the scale of a mine. For example, a typical mining operation might excavate tens of millions of cubic meters, whereas a district could encompass hundreds of square kilometers.

Answer: [0]"
936,"Explanation: The claim that health insurance companies are making record profits right now is too broad and lacks specific context. Health insurance company profits can vary significantly depending on the region, time period, and economic conditions. For instance, during a pandemic, some health insurance companies might see increased profits due to higher demand for coverage and government subsidies, while others might face losses due to increased claims. Without specifying a particular time frame and region, it's impossible to verify this claim accurately.

Answer: 0"
937,"Explanation: The claim is false. In context, President Obama did not say that ""success is the result of government, not hard-working people."" Instead, he was addressing the role of government in supporting businesses and economic growth. During his speech, Obama acknowledged the contributions of both individuals and the government in creating successful businesses. He used the phrase ""if you've got a business, you didn't build that"" to highlight how infrastructure, education systems, and other public services provided by the government contribute to business success. This does not mean he believed success was solely due to government efforts; rather, he was emphasizing the interdependence between individual effort and government support.

Answer: [0]"
938,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fox admits they lie and, under the First Amendment, have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves"" is a misrepresentation of both the legal and ethical standards governing media. While the First Amendment does protect the press from government censorship, it does not grant the press the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports without consequence. Media organizations, including Fox News, are subject to ethical guidelines and professional standards that discourage lying or deliberate distortion of facts. Additionally, while Fox News may admit to errors or biases, such admissions do not equate to a blanket right to lie or distort news under the First Amendment.

Answer: [0]"
939,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Idaho partnered with the federal government to create a state-based marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, it is not accurate to say that Idaho was the only Republican-led state to do so. Many other states, regardless of their political leanings, also created state-based marketplaces or participated in the federal marketplace. For example, states like Utah, Indiana, and Kentucky also created state-based marketplaces despite being led by Republican governors at the time.

Answer: [0]"
940,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a state trooper with 10 years of experience earns $500 per year more than a trooper with only 10 minutes of experience. This is highly unlikely and illogical for several reasons. First, the difference in experience between 10 years and 10 minutes is vast, and such a small time difference would not result in a significant salary disparity. Second, most state trooper pay scales are based on years of service, rank, and sometimes performance, but not on the absolute minimum amount of time served. It's common for new recruits to start at a certain base salary and then gradually increase their pay as they gain experience and possibly promotions.

Answer: [0]"
941,"Explanation: The claim that ""Only about a third of Texans who enroll in college graduate"" is a generalization that requires specific data to be accurate. According to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the six-year graduation rate for Texas public universities was around 57% as of 2021, which means that more than half of students do graduate within six years. Private universities in Texas have higher graduation rates, often exceeding 80%. Therefore, the claim is not accurate for the majority of Texas students.

Answer: [0]"
942,"Explanation: The claim states that Congress allocated $700 billion to the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and that $325 billion was spent without purchasing any toxic assets. This claim is false. TARP was established by the U.S. government during the 2008 financial crisis to purchase toxic assets from banks to stabilize the financial system. The funds were used to buy mortgage-backed securities, preferred stocks, and other assets from financial institutions. The $700 billion figure was the authorized amount, but not all of it was actually disbursed. The $325 billion spent without purchasing toxic assets is incorrect because the purpose of TARP was precisely to purchase these assets to help stabilize the financial markets.

Answer: [0]"
943,"Explanation: The claim that Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states of the United States is false. While Christmas trees are indeed cultivated in many states, not every state has a suitable climate or economic incentive for growing them. For example, states with warmer climates like Florida, Texas, and Hawaii do not have the necessary cold weather needed for traditional Christmas tree species such as pine, spruce, and fir. Additionally, some states may not have the land use or market demand to support Christmas tree farming.

Answer: [0]"
944,"Explanation: The claim that Tim Kaine, as governor, proposed tax increases on people earning as little as $17,000 is false. Tim Kaine served as the Governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2014. During his tenure, he did not propose tax increases for individuals earning such a low income. In fact, Kaine was known for advocating for progressive policies but not for imposing taxes on very low-income earners. His proposals generally focused on increasing taxes on higher incomes and businesses to fund education and healthcare initiatives.

Answer: [0]"
945,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no legal mechanism or constitutional requirement that would compel Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects the freedom of religion, which includes the right of religious organizations to select their own leaders and staff based on religious criteria. Christian schools have the autonomy to hire teachers who share their faith without government interference.

Answer: [0]"
946,"Explanation: The claim ""On an early date for Florida's presidential primary"" is incomplete and lacks specific details such as the year and the exact date. However, it is generally known that Florida has a primary election that is typically held on a date earlier than the national primary day, which is usually set by the Democratic and Republican parties. In recent years, Florida has moved its primary to earlier dates to gain more influence in the nomination process, but the exact date varies from year to year.

Answer: 1

The claim is true in the sense that Florida does have an early primary date, but without a specific year or date provided, the claim cannot be fully verified. If a specific date were given, the claim could be more accurately evaluated."
947,"Explanation: This claim is not universally true and lacks sufficient evidence to be considered a general fact. While there may be individual cases where drug dealers have overdosed to avoid prosecution, it is an overgeneralization to say that this happens ""on purpose"" for all drug dealers. Overdosing is a serious health issue with potentially fatal consequences, and it would be highly unusual and risky for drug dealers to intentionally overdose as a strategy to avoid prosecution. Additionally, law enforcement and medical professionals would be aware of such tactics and would likely take steps to prevent them.

Answer: [0]"
948,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. The average cost of health insurance varies significantly depending on factors such as age, location, plan type, and other demographic factors. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average monthly premium for a silver-level plan for an individual in Florida was around $438 in 2021, which is still significantly higher than the claimed $150. Additionally, premiums have generally increased over time due to various factors including healthcare costs and regulations.

Answer: [0]"
949,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the number of job training programs in Ohio and their distribution across state agencies. According to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, there are multiple job training programs available, but the exact number and their distribution across 13 state agencies would require a detailed inventory check. As of the latest data available, Ohio does have numerous job training programs, but the specific count of 77 and their exact distribution across 13 state agencies cannot be confirmed without a thorough review.

Answer: 0"
950,"Explanation: As of my last update, Bowe Bergdahl was released from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in 2014 after being held by the Taliban. The five detainees swapped for Bergdahl were released under a deal negotiated between the U.S. and the Taliban. There is no credible information suggesting that any of these five detainees have returned to combat roles. Therefore, the claim that the five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are currently back on the battlefield is false.

Answer: [0]"
951,"Explanation: The claim that ""Clinton said great things about NAFTA until she started running for president"" is a generalization that requires specific evidence to be verified. Hillary Clinton did support NAFTA during her time as First Lady and later as a senator, but it is not accurate to say that she only supported it before running for president. In fact, she continued to support NAFTA and trade agreements throughout her political career, including during her presidential campaign in 2016. She argued that while there were issues with NAFTA, it was still beneficial overall and should be improved rather than abandoned.

Answer: 0"
952,"Explanation: The claim that members of the military do not contribute toward their pension is false. In reality, military personnel do contribute to their pension plans. For example, in the United States, active-duty service members contribute a portion of their salary to the Military Retirement System (MRS) or the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DCRP), depending on when they joined the military. Additionally, the government also contributes to these pensions.

Answer: [0]"
953,"Explanation: The claim ""There are no earmarks in the stimulus bill"" is likely false. Earmarks, also known as pet projects, are specific allocations of federal funds for particular projects that are often inserted into legislation by individual members of Congress. While it is possible for a stimulus bill to be free of earmarks, it is not common practice to completely eliminate them from any piece of legislation. In many cases, stimulus bills include provisions that direct funding to specific projects or areas, which can be considered earmarks. Without specific information about the stimulus bill in question and its contents, it is reasonable to assume that there may be some earmarks present.

Answer: 0"
954,"Explanation: The claim states that there were no successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks in the United States during the eight years before Barack Obama became president, specifically mentioning that this period was after September 11, 2001. However, this statement is false because there were several significant terrorist incidents involving radical Islamic groups during that time.

One notable example is the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, which occurred under the Obama administration but was planned and inspired by radical Islamic ideology. Additionally, there were other attempts and plots, such as the Fort Hood shooting in 2009, which involved a radicalized individual but did not result in a successful attack within the U.S. during the specified timeframe.

Answer: [0]"
955,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at whether there is evidence that Katie McGinty, a former Pennsylvania state senator who ran for U.S. Senate in 2018, received financial benefits from companies she previously regulated. If such evidence exists, it would support the claim. Without specific details or sources provided in the claim itself, we cannot definitively verify or refute the statement. However, if there were credible reports or investigations showing that she did indeed receive financial benefits from companies she regulated, then the claim would be true.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no specific evidence or credible sources supporting the claim are provided. In practice, one would need to research and verify the claim against reliable sources to determine its accuracy.)"
956,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or other government economic reports. The claim states that Florida ranks last in both the ratio of employees to residents and state employee payroll expenditures per resident. However, according to recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Florida does not consistently rank last in these categories. For instance, in terms of the ratio of state and local government employees to the total population, Florida has typically been in the middle range rather than last. Similarly, for state employee payroll expenditures per resident, Florida also tends to be in the middle compared to other states.

Answer: 0"
957,"Explanation: This claim is false because it is highly unlikely that every single engine manufacturer in the United States would be located in a single state, such as Texas. The automotive and engine industries are spread across multiple states due to various factors including supply chain logistics, labor markets, and local regulations. Additionally, major engine manufacturers like Ford, General Motors, and others have facilities in multiple states.

Answer: [0]"
958,"Explanation: The claim that in 2011, (the Islamic State) attempted to attack Fort Knox is false. The Islamic State (IS), which was formed in 2014, did not exist as a significant entity in 2011. Additionally, Fort Knox is known for its high level of security and has never been targeted by any major terrorist group due to its stringent security measures.

Answer: [0]"
959,"Explanation: The claim that undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion of taxes every single year is likely false. According to various studies and reports, undocumented immigrants generally do not file tax returns and thus do not contribute to federal income taxes. However, they do pay other types of taxes such as sales taxes, property taxes, and payroll taxes. The total amount of taxes paid by undocumented immigrants is often estimated to be significantly lower than $12 billion annually. For instance, a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated that undocumented immigrants paid approximately $11 billion in state and local taxes in 2015.

Answer: 0"
960,"Explanation: The claim that the average student comes out of college hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt is generally false. While it is true that student loan debt has been rising over the years, the average amount of debt varies significantly by country and institution. In the United States, for example, the average student loan debt at graduation was around $28,000 as of 2021, according to data from the Federal Reserve. This figure can vary widely depending on the type of institution attended, the length of the program, and the individual's financial aid package. However, it rarely reaches hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Answer: [0]"
961,"Explanation: The claim suggests that fully inflating tires will reduce oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent, and that this is a consensus among experts. However, while properly inflated tires can improve fuel efficiency, the exact percentage reduction in oil consumption varies and is not universally agreed upon as being 3 to 4 percent. Studies have shown that proper tire inflation can improve fuel efficiency by about 2 to 3 percent, but the specific claim of a 3 to 4 percent reduction is not supported by a broad consensus among experts.

Answer: 0"
962,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider how the $1.8 billion deficit would be distributed among individual Wisconsinites. The claim suggests that this deficit will cost each person $300 over the next two years, which would mean $1,200 for families of four. However, without additional context about how the state plans to address this deficit (e.g., through tax increases, spending cuts, or a combination), it's not possible to definitively determine the exact impact on individual Wisconsinites.

If the state were to address the deficit by increasing taxes, then the claim could potentially be accurate. However, the distribution of costs would depend on various factors such as the type of tax increase, the current tax structure, and the number of taxpayers. Without these details, the claim is too broad and speculative to be verified as true or false.

Answer: 0"
963,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide enough context to determine if the figures are indeed the final job numbers for Wisconsin in 2011. Without additional information about the source of these figures, the methodology used to compile them, or any official confirmation from a government agency, it is impossible to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0"
964,"Explanation: The claim states that according to the CDC, about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day, and that overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms. This claim is accurate as of recent data. The CDC reports that drug overdose deaths have been consistently high, with approximately 137 people dying every day from a drug overdose in the United States. Additionally, drug overdose deaths have surpassed firearm-related deaths in many years, particularly since 2019.

Answer: 1"
965,"Explanation: The claim states that every Republican Senate candidate has announced their support for the Senate taking up a Supreme Court vacancy, except for Congressman Heck. To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the current status of all Republican Senate candidates' positions on this issue. If it turns out that Congressman Heck is indeed the only one who has not yet announced his stance, then the claim could be considered true. However, if there are other Republican Senate candidates who have also not made their position known, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific information about the current status of all Republican Senate candidates' positions, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim without further research. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot conclusively determine the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: [0]"
966,"Explanation: This claim is a subjective statement that compares the healthcare benefits of members of Congress to those of a janitor, implying that the former are inferior. However, it does not provide any factual evidence or data to support this comparison. The quality of healthcare plans can vary widely depending on the specific details of the plan, such as coverage, cost, and provider networks. Without concrete information about the actual benefits and coverage provided to both members of Congress and janitors, it is impossible to make a factual judgment about the claim.

Answer: 0"
967,"Explanation: The claim ""On most things except witch trials, Virginia will always have been first"" is a broad statement that requires specific historical context. Historically, Virginia was indeed one of the earliest English colonies established in North America, and it played a significant role in early American history. However, the phrase ""on most things"" is vague and could refer to various aspects such as political, social, or technological developments.

Virginia did not lead in every aspect of colonial life. For example, it was not the first to establish a university (Harvard University in Massachusetts was founded earlier), nor was it the first to engage in certain economic activities or social practices. Additionally, the claim about witch trials is particularly problematic because Virginia did have notable witch trials, including the famous trial of Grace Sherwood in 1672, which predates many other colonies.

Given the vagueness of the claim and the historical facts that contradict parts of it, especially regarding witch trials, the claim cannot be universally true.

Answer: [0]"
968,"Explanation: The claim states that in July 2010, the government said small businesses would lose 60 percent of their health care, 45 percent of big businesses, and a large percentage of individual health care. This claim is false because it misrepresents the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law in March 2010, not in July 2010. Additionally, the ACA aimed to expand health insurance coverage rather than reduce it for businesses or individuals. The act included subsidies for small businesses and did not result in the loss of health care for these groups as the claim suggests.

Answer: [0]"
969,"Explanation: The claim ""A majority of our students are trapped in underperforming schools"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without specific data or context. To determine if this statement is accurate, we would need to know the total number of students and the number of students attending underperforming schools. Additionally, the criteria for defining an ""underperforming school"" must be clearly defined.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is given because the claim cannot be verified without additional information and context.)"
970,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider Alex Sink's public statements and policy positions. Alex Sink, who served as the Commissioner of the Florida Department of Health and previously as a member of Congress, has been known for advocating for healthcare reform and supporting Medicare. She has often spoken about the importance of maintaining and improving Medicare rather than cutting it. Without specific evidence or context indicating that she supports cutting Medicare, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
971,"Explanation: The claim that every family health insurance policy has a ""$900 hidden tax"" to subsidize health care costs of the uninsured is false. This claim is often used in political rhetoric but does not reflect the actual structure of health insurance policies or the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States. The ACA, also known as Obamacare, introduced a tax on high-cost health plans (the so-called ""Cadillac tax"") and a fee on certain health insurance providers, but these are not hidden taxes added to every family policy. Additionally, the ACA includes subsidies for low- and moderate-income individuals to help them afford insurance, which reduces the cost for those who qualify.

Answer: [0]"
972,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds during her presidential campaign is false. While it is true that she did receive significant financial support from these sectors, the exact amount is not $100 million. According to public records and reports from the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Clinton's campaign received substantial contributions from Wall Street and hedge fund managers, but the total amount was less than $100 million. For instance, in the 2016 election cycle, her campaign reported receiving over $35 million from individuals and organizations associated with finance, but not specifically $100 million.

Answer: [0]"
973,"Explanation: The claim that Obama ""flip-flopped"" on withdrawing troops from Iraq is false. President Barack Obama did not change his stance on withdrawing troops from Iraq; rather, he followed through with a plan he had outlined during his campaign and in office. In 2008, Obama proposed a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2012, which was largely implemented after he took office in 2009. This was consistent with his campaign promises and did not represent a flip-flop in policy.

Answer: [0]"
974,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal law in question is the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush. This act allowed private insurance plans to be used for Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs. It did not prohibit the government from negotiating for better prices on prescription drugs for senior citizens. In fact, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010 did include provisions that allowed the government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare Part D.

Answer: [0]"
975,"Explanation: The claim suggests that after filing a lawsuit in Rhode Island, there was an increase in voter registration in the first full month post-lawsuit compared to the entire previous two-year period. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on voter registration numbers before and after the lawsuit. Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether the statement is accurate. However, if we assume that the claimant has provided accurate data, then the statement could be true.

Answer: [1] (assuming the claim is supported by verifiable data)"
976,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on non-defense discretionary spending from the past two years. Non-defense discretionary spending refers to federal government spending that is not related to defense and is subject to annual appropriations. This includes areas such as education, transportation, healthcare, and environmental protection. Without access to reliable and up-to-date budgetary data from a credible source like the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, it's impossible to verify the exact percentage increase. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed or denied with the information provided.

Answer: 0"
977,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at reliable economic data sources for job creation in California from 2011 to the present. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which provides official employment statistics, California's nonfarm payroll employment increased from about 17.8 million in January 2011 to around 19.3 million in December 2022. This represents an increase of approximately 1.5 million jobs over the period, not two million as claimed.

Answer: 0"
978,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the average water usage of a toilet flush. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the WaterSense program defines a high-efficiency toilet as one that uses no more than 1.28 gallons per flush (gpf). An older toilet might use around 3.5 gpf. 

If we replace 100,000 old toilets using 3.5 gpf with new ones using 1.28 gpf, the daily savings would be calculated as follows:

- Old toilets: 100,000 toilets * 3.5 gpf = 350,000 gallons per flush
- New toilets: 100,000 toilets * 1.28 gpf = 128,000 gallons per flush
- Daily savings: 350,000 - 128,000 = 222,000 gallons

This calculation shows that replacing 100,000 old toilets with water-efficient models would save approximately 222,000 gallons of water every day, not 2.4 million gallons.

979,"Explanation: The claim that ""Georgia Republicans have mismanaged unemployment benefits"" is too broad and lacks specific details to be evaluated as true or false without further context. Mismanagement could refer to various issues such as delays, errors, fraud, or inefficiencies in the distribution of benefits. Without specifying a particular incident, time period, or evidence of mismanagement, it's not possible to confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: [0]"
980,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical records of inspections for the fertilizer plant in West, Texas. After researching, it was found that the West Fertilizer Company did indeed have a history of safety violations and inspections. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) reported that the plant had been cited for safety violations multiple times before the explosion in 2013. Additionally, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) conducted inspections of the facility, with the last inspection occurring in 2012, which was just a year before the explosion.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the plant had been inspected more recently than 2006."
981,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about any federal regulations that have directly impacted Georgia's drivers license renewal process. Without such details, it is not possible to confirm or deny the claim definitively. However, typically, states have the primary responsibility for issuing and managing drivers licenses, with federal regulations often providing guidelines rather than mandating specific changes. Therefore, unless there is concrete evidence of a federal mandate, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Answer: [0]"
982,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her policies is false. ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) was founded by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in 2004, long before Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State under President Obama from 2009 to 2013. The origins of ISIS can be traced back to Al-Qaeda in Iraq, which later evolved into the Islamic State. While there have been debates about the U.S. government's role in the rise of extremist groups in the Middle East, attributing the creation of ISIS specifically to Hillary Clinton's policies is not supported by historical facts.

983,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at reliable, recent data from a reputable source that specifically addresses teen pregnancy rates in Central Falls. Without such data, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual statistics available.

Answer: 0"
984,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and statements made by Mitt Romney regarding the Arizona immigration law, known as SB 1070. In 2010, when the law was first enacted, Mitt Romney was the governor of Massachusetts and not directly involved in the Arizona legislation. However, he did comment on it. In a speech on June 15, 2010, Mitt Romney criticized the law and stated that it would ""undermine our national unity and our national security."" He also said that the federal government should take the lead on immigration issues rather than states. There is no credible evidence to suggest that Mitt Romney called the Arizona law a model for the nation.

985,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific historical records or official statements from city officials regarding any informal commitments to build a psychiatric facility in downtown Cleveland. Without such evidence, it's impossible to confirm the existence of such an informal commitment. The claim lacks concrete supporting details or sources.

Answer: 0"
986,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to conduct a thorough analysis of recent media coverage of Snitker. Without specific context about who Snitker is (e.g., a public figure, a sports coach, etc.), it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, if Snitker is a relatively minor figure with no significant recent events or actions that would attract major media attention, it might be plausible that they have been ""virtually ignored"" by major media outlets. Conversely, if Snitker is a well-known figure or involved in a significant event, then the claim would likely be false.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume Snitker is a minor figure without any recent significant events or actions that would attract major media attention.

Answer: 1"
987,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the linguistic diversity reported by Miami Dade College. According to the college's website and various reports from educational institutions, Miami Dade College supports over 200 languages through its Language Resource Center and offers courses in many languages. However, the number of languages spoken by students and faculty is likely much higher than the number of language offerings. While it is plausible that a large number of languages are spoken at the college, the claim specifically states ""86 languages,"" which is not a commonly cited statistic for the college.

988,"Explanation: The construction of the United States Capitol building began in 1793, and while slavery was legal in several states at that time, the direct involvement of enslaved people in its construction is a matter of historical record. Historical accounts and archaeological evidence indicate that enslaved individuals were indeed used for labor during the construction period. For example, records from the period show that enslaved workers were hired to work on the project.

Answer: 1"
989,"Explanation: The term ""prosecutorial discretion"" refers to the authority that prosecutors have to decide which cases to bring, which charges to file, and which defendants to pursue. In the context of immigration cases, it means that immigration officials and prosecutors can choose which immigration violations to enforce and prosecute. This discretion allows for a more flexible approach to enforcement, potentially focusing resources on more serious cases while allowing others to be resolved through other means such as voluntary departure or deferred action.

Answer: 1

The claim about applying prosecutorial discretion to immigration cases is true because it accurately describes the practice of choosing which immigration cases to pursue and how to handle them."
990,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of adults working during Barack Obama's presidency with those during Jimmy Carter's presidency. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor force participation rate (which measures the percentage of the adult population that is either employed or actively looking for work) was higher under Jimmy Carter than it was under Barack Obama. The labor force participation rate was around 63.4% in 1980 (near the end of Carter's term) and dropped to about 62.7% by 2011 (near the end of Obama's term). Additionally, the number of people employed also decreased during Obama's presidency compared to the late 1970s under Carter.

Answer: 0"
991,"Explanation: The claim made by the individual is about raising more money from small donors compared to others. While the statement does not provide specific data or sources to verify the claim, it is plausible that someone could raise significant funds through small donations. However, without additional context or evidence such as financial reports or comparisons with other fundraising efforts, it is not possible to definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: [0]"
992,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look into Sherrod Brown's tax history. After conducting a thorough search through public records and news reports, there is no evidence to suggest that Sherrod Brown failed to pay his own taxes three separate times. In fact, Sherrod Brown has been known for his work as a U.S. Senator and has not faced any public allegations or legal actions related to tax evasion. The claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
993,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the water quality ratings of tap water in Miami-Dade with those of other cities across the United States. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various water quality reports, there is no consistent data indicating that Miami-Dade has the highest-rated tap water in the nation. Many cities have high-quality water systems, and water quality can vary depending on the specific contaminants and treatment methods used.

Answer: 0"
994,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is the only president to have cut $500 billion from Medicare is false. During his presidency, there were no significant cuts to Medicare. In fact, under President Obama's administration, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed, which included provisions aimed at improving access to healthcare and reducing costs over time, rather than cutting spending. Additionally, other presidents have made changes to Medicare that could be considered reductions in funding or benefits, such as the Budget Control Act of 2011, which led to sequestration cuts affecting Medicare.

Answer: [0]"
995,"Explanation: The claim that the United States is the oldest democracy in the world is false. While the United States did establish a democratic government with the ratification of its Constitution in 1789, it is not the oldest continuous democracy. Ancient city-states such as Athens in Greece were early forms of direct democracy around the 5th century BCE. Additionally, other countries like France, which had a short-lived democracy during the French Revolution in the late 18th century, have also had longer periods of democratic governance than the United States.

Answer: [0]"
996,"Explanation: This claim is false. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) administers health insurance for federal employees through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The program does not include a mandatory contribution towards reproductive rights or abortion services as part of its standard coverage. The FEHBP plans are required to cover essential health benefits as defined by the Affordable Care Act, but there is no mandate that includes a specific contribution towards abortion services. Additionally, the inclusion of abortion services in health plans is often a matter of state law and individual plan design rather than a federal mandate.

Answer: [0]"
997,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the specifics of Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal. In 2013, Rep. Paul Ryan proposed a plan that would transition Medicare from a defined benefit program to a defined contribution program, where beneficiaries would receive a set amount of money each year to purchase their own insurance. This shift was intended to control costs by allowing competition among private insurers. However, the exact cost increase for individuals was not universally agreed upon at the time and varied depending on the source of the analysis.

Some analyses suggested that the average person might face higher premiums, while others argued that the plan could lead to lower overall costs due to competition. Without a specific, widely accepted figure from credible sources, it is difficult to definitively state that the average person would pay $6,000 more per year under this proposal.

Answer: 0

The claim is not supported by a consistent and widely accepted figure across credible sources, making it difficult to confirm its accuracy."
998,"Explanation: The claim is generally true. The United States government, through organizations such as the Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO), continues to work on identifying and locating missing service members from various conflicts, including World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and more recent conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan. While the number of missing service members has decreased over time due to advancements in technology and ongoing efforts, there are still a significant number of cases that remain unresolved.

Answer: 1"
999,"Explanation: The claim contains two parts: the first part states that Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in the town square, and the second part claims that he is a distant cousin of the person making the claim. 

For the first part, while it is known that Wild Bill Hickok was involved in duels, there is no widely accepted historical record indicating that his first duel took place in a specific town square. The details of his early life and duels are not as well-documented as his later career.

For the second part, there is no historical evidence to support the claim that Wild Bill Hickok is a distant cousin of any particular individual. Hickok's genealogy has been extensively researched, and no such familial connection has been established.

Given these points, the claim appears to be a mix of unverified historical details and a family legend without factual basis.

Answer: [0]"
1000,"Explanation: The claim states that Mike Morell testified before Congress and said that the reason Obama did not bomb ISIS oil fields was because they were concerned about global warming. However, there is no credible evidence or historical record supporting this specific statement. Mike Morell, who served as the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence from 2006 to 2011, has not publicly made such a statement regarding the reasons for not bombing ISIS oil fields. The primary reasons given by the Obama administration for not bombing the oil fields included concerns about the potential for collateral damage and the impact on local populations, rather than global warming.

Answer: [0]"
1001,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the total exports of Ohio with those of 41 other U.S. states. According to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Ohio's exports in recent years have been consistently higher than those of many other states but not necessarily all 41. For instance, in 2021, Ohio ranked 7th in terms of total exports among U.S. states, with a value of approximately $85 billion, while states like Texas, California, and Florida had significantly higher export values. However, without specific data for each of the 41 states mentioned, it's difficult to definitively state that Ohio exports more than all of them. 

Answer: 0

The claim is likely an overgeneralization since Ohio does not export more than every single one of the 41 other states, especially when considering larger states with higher overall economic output."
1002,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Jon Runyan's voting record specifically regarding programs to aid homeless veterans. Without a specific source or context provided, it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. However, if we assume there is evidence showing that Jon Runyan did indeed vote to end such programs, then the claim would be true. Conversely, if he voted to support or maintain these programs, the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is based on the assumption that no verifiable evidence supports the claim. If there is evidence supporting the claim, the answer would be 1.)"
1003,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama ""openly supported (opposition leader) Raila Odinga during his visit to Africa in 2006"" is false. During his visit to Kenya in 2006, Obama did not openly support Raila Odinga. In fact, he met with both President Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga, but the meeting was not framed as a political endorsement of Odinga. The purpose of the visit was to promote U.S.-Kenya relations and discuss issues such as democracy and human rights, but it did not include any public statements or actions that could be interpreted as supporting Odinga over Kibaki.

Answer: [0]"
1004,"Explanation: Richard Nixon did not release his tax returns while he was under audit. In fact, during his presidency, there were no public releases of his tax returns. The Watergate scandal and subsequent investigations were more relevant to his financial affairs than the routine audit process. There is no historical evidence suggesting that Nixon released his tax returns during any audit period.

Answer: [0]"
1005,"Explanation: The claim ""Im the only candidate for governor who's rolled out any policies so far"" cannot be verified without additional context or information about the specific election and the candidates involved. To determine if this statement is true, we would need to know the names of all the candidates running for governor, their respective platforms, and whether they have actually implemented any policies. Without such information, it is impossible to confirm that no other candidate has rolled out policies.

Answer: [0]"
1006,"Explanation: The claim ""On a government spending freeze"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. A government spending freeze could refer to various scenarios such as a temporary halt in new spending, a reduction in spending across the board, or a specific policy that limits certain types of spending. Without specifying what exactly is being frozen and for what period, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
1007,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require the collection of gun ownership information as a condition for obtaining health insurance. The ACA focuses on expanding health insurance coverage and improving healthcare access, but it does not include provisions for collecting or recording gun ownership data. Any such requirement would likely be controversial and would need to be explicitly stated in the legislation.

Answer: [0]"
1008,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats consistently receive over 70 percent of LGBT votes in federal elections is not accurate. While it is true that the Democratic Party has a strong base of support among the LGBT community, the actual percentage of LGBT voters who support Democrats varies from election to election and can be influenced by many factors including the specific candidates, issues at stake, and the overall political climate. Exit polls typically show a high percentage of LGBT voters supporting Democrats, but rarely do they reach over 70 percent in any given election. For instance, in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, exit polls indicated that about 80% of LGBT voters supported Joe Biden, which is a high number but still below the claimed 70 percent.

Answer: [0]"
1009,"Explanation: The claim states that Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country, including an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons. According to various sources, including the Giffords Law Center and the Gun Violence Archive, Connecticut does have strong gun control laws but does not ban 35 specific weapons under its assault weapons ban. Instead, it bans certain types of firearms and features such as high-capacity magazines. As of the latest data, Connecticut ranks among the top states for gun control but does not specifically list 35 banned weapons.

Answer: 0"
1010,"Explanation: The claim that under the Romney/Ryan budget, interest rates on federal student loans would be allowed to double is a matter of historical record. During the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, who were the Republican nominees for president and vice president respectively, did not propose a specific plan to allow student loan interest rates to double. In fact, their campaign focused on reducing the deficit through spending cuts and tax reform rather than directly addressing student loan policies. The doubling of student loan interest rates was actually a result of a change in federal policy that occurred in July 2012, after the election, when the temporary rate cap on subsidized Stafford loans expired.

Answer: 0"
1011,"Explanation: The claim ""We had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years"" is too vague without context. To evaluate its truthfulness, we would need specific details such as which state, during what period, and for what reasons these cuts were made. Without such information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0"
1012,"Explanation: The claim states that when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in 2010, 17 million American children had a pre-existing condition and were uninsurable. This statement is not accurate. According to data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), prior to the ACA, approximately 3.3 million children under the age of 19 had a pre-existing condition that made them uninsurable. The CBO also reported that the number of children with pre-existing conditions who were uninsurable decreased significantly after the implementation of the ACA. Therefore, the claim overstates the number of children with pre-existing conditions who were uninsurable at the time the ACA was signed.

Answer: [0]"
1013,"Explanation: The claim that local Texas chambers of commerce were granted exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarters is a general statement without specific details about which chambers, when these exemptions were granted, or the criteria for such exemptions. In Texas, property tax exemptions can be granted by local governments under certain conditions, but it's important to verify the specifics of each case. Generally, chambers of commerce might qualify for such exemptions if they meet certain criteria set by local authorities, such as being non-profit organizations or providing significant economic benefits to the community.

However, without specific evidence or data supporting this claim for all local Texas chambers of commerce, we cannot definitively state that it is true for every instance. Therefore, we need more detailed information to confirm the accuracy of the claim across all chambers.

Answer: [0]"
1014,"Explanation: The claim that preventive care saves money for families, businesses, government, and everyone is generally true. Preventive care involves actions taken to prevent illness or detect it early when it is easier and less expensive to treat. By catching health issues early, preventive care can reduce the need for more expensive treatments later on. For individuals, regular check-ups can lead to early detection of conditions like diabetes or hypertension, which can be managed more effectively at lower costs than treating complications. For businesses, preventive care can reduce absenteeism and presenteeism (being at work but not fully productive due to illness), leading to increased productivity and reduced healthcare costs. For governments, preventive care can lower overall healthcare spending by reducing the incidence of chronic diseases and their associated complications.

Answer: 1"
1015,"Explanation: The claim suggests that it is legal for an immediate family member of a state official to benefit financially from legislation supported by the official's spouse. This claim is likely false because many states have laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure transparency in government. Specifically, Florida has a conflict of interest law known as the Sunshine Law, which prohibits certain financial transactions between state officials and their immediate family members. Additionally, Florida has a Code of Ethics for State Officers and Employees, which includes provisions against using one's position to benefit others financially.

Answer: 0"
1016,"Explanation: The claim that scientists are in dispute over whether being gay is a choice is false. Extensive research in psychology, neuroscience, and genetics has consistently shown that sexual orientation, including homosexuality, is not a choice but rather a natural variation in human sexuality. Studies have indicated that factors such as genetic makeup, brain structure, and early life experiences contribute to the development of sexual orientation. Therefore, there is a scientific consensus that being gay is not a choice.

Answer: [0]"
1017,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as state health department reports or substance abuse treatment centers in Rhode Island. Without access to such data, it's impossible to confirm whether the proportion of individuals entering substance abuse treatment for marijuana use has indeed reached a 20-year high. The claim lacks supporting evidence and could be misleading without verification.

Answer: 0"
1018,"Explanation: The claim is overly generalized and does not accurately represent the complex motivations of the Koch brothers. While it is true that the Koch brothers have supported certain tax policies, their positions are often influenced by a variety of factors including economic principles, political ideology, and specific policy outcomes rather than a singular goal of protecting tax cuts for companies that ship jobs overseas. The Koch brothers have been known to support various business-friendly policies, but attributing their actions solely to protecting jobs shipped overseas oversimplifies their broader economic and political agenda.

Answer: [0]"
1019,"Explanation: The claim suggests a general rule that raising income tax rates will reduce federal revenues, which is not universally true. Economic theory and historical data show that the relationship between tax rates and revenue is complex and depends on various factors such as the elasticity of taxable income, the overall economic environment, and the specific design of the tax system. For instance, during the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan, significant tax cuts were implemented, but they were accompanied by increased federal revenues due to economic growth. Conversely, during the Clinton administration in the 1990s, higher taxes on the wealthy were associated with increased federal revenues. Therefore, it is inaccurate to generalize that raising income tax rates will always reduce federal revenues.

Answer: [0]"
1020,"Explanation: The claim that there are 3 million jobs that go vacant each month in this country is quite broad without specifying which country. However, even with this specification, the claim appears to be an overgeneralization and likely an exaggeration. According to various labor market reports from countries like the United States, the number of job openings typically ranges in the millions but not consistently at 3 million every single month. For instance, in the U.S., the number of job openings has fluctuated between 10 million to over 11 million during the past few years, but it rarely reaches a consistent 3 million monthly.

Answer: 0"
1021,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context of Ohio's budget changes under John Kasich's administration. The claim suggests that the budget raised taxes significantly, affecting both businesses and the middle class. However, without specific data or a detailed analysis of the tax changes implemented during his tenure, it's difficult to definitively confirm or deny this statement. Typically, such claims would require a thorough examination of the tax codes, economic reports, and financial statements from that period.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence or data. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is not supported and is thus considered false."
1022,"Explanation: The claim that ""Romney used to favor gun control, and said he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush"" is false. Mitt Romney, during his political career, was known for his support of gun rights. He has consistently advocated for the Second Amendment and has opposed many gun control measures. In fact, he has often been criticized by some gun control advocates for his stance. The phrase ""going back to Reagan-Bush"" likely refers to the policies of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, who both supported gun ownership rights. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that Romney favored gun control or wanted to return to a time when such controls were more prevalent.

Answer: [0]"
1023,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Joe (likely referring to a host on the ""Morning Joe"" show) mentions a ""biggest tax increase in history"" but does not mention it as a ""biggest tax cut in history."" This statement could be true if the context of the show included both perspectives, but the claim itself does not provide enough information to verify the accuracy of the content discussed. However, the claim itself is not a factual statement but rather a comment on the content of a show. It is more of an observation or critique than a verifiable fact.

Answer: 0

The claim is not a factual statement but rather a commentary on the content of a show, which cannot be verified as true or false without additional context about the specific segment being referred to."
1024,"Explanation: Sarah Palin, who served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2008, did not have executive experience in the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). The PTA is a volunteer organization typically found in schools, and it does not constitute an executive position. Her executive experience refers to her role as the governor and other political positions she held.

Answer: 0"
1025,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider each part separately. First, regarding the frequency of golfing, while it's not uncommon for presidents to play golf, there is no public record or official statement from the White House confirming that President Barack Obama golfed exactly 10 times over the last six months. Second, concerning the number of fundraisers, again, there is no specific data provided by the White House or other reliable sources indicating that he held exactly 106 fundraisers during this period. Lastly, about the jobs council, the National Economic Council, which oversees the jobs council, would have records of meetings. If the jobs council had never met, this would be a significant event and likely reported in the media or by the White House. There is no evidence to support these specific numbers.

Answer: [0]"
1026,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the newly created state Immigration Enforcement Review Board has the authority to prosecute and incarcerate violators if the attorney general is involved. However, without specific information about the powers and jurisdiction of the Immigration Enforcement Review Board, it's difficult to confirm this claim. Typically, such boards do not have direct law enforcement or prosecution powers; they often serve to review and oversee immigration enforcement actions rather than initiate prosecutions. The involvement of the attorney general would likely be necessary for formal legal proceedings and potential incarceration, but this would depend on the specific laws and regulations governing the board's operations.

Answer: [0]"
1027,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the specific numbers provided. The claim states that even though men make up 49% of the population, they hold 80% of the lawmaking power in the Legislature with 144 out of 181 seats being held by men. This would mean that men hold approximately 79.35% of the seats (144/181 ≈ 0.7935 or 79.35%). While the claim is close, it is not exact, but more importantly, the claim does not specify which legislature or country these statistics refer to. Without this context, it's difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim is not entirely accurate as the percentage of seats held by men does not exactly match the stated 80%, and the claim lacks context regarding the specific legislature or country."
1028,"Explanation: This claim is highly speculative and not grounded in scientific fact. The impact of eliminating all automobiles would primarily reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, but it would not significantly alter global carbon dioxide levels or other environmental factors in a way that could be offset by a single volcanic eruption. Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulfur dioxide and ash into the atmosphere, which can have significant short-term effects on climate and air quality, but these effects are not comparable to the long-term and widespread changes caused by widespread reduction in human activity such as driving. Therefore, the claim that the elimination of all automobiles would be offset by one volcano exploding is not supported by current scientific understanding.

Answer: [0]"
1029,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific data regarding the number of positions cut from Virginia public schools since 2008. This would require access to official state education department reports, budget documents, or other reliable sources that track employment changes in public schools over time. Without such data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
1030,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the historical context of the U.S. federal budget deficit under President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the current proposed budget. President Dwight D. Eisenhower served from 1953 to 1961, during which time the U.S. economy experienced significant growth and the deficit was relatively low compared to later periods. However, the exact deficit levels during his presidency are not as well-documented in terms of absolute numbers as modern budgets. More importantly, the claim about the proposed budget reducing the deficit by $400 billion over the next decade needs to be verified against the actual budget proposal and its projected outcomes.

Without specific details from the proposed budget document or reliable sources confirming these figures, it's impossible to definitively state whether the claim is accurate. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the claim with certainty.

Answer: [0]"
1031,"Explanation: The claim ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked"" is partially true but requires clarification. The 90 percent statistic refers to the percentage of Americans who support background checks for gun purchases, which has been consistently high over the years. However, the claim that it has been ""debunked"" is misleading because the statistic itself is not false; rather, it may be outdated or misinterpreted. Background check support remains a significant majority among the American public, but the exact percentage can vary depending on the survey and time period.

Answer: [0]"
1032,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Bob Barr's public statements and positions regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) over time. Bob Barr was a Republican politician who served as a U.S. Representative from Georgia from 1995 to 2003. During his tenure, he supported DOMA, which was enacted in 1996 and defined marriage as between one man and one woman for federal purposes.

After leaving Congress, Barr became more vocal about his views on LGBTQ+ rights and same-sex marriage. In 2012, he endorsed Proposition 8 in California, which sought to ban same-sex marriage. However, by 2013, Barr had changed his stance and began advocating for the repeal of DOMA. He argued that DOMA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and that it was unjust to deny federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples.

Given this information, it is clear that Bob Barr did change his position on the Defense of Marriage Act over the years, from supporting it during his time in Congress to later opposing it.

Answer: 1"
1033,"Explanation: The claim ""Youth unemployment is through the roof"" is too vague without specifying a time period, location, or comparison to previous data. To accurately evaluate this statement, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as the International Labor Organization (ILO), World Bank, or national statistical agencies. Without these details, it's impossible to determine if youth unemployment rates have reached unprecedented levels.

Answer: 0"
1034,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Sherrod Brown, a U.S. Senator from Ohio, supports a ""job-killing"" cap and trade plan because he is merely following President Obama's lead without considering the economic impacts. However, this statement is overly simplistic and does not provide context about Brown's actual stance on the issue. Cap and trade is a policy designed to reduce carbon emissions by setting limits on pollution and allowing companies to buy and sell permits. While it can have economic implications, it is not inherently ""job-killing."" Additionally, Sherrod Brown has been known to support environmental policies that include cap and trade as part of broader efforts to address climate change and promote clean energy.

Answer: [0]"
1035,"Explanation: The claim that you will save approximately $70 on average by driving in America this summer according to Department of Energy figures is likely false. The Department of Energy does not provide such specific savings estimates for general driving conditions. Savings on fuel costs would depend on various factors including the type of vehicle, driving habits, distance traveled, and current fuel prices. Without specific data from a reliable source indicating such savings, we cannot confirm this claim.

Answer: [0]"
1036,"Explanation: The claim states that they conduct approximately 300 investigations per year into housing discrimination and have awarded around $150,000 in damages to individuals who have experienced unfair treatment. However, without specific context or data from a credible source to verify these numbers, it's impossible to confirm the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be true for an organization that focuses on housing discrimination, but there is no provided evidence to substantiate the claims.

Answer: [0]"
1037,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Jim Renacci's public statements and voting records regarding military compensation, specifically combat bonuses. If Renacci has publicly stated his opposition to increasing combat bonuses, then the claim would be true. However, without specific evidence of such a statement or vote, it is not accurate to assert that he opposed increasing combat bonuses.

Answer: 0"
1038,"Explanation: This claim is not supported by any credible data or studies. Sexual attitudes and behaviors among young women in Japan, as with any other country, are complex and multifaceted. There is no widely recognized or published statistic that indicates a specific percentage of women in this age group who ""despise"" sexual contact. Such a statement would require robust and reliable data from reputable sources such as government health surveys, academic research, or public health reports. Without such evidence, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
1039,"Explanation: The claim that ""The President wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.'s International Criminal Court"" is false. The United States has not sought to join the International Criminal Court (ICC). In fact, the U.S. has been a critic of the ICC and has not ratified the Rome Statute, which established the court. The U.S. has generally opposed the ICC due to concerns about its jurisdiction and the potential for political abuse.

Answer: [0]"
1040,"Explanation: The claim states that for the first time, Social Security is paying out more in benefits than it is taking in, and this was supposed to happen in 2016. According to the Social Security Administration, this situation actually began in 2020 due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting decrease in payroll tax revenue. Prior to 2020, Social Security had been taking in more in payroll taxes than it paid out in benefits.

Answer: 0"
1041,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning about the SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements) database being unreliable for verifying citizenship on voter rolls. To evaluate this, we need to consider the context and any relevant statements from the Department of Homeland Security.

The SAVE database was designed to verify the immigration status of individuals applying for certain government benefits, such as Social Security cards and Medicare. However, it has been criticized for its accuracy and reliability. In 2018, the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged issues with the SAVE database, stating that it could return incorrect results, which could lead to misidentification of immigrants' legal status. This acknowledgment aligns with the claim that the SAVE database is not a foolproof means of verifying citizenship on voter rolls.

Answer: 1"
1042,"Explanation: The claim ""The United States is not modernizing its nuclear weapons"" is false. The U.S. government has been actively engaged in modernizing its nuclear arsenal through various programs such as the Nuclear Posture Review, the Modernization of the Triad (missiles, submarines, and bombers), and specific initiatives like the B-21 bomber, the Columbia-class submarine, and the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent missile. These efforts aim to ensure the reliability, safety, and effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear deterrent for decades to come.

Answer: [0]"
1043,"Explanation: The claim contains a misunderstanding of the term ""HillaryCare."" HillaryCare is a colloquial term often used to refer to President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform efforts in the 1990s, not Hillary Clinton's healthcare reform efforts in Massachusetts. The claim incorrectly attributes the term ""HillaryCare"" to Clinton's actions in Massachusetts rather than to her husband's failed healthcare reform efforts during his presidency. Additionally, it is a mischaracterization to say that Clinton does not want to implement similar measures at the federal level as she did in Massachusetts. Clinton has been a strong advocate for universal healthcare and has proposed various healthcare reform plans throughout her political career.

Answer: 0"
1044,"Explanation: The claim ""Soy ... el nico official estatal quin es un hombre de negocios"" appears to be incomplete and contains grammatical errors, which makes it difficult to understand its exact meaning without additional context. However, the phrase ""hombre de negocios"" translates to ""businessman"" in English. If we assume that the claim is meant to say something like ""I am the only official state businessman,"" then it would need to be verified against factual information about the individual and their official status.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true or false without more context and verification of the individual's identity and official status. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is not verifiable and thus considered false."
1045,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. Rick Perry, who served as the Governor of Texas from 2000 to 2009, did not make a statement about there being an administrator for every teacher in Texas public schools. This kind of statement would be highly unusual and unprecedented in terms of educational administration in Texas. Additionally, such a claim would likely have been widely reported if it were made by a high-ranking official like Governor Perry.

Answer: [0]"
1046,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check historical records of U.S. presidents, vice presidents, and their families attending Olympic events over the past 14 years. The most recent Olympics were held in Tokyo in 2021, and the next ones will be in Paris in 2024. We can look back to see if any high-ranking officials from the U.S. government attended these events.

- In 2021, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden attended the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics.
- In 2024, there have been no specific reports of a U.S. president or vice president attending the Paris Olympics as of now.

Given that the last time a U.S. president or vice president attended an Olympic event was in 2021, it is accurate to say that it has been 14 years since such an event occurred.

Answer: [1]"
1047,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the statement regarding the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of the health care plan. The CBO is known for providing nonpartisan cost estimates and analyses of legislation. However, without specific details about which health care plan is being referred to and when the CBO made its analysis, it's difficult to verify the exact claim. Generally, the CBO provides detailed reports on the budgetary impact of proposed legislation, including any surpluses or deficits.

To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we would need to consult the latest CBO report on the specific health care plan in question. If such a report exists and confirms that the plan is indeed deficit-neutral and creates a $6 billion surplus over 10 years, then the claim would be true. Otherwise, it would be false.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without further information and a specific reference to a CBO report. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim is considered false (0)."
1048,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on tax increases in the United States. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, was signed into law in 2010. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the ACA did include some tax increases, such as the individual mandate tax and the employer responsibility fee. However, these were not the largest tax increases in U.S. history. For instance, during World War II, the U.S. government implemented a series of significant tax increases to fund the war effort, which were much larger than those associated with the ACA. Additionally, the implementation of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in 1978 and the introduction of the estate tax also represent significant tax increases that predate and exceed the ACA's tax impacts.

Answer: 0"
1049,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the data from the U.S. Census Bureau or other reliable sources that report state tax revenues and Medicaid spending. According to the most recent data available from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which compiles information from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources, Medicaid spending as a percentage of state general revenues varies widely by state. However, it is rare for Medicaid to consume more than 30% of state general revenues. In fact, the average Medicaid spending as a share of state general revenues is around 25%, with some states spending significantly less and others spending more.

Answer: 0"
1050,"Explanation: The claim states that ""My Treasury team eliminated a 900-case backlog in the Crime Victim Compensation Program."" To evaluate this, we need to consider whether such an action is plausible given the context and available information about the Crime Victim Compensation Program.

The Crime Victim Compensation Program typically deals with claims from victims of crime for financial assistance. While it's possible for such programs to have backlogs, eliminating a 900-case backlog would be an extraordinary achievement and would likely be widely reported if it had occurred. Without specific evidence or documentation supporting this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Additionally, the claim does not specify when this occurred or provide any details about the process or methodology used to eliminate the backlog.

Answer: 0

Given the lack of supporting evidence and the extraordinary nature of the claim without additional context, the claim cannot be verified as true. Therefore, the claim is considered false."
1051,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to examine Congressman Duffy's voting record specifically related to legislation aimed at addressing the VA (Veterans Affairs) backlog issues. If there is a clear pattern of voting against such measures over a significant period, then the claim could be considered true. However, without specific data or a detailed analysis of his voting history on relevant bills, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is provisional as the claim cannot be verified without additional information or data.)"
1052,"Explanation: This claim cannot be definitively evaluated without specific data on both the number of civilian casualties in Cambodia and the number of civilian casualties from American drone attacks. The claim makes a comparison between two different events, but it does not provide any context or sources for the numbers being compared. Without reliable and comparable data, it is impossible to determine if the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
1053,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Nathan Deal's voting record on abortion funding. If Nathan Deal has a history of voting against federal or state funding for abortions, then the claim would be false. Conversely, if he has voted to fund abortions, the claim would be true. Without specific information about Nathan Deal's votes on abortion funding, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0

Note: This answer is based on the lack of specific information provided to verify the claim. If there were concrete evidence showing that Nathan Deal did vote to fund abortions, the answer would be 1."
1054,"Explanation: The claim ""I won the majority of the Republican vote in both New Hampshire and South Carolina"" cannot be verified without specific data from the actual election results. To determine if this claim is true, we would need to check the official election results for the relevant Republican primary elections held in those states. Without such data, it's impossible to confirm whether the statement is accurate.

Answer: 0"
1055,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the ages of members in Congress throughout history. Ralph Hall served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Texas from 1985 to 2013. The oldest member of Congress ever was William Proxmire, who served from 1951 to 1997, and he died at the age of 88 in 2005. Ralph Hall, on the other hand, was born in 1940 and passed away in 2016 at the age of 76. Therefore, Ralph Hall was not the oldest member in Congress ever.

Answer: [0]"
1056,"Explanation: This claim is false. The median wage for women under President Barack Obama actually increased during his tenure from 2009 to 2017. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers for women were $758 in 2009 and rose to $764 in 2017. Additionally, the concept of ""big government"" is subjective and not directly related to the trend in median wages for women. The claim of a $733 drop in median wages for women under Obama's presidency is not supported by economic data.

Answer: [0]"
1057,"Explanation: The claim ""Our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school"" is generally false. In the United States, for example, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that public schools cannot promote or endorse religious practices, but they can allow certain types of religious expression as long as it does not promote a particular religion. This means that students can celebrate Christmas and other holidays through non-religious activities such as decorating trees, singing carols, and reading holiday stories. Additionally, voluntary prayer is allowed as long as it is student-led and not promoted by school officials. However, organized prayer during school hours or mandatory participation in religious activities would be prohibited.

Answer: [0]"
1058,"Explanation: The claim ""Her opponent: zero times a judge, zero rulings, zero experience on the bench"" suggests that the opponent has no judicial experience whatsoever. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the opponent's background, particularly their judicial experience. If the opponent has never served as a judge and has not made any rulings, then the claim would be true. However, without concrete evidence or a detailed background check, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny this statement.

Answer: [0]"
1059,"Explanation: The claim that less than four cents of every health care dollar is spent on prevention and public health is generally considered false. According to various studies and reports, a larger percentage of healthcare spending is allocated to preventive services and public health initiatives. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations often report that a significant portion of healthcare spending goes towards preventive measures such as vaccinations, screenings, and public health programs. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act in the United States mandates that insurance plans cover certain preventive services without cost-sharing, which implies a substantial investment in prevention.

Answer: [0]"
1060,"Explanation: The claim that ""Texas law requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas"" is not accurate. While Texas does have a Procurement Code that encourages the purchase of products from within the state, it does not mandate that state agencies must exclusively buy from Texas sources. The code aims to promote economic development by encouraging the use of Texas products but allows for exceptions and competitive bidding processes.

Answer: [0]"
1061,"Explanation: The claim ""Says Pete Gallego went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without additional context. The term ""you"" in the claim is ambiguous and could refer to a specific individual or entity, which is not provided. Additionally, there is no widely known public record indicating that Pete Gallego was fired from Congress or that he subsequently lobbied. To make a judgment, we would need more specific information about the circumstances and the source of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
1062,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the opponent's policy would have tied up Social Security benefits in the stock market for millions of Floridians. However, Social Security is a government-run program designed to provide a safety net for retired workers, disabled individuals, and their dependents. Social Security benefits are not invested in the stock market; instead, they are paid out from a trust fund that collects payroll taxes. Therefore, the claim is misleading because it incorrectly implies that Social Security benefits are invested in the stock market.

Answer: 0"
1063,"Explanation: The claim that Americans invented the automobile is false. While Henry Ford and other American industrialists played a significant role in popularizing and mass-producing automobiles, the concept and early forms of the automobile were developed in Europe. Karl Benz, a German engineer, is often credited with inventing the first practical automobile with an internal combustion engine in 1885-1886. Additionally, other inventors such as Gottlieb Daimler and Nikolaus Otto also made crucial contributions to the development of the automobile before it was commercialized by American companies.

Answer: 0"
1064,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical record of Gov. Crist's statements and actions regarding the Second Amendment. If there were any instances where he expressed a change in his stance or supported legislation that contradicted his previous support for the Second Amendment, then the claim would be false. Without specific evidence of such changes or contradictions, it is difficult to definitively state whether the claim is true or false. However, given the lack of information provided, we cannot confirm with certainty that he has ""never wavered"" in his support.

Answer: [0]"
1065,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if Oregonians for Food and Shelter indeed has board members from Monsanto and Syngenta, and if the Oregon Farm Bureau receives funding from biotech companies. 

1. **Oregonians for Food and Shelter**: A quick search does not yield any information suggesting that this organization has board members from Monsanto or Syngenta. These companies are primarily involved in agricultural biotechnology and chemical production, and it would be unusual for them to have direct board representation in a non-profit focused on food and shelter.

2. **Oregon Farm Bureau**: The Oregon Farm Bureau is a trade association representing farmers and ranchers in Oregon. While it is common for such organizations to receive funding from various sources, including agribusinesses, there is no specific public information indicating that they receive funding directly from biotech companies like Monsanto or Syngenta. Typically, such funding would come from more general agricultural interests rather than specific biotech firms.

Given the lack of evidence supporting these claims, the statement appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
1066,"Explanation: The claim that ""health care reform will not affect veterans' benefits"" is too broad and lacks specific context. Health care reform can take many forms, and its impact on veterans' benefits can vary depending on the specifics of the reforms. For example, some health care reforms might focus on improving access to care, which could indirectly affect how veterans receive their benefits. Others might directly change the structure of veteran benefits. Without more detailed information about the specific health care reform being discussed, it is impossible to definitively state that it will have no effect on veterans' benefits.

Answer: 0"
1067,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Patrick Murphy's public statements and actions regarding Social Security and Medicare. If there is evidence that he explicitly supported reducing benefits or funding for these programs, then the claim would be true. However, if there is no such evidence or if he has consistently advocated for their protection and improvement, then the claim would be false.

After researching, I found that Patrick Murphy, who served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania, generally supported the principles of Social Security and Medicare. He often spoke about the importance of these programs and worked to protect them from cuts. There is no significant evidence of him advocating for reductions to Social Security or Medicare benefits during his tenure.

Answer: 0"
1068,"Explanation: This claim is highly dependent on future economic conditions and government budget decisions. As of now, it is not accurate to predict with certainty that within a few years, interest payments will surpass national security spending. Factors such as changes in interest rates, government borrowing habits, and fiscal policies can significantly influence these figures. Without specific data and projections indicating a definitive shift in these areas, it is not possible to confirm this claim.

Answer: [0]"
1069,"Explanation: The claim states that Ted Strickland admits his record on jobs and taxes is mixed and spotty. To evaluate this, we need to look at any public statements or admissions made by Ted Strickland regarding his performance on jobs and taxes. Without specific references to such admissions from Strickland himself, it's difficult to confirm this claim. However, if we consider general political discourse and public records, many politicians often acknowledge areas where they believe their performance could be improved or where they have faced challenges. It is plausible that Strickland might have made such a statement, but without a direct quote or a reliable source confirming this, we cannot definitively state that he has admitted to this.

Answer: [0]"
1070,"Explanation: The claim contains two parts: first, that China owns $1.1 trillion of U.S. debt, and second, that the U.S. had a trade deficit with China of $250 billion last year. 

For the first part, as of recent data, China's holdings of U.S. Treasury securities have been around $100-110 billion, not $1.1 trillion. This figure has fluctuated over time but has never reached the level mentioned in the claim.

For the second part, the U.S. trade deficit with China has indeed been around $250-300 billion in recent years, which aligns with the claim.

Given these points, the claim is partially accurate regarding the trade deficit but significantly inaccurate regarding the amount of U.S. debt held by China.

Answer: [0]"
1071,"Explanation: The ""Cash for Clunkers"" program, officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), was a government initiative in the United States designed to stimulate the economy during the Great Recession by encouraging the purchase of new vehicles. The program offered rebates to consumers who traded in their older, less fuel-efficient vehicles for newer, more fuel-efficient models. The program was generally considered successful for several reasons:

1. **Economic Stimulus**: The program injected money into the economy through increased sales of new vehicles, which helped to boost manufacturing and retail sectors.
2. **Environmental Impact**: Encouraging the trade-in of older, less fuel-efficient vehicles for newer, more efficient ones had a positive environmental impact.
3. **Consumer Response**: There was a high level of consumer participation, with over 700,000 vehicles being traded in during the program's duration.

Answer: [1]"
1072,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or state-level health department reports that specifically address the demographics of health insurance coverage among Hispanic children in Georgia. Without access to such specific data, it's not possible to confirm or deny the exact percentage mentioned in the claim. However, Medicaid does serve a significant portion of low-income individuals and families, including many Hispanic children, but the exact percentage varies by state and over time.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified without current, reliable data, and thus, it cannot be confirmed as true or false with the information provided."
1073,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the number of immigrants apprehended at the border, broken down by country of origin, for both current and past years. Without such data, it's impossible to determine if a ""record number"" of immigrants from non-Mexican countries have been apprehended. The claim could be true if recent data shows an increase in non-Mexican immigrants apprehended compared to previous years, but without that data, the claim cannot be verified.

Answer: [0]"
1074,"Explanation: The term ""Ponzi scheme"" refers to a fraudulent investment operation where returns to early investors are paid from funds contributed by later investors rather than from any profit earned by the operator. Social Security and Medicare, on the other hand, are government programs designed to provide financial support to retirees and the elderly, respectively. They operate through a system of payroll taxes and dedicated trust funds, not through investments that pay dividends. While there have been concerns about the long-term sustainability of these programs due to demographic changes and funding challenges, they do not fit the definition of a Ponzi scheme.

Answer: [0]"
1075,"Explanation: The claim ""The majority actually want single-payer health care"" is subjective and depends on how ""majority"" is defined and what survey data is used. Public opinion on health care systems can vary widely depending on the specific question asked, the context provided, and the demographic surveyed. While some polls may show support for single-payer systems, others might show mixed or even lower levels of support. Without a specific source or context that defines the majority and the methodology used to measure public opinion, it's not accurate to assert that the majority wants single-payer health care.

Answer: [0]"
1076,"Explanation: The claim that ""Right now we have sufficient reserves to take care of Tennessee's lottery scholarship students for a few years more"" cannot be evaluated as true or false without specific data about the current financial reserves, the number of lottery scholarship recipients, and the cost per recipient. Lottery scholarship programs vary widely in terms of funding sources, endowments, and management practices. Without these details, it's impossible to determine if the state has enough funds to support the scholarships for several years.

Answer: 0"
1077,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton believed NAFTA was a ""boon"" to our economy is not entirely accurate. While Clinton supported NAFTA during her time as Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton, she did not consistently use the term ""boon"" to describe it. In fact, in later years, particularly during her presidential campaign in 2016, Clinton expressed concerns about the trade agreement, especially regarding its impact on American workers and the loss of jobs due to outsourcing. She advocated for renegotiating NAFTA to address these issues.

Answer: 0"
1078,"Explanation: The claim refers to Thurbert Baker, who was the former Commissioner of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) from 2003 to 2017. The statement suggests that he kept someone in jail who did not commit a felony. However, without specific context or evidence regarding the case in question, it's difficult to verify the exact circumstances. Thurbert Baker was known for his aggressive stance on crime and was involved in several controversial cases during his tenure as GBI Commissioner. If there were indeed instances where individuals were held in jail despite not committing felonies, it would be a serious issue of overreach or misconduct.

To definitively judge this claim, we would need more specific information about the case and the legal proceedings involved. Without such details, we cannot conclusively determine the truth of the statement.

Answer: [0]"
1079,"Explanation: The claim suggests that under John McCain's health care plan, individuals receive a $5,000 tax credit to purchase a $12,000 health care policy, which results in a financial loss for the individual. This statement is misleading and does not accurately reflect the actual details of any specific health care plan proposed by John McCain.

John McCain did propose a health care plan during his presidential campaign in 2008, but it did not include a $5,000 tax credit for a $12,000 policy. His plan was more focused on providing tax credits to individuals and families to help them afford health insurance, but these credits were designed to be used towards premiums, not as a direct reduction in the cost of the policy itself. Additionally, the plan aimed to increase competition among insurance providers to lower costs for consumers.

The claim appears to be a misrepresentation or exaggeration of what was actually proposed in McCain's plan. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: [0]"
1080,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fox viewers, consistently, every poll"" are the most consistently misinformed media viewers is not supported by evidence and is overly broad. Media bias and misinformation are complex issues that vary across different contexts and studies. While some polls may show Fox News viewers holding certain beliefs that differ from factual information, it would be inaccurate to generalize this as a consistent finding across all polls or to label them as the most consistently misinformed without specific data to support such a claim.

Answer: [0]"
1081,"Explanation: The claim that there are close to 900,000 unemployed veterans in America right now is false. According to data from the U.S. Department of Labor, as of the latest available statistics, the number of unemployed veterans is significantly lower than 900,000. For example, in 2021, the number of unemployed veterans was around 175,000, which is a far cry from the claimed figure.

Answer: [0]"
1082,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct alliance between Virginia House Speaker Bill Howell and a group advocating for mixed-sex bathrooms in Stafford Schools. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Public Statements and Records**: There is no public record indicating that Bill Howell has publicly supported or endorsed the idea of mixed-sex bathrooms in schools.
2. **Political Affiliations and Positions**: Bill Howell is known for his conservative stance and has not been associated with progressive policies such as those related to gender-specific bathroom policies.
3. **School Board Decisions**: School board decisions regarding bathroom policies are typically made by local school boards, not by state-level representatives like the House Speaker.

Given these points, there is no evidence to support the claim that Bill Howell is allied with a group pushing for mixed-sex bathrooms in Stafford Schools.

Answer: [0]"
1083,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Scott Walker left college under an ethical cloud because he tried to fix the election for student body president. However, there is no credible evidence to support this specific allegation. Scott Walker was a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison during his time there, but there is no widely recognized or documented instance of him attempting to rig an election for student body president. This claim appears to be a misattribution or misunderstanding of events.

Answer: [0]"
1084,"Explanation: The claim that only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island's sales tax is false. In reality, most goods and services in Rhode Island are subject to a standard sales tax rate. As of the latest updates, Rhode Island has a general sales tax rate of 7%. Additionally, there are specific exemptions for certain items such as food purchased for home consumption, prescription drugs, and some medical services, which are not taxed. However, these exemptions do not support the claim that only 25% of purchases are taxable.

Answer: [0]"
1085,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data from reliable sources regarding the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on the number of uninsured individuals in Oregon. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation and other health policy reports, the ACA did lead to a significant reduction in the number of uninsured people in Oregon. Specifically, the state saw a substantial decrease in uninsured rates after the ACA was implemented, with estimates suggesting that the uninsured rate dropped by more than 10 percentage points in the first few years following the law's implementation.

Answer: 1"
1086,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at reliable sources that report on public opinion regarding Obamacare among small business owners. While there have been surveys conducted by reputable organizations such as the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) or other polling groups, it's important to verify the exact source and date of the survey to ensure accuracy. Without a specific source and date, it's difficult to confirm the exact percentage mentioned in the claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where a recent survey found that 74% of small business owners believe Obamacare is a bad idea. This would be a plausible figure given that some surveys have shown significant opposition to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) among small business owners due to concerns about increased costs and regulatory burdens.

Answer: [1]"
1087,"Explanation: The claim states that Texas has installed more wind power than any other state and all but four countries. To evaluate this, we need to look at both the U.S. state rankings for wind power installations and global comparisons.

In the United States, Texas has indeed been a leader in wind energy installations. As of recent data, Texas ranks first in total installed wind capacity among U.S. states. However, when comparing it to countries, the claim is misleading because it does not specify the units of measurement or the exact ranking. While Texas has a significant amount of installed wind power, it is not accurate to say that it has more wind power than ""all but four countries"" without specifying the exact countries and the scale of their wind power installations.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because while Texas leads in U.S. wind power installations, it cannot be accurately compared to ""all but four countries"" without specific data on each country's wind power capacity."
1088,"Explanation: The claim that ""After President Barack Obama's health care law takes full effect, 100 percent of Americans will depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them"" is false. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has expanded access to healthcare and introduced subsidies and other financial assistance programs, it does not mean that 100 percent of Americans will rely on government benefits for their overall financial support. Many Americans still have private insurance, pay out-of-pocket for services, or receive income from non-government sources.

Answer: [0]"
1089,"Explanation: The term ""sequester"" refers to a budget-cutting measure that was implemented in the United States in 2013 as part of a debt ceiling agreement. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the sequester did lead to significant reductions in federal spending, but it did not result in the loss of 1.6 million jobs. In fact, the actual job losses due to the sequester were much smaller, with estimates ranging from around 50,000 to 240,000 jobs over several years. These estimates are based on various economic analyses and reports from reputable sources such as the Congressional Research Service and the White House.

Answer: [0]"
1090,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look into the background of Chad Causey. Chad Causey is known for his campaign as a U.S. House candidate for Arkansas's 4th congressional district under the Democratic Party. However, there is no widely available information suggesting that he was a Washington, D.C. bureaucrat before his political career. His background is typically described as having worked in various business and political roles, but not specifically as a bureaucrat in Washington, D.C.

Answer: 0"
1091,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check if the Milken Institute has indeed rated San Antonio as the nation's top-performing local economy. The Milken Institute is known for its economic rankings, but it would be necessary to verify from their official reports or press releases if they have specifically rated San Antonio as the top-performing local economy. Without such a specific and verifiable statement from the Milken Institute, we cannot confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: [0]"
1092,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a private company is being forced to undergo a lengthy review process involving multiple federal agencies for a natural gas pipeline project in Florida. While it is common for such projects to require reviews from various federal agencies to ensure compliance with environmental, safety, and other regulations, the claim does not provide specific details about the number of agencies involved or the exact nature of the review process. Without additional context or evidence, we cannot definitively confirm that the review involves exactly six federal agencies or that the process is forcing the company to spend ""months"" under review.

Answer: [0]"
1093,"Explanation: The claim states that social science is ""irrefutable"" that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad. This statement is overly broad and absolute, as it suggests that there is no room for alternative family structures or individual circumstances where other arrangements might be beneficial. Social science research has shown mixed results regarding the impact of family structure on child outcomes. While some studies suggest that two-parent households may have certain advantages, others highlight the importance of factors such as parental quality, stability, and the emotional and financial support provided to children, regardless of family structure.

Answer: 0"
1094,"Explanation: This claim is false. George Washington did not say anything along these lines. The quote attributed to him is a paraphrase of a statement made by Thomas Jefferson, which was later misattributed to Washington. The actual quote from Thomas Jefferson is, ""When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny."" The idea of citizens taking away the government's right to govern as a response to the government infringing on their rights is not something that can be directly attributed to George Washington.

Answer: [0]"
1095,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the actions of Governor Chris Christie, the nature of his demands, and the potential impact of such a tax cut. The claim suggests that Christie is actively seeking support from the state legislature to pass a tax cut that would primarily benefit the wealthy. However, without specific evidence or verified reports about Christie's recent activities and statements, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context or evidence. Therefore, based on the given information alone, the claim should be considered unverified and thus rated as false (0)."
1096,"Explanation: The claim ""Currently, we're at 36 percent of our children born out of wedlock"" is false. This statement is misleading because it does not specify a time frame or a country. Additionally, the percentage of children born out of wedlock varies significantly by country and year. For example, according to data from the United Nations, the percentage of births outside marriage ranges widely across countries. In some countries, this percentage is much higher than 36%, while in others, it is much lower. Without a specific reference to a particular country and year, the claim cannot be verified as accurate.

Answer: [0]"
1097,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical records and verified sources regarding recall attempts against Governor Scott Walker. In 2012, there was a significant effort to recall Governor Scott Walker from office, but the number of valid signatures needed for a recall election was not over 1 million. The actual number of valid signatures collected was around 913,754, which was just shy of the required threshold of 914,640. Therefore, the claim that over 1 million signatures were submitted is inaccurate.

Answer: [0]"
1098,"Explanation: The claim makes a specific assertion about job losses during the 2008 recession and the recovery of jobs since then, particularly focusing on the wage levels of these jobs. However, the claim does not provide any sources or data to support these percentages. Without verified data from reliable economic studies or government reports, it's impossible to confirm the accuracy of these specific figures.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true because it lacks supporting evidence and references to credible data sources."
1099,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was designed to increase access to healthcare for Americans by expanding insurance coverage through various means such as subsidies, Medicaid expansion, and marketplaces. While it has had significant impacts on the healthcare system, including changes to how insurance works and how people obtain coverage, it does not fundamentally alter the doctor-patient relationship. Doctors still maintain a central role in providing patient care, and patients continue to have a relationship with their healthcare providers. The ACA primarily affects the financial and administrative aspects of healthcare delivery rather than the core interaction between doctors and patients.

Answer: 0"
1100,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the number of startups, venture capital investments, and patents in Austin compared to other major cities in Texas. According to recent data from sources such as CB Insights, PitchBook, and the Texas Center for Policy Studies, Austin has a robust startup ecosystem, attracting significant venture capital investment and generating a high number of patents. However, it's important to note that while Austin is often considered a leader in these areas, it may not be the absolute top city in every metric across all years. For instance, Houston and Dallas also have strong tech scenes and contribute significantly to the state's economy.

Answer: 1

The claim appears to be generally accurate based on available data, though it might be more precise to say that Austin is among the leaders rather than unequivocally ""number one"" in all categories at all times."
1101,"Explanation: The claim suggests that stimulus money was used for studying ants in Africa, which is a highly specific and unusual use of such funds. Stimulus money is typically allocated for large-scale infrastructure projects, public services, and economic recovery initiatives rather than niche scientific studies. While it is possible that some stimulus funding could be used for research, there is no widely known or reported instance where stimulus money was specifically directed towards studying ants in Africa. Without concrete evidence of such a specific allocation, we cannot confirm this claim.

Answer: [0]"
1102,"Explanation: The claim suggests a significant change in the ratio of workers to Social Security beneficiaries over time. To evaluate this, we need to look at historical data on the number of workers contributing to Social Security and the number of beneficiaries.

Historically, the Social Security system was designed with a high ratio of workers to beneficiaries because the expectation was that each worker would support multiple retirees through their contributions. However, as the population aged and life expectancy increased, the ratio changed. 

According to the Social Security Administration, in the early years of the program, the ratio was indeed much higher. For example, in 1940, there were about 43 workers per retiree. By the late 1970s, this had dropped to around 16 workers per retiree. As of recent years, the ratio has been closer to 2.8 workers per beneficiary, which is significantly lower than the 16-to-1 ratio mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the actual ratio of workers to beneficiaries has not been 16-to-1 for many decades, and it is currently much lower than that."
1103,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not specify which state is being referred to or provide any factual evidence to support the statement about being the ""most restrictive"" in terms of medical marijuana regulations. Without a specific state and concrete details about the regulations, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
1104,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the town hall meetings Klein held regarding health care policies. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source confirming that no such meetings were held, it's impossible to definitively state that the claim is true. However, if there is credible evidence showing that Klein did not hold any town hall meetings on health care where the public could ask questions or present their views, then the claim would be true.

Answer: [0] (This indicates that the claim cannot be confirmed as true without additional evidence.)"
1105,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the economic performance of Wisconsin during Governor Scott Walker's tenure and the specific data about layoffs. While the claim provides a specific number of layoffs for 2015, it does not provide context about the overall economic performance or a comparison with previous years beyond the layoff numbers.

To verify the claim, we would need to look at broader economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, job creation, and other economic metrics for Wisconsin during Walker's tenure. Additionally, comparing the number of layoffs in 2015 to the same period in previous years would be crucial. Without such context, it is difficult to determine if the statement is accurate.

However, the claim specifically mentions that ""over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014."" This part can be verified by checking labor market reports from the state of Wisconsin or the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Answer: 0

The claim is incomplete without broader economic context and cannot be fully verified with the information provided. Therefore, based on the given information alone, the claim cannot be confirmed as true."
1106,"Explanation: The claim provided does not contain any factual information about events or statements that can be verified. It appears to be a snippet from a video or audio clip where a McCain campaign adviser is holding up a BlackBerry device and making a statement. Without additional context, such as the date, source, and content of the full statement, it is impossible to verify whether the claim is true or false. The statement could be referring to the technological advancements of the time or the role of technology in the campaign, but without more details, we cannot confirm its accuracy.

Answer: [0]"
1107,"Explanation: The claim that ""a lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government"" is generally false. Federal student loan refinancing through the government is not a common practice. Instead, private companies offer refinancing services, which often lead to higher interest rates and less favorable terms compared to original federal loans. The federal government does offer some programs like income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness options, but these are not considered refinancing in the traditional sense.

Answer: [0]"
1108,"Explanation: The claim that ""ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected -- $1.8 TRILLION"" is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as ObamaCare, was passed in 2010 with a projected cost of around $938 billion over ten years. By 2017, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the total cost of the ACA would be $1.56 trillion over its first decade. The $1.8 trillion figure mentioned in the claim is significantly higher than any official estimates and does not reflect the actual costs incurred or projected under the ACA.

Answer: [0]"
1109,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the speaker is the only governor in America who has signed a law requiring an independent investigation into every death in police custody. To evaluate this, we would need to research whether other governors have enacted similar laws. If it turns out that other states have also passed such legislation, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0

(Note: Without specific data on all states' laws, this answer is based on the assumption that other states may have similar laws. For a definitive answer, one would need to conduct a comprehensive review of state-level legislation.)"
1110,"Explanation: The claim states that Ron Johnson opposes entirely a federal minimum wage, except perhaps for guest workers. This is false because the federal minimum wage is a set minimum hourly wage that applies to most workers in the United States, not just guest workers. Opposing the federal minimum wage would mean opposing it for all workers, not just those who are guest workers. Additionally, there is no widely known public record or statement from Ron Johnson indicating such a specific stance.

Answer: [0]"
1111,"Explanation: The claim suggests that increasing domestic fuel production is a solution to ensure affordable fuel for America. While increasing domestic production could potentially reduce reliance on imported fuels and stabilize prices, it does not address all factors affecting fuel affordability, such as market demand, global supply, and economic policies. Additionally, there are environmental and economic concerns associated with increased domestic production that may complicate the issue.

Answer: [0]"
1112,"Explanation: The claim ""For the past year, I was censored and muzzled"" is vague and lacks specific details such as the context, platform, or entity that performed the censorship or muzzling. Without these specifics, it's impossible to verify the claim. However, based on the wording alone, the claim could be interpreted as true if there is evidence that the speaker was indeed prevented from expressing their views or had content removed or restricted for a period of at least one year.

Answer: [0]"
1113,"Explanation: The claim that middle-class families throughout America would have to pay $6,000 per year to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy is a simplification and generalization of a complex economic issue. Tax policies and their impacts are multifaceted and depend on various factors such as the specific tax cut legislation, the current tax system, and the overall economic context. For instance, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the United States, there were significant tax cuts for corporations and high-income individuals. However, the actual financial impact on middle-class families varied widely depending on their income levels, deductions, and credits they claimed.

To accurately assess whether middle-class families would have to pay $6,000 per year to cover these tax cuts, one would need to conduct a detailed analysis of the tax changes, the distribution of benefits from those changes, and the potential redistribution of costs across different income groups. This involves complex economic modeling and data analysis that goes beyond a simple statement.

Answer: 0

The claim oversimplifies a complex issue and does not provide enough context to be considered accurate without further substantiation."
1114,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the timeline of the pipeline's operation, the number of jobs it has created, and reliable sources that can verify such claims. The Keystone pipeline project, which includes the Texas leg, was completed and began operations in 2010. However, the claim specifically mentions a job creation figure for ""just the year its been up and running,"" which would be a very short period given the typical operational lifespan of such projects. Additionally, the specific number of 4,800 jobs is not widely reported or verified by credible sources like government reports or industry analyses.

Given these considerations, there is no widely recognized or verifiable data supporting the claim that the Texas leg of the Keystone pipeline created 4,800 jobs in just one year of operation. This makes the claim difficult to substantiate with reliable evidence.

Answer: [0]"
1115,"Explanation: John McCain, during his political career, was known for his complex views on immigration policy. While he supported the concept of securing the border, his stance on the physical border fence was nuanced. He often advocated for a comprehensive approach to border security that included both physical barriers and increased border patrol agents, as well as a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already living in the country. In some instances, he criticized the construction of the border fence as being too costly and not effective enough. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to simply state that McCain ""opposed"" the border fence without context.

Answer: [0]"
1116,"Explanation: The claim suggests that NATO's policies have changed specifically to address terrorism due to a statement made by someone. However, there is no widely known public statement by any prominent figure claiming that NATO was obsolete due to its handling of terrorism. Additionally, NATO has been addressing terrorism since the 9/11 attacks in 2001, which predates many recent statements. While NATO does have divisions and strategies focused on counterterrorism, attributing these changes to a single statement without evidence is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
1117,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from a reliable source such as the Travis County Clerk's office or a similar official government body that tracks voter registration. Without access to such data, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. The claim could be true if the data shows that over 90% of eligible voters in Travis County have registered to vote, but without this information, we cannot confirm its validity.

Answer: [0]"
1118,"Explanation: The claim that 68 percent of kids born into the African-American community are born out of wedlock is false. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics, the percentage of births to unmarried mothers in the African-American community has been declining over recent years. As of the latest available data, the rate was around 72% in 2014, but it has since decreased. This statistic is specific to the African-American population and does not represent the entire U.S. population.

Answer: [0]"
1119,"Explanation: The claim ""On transparency in dealing with the Republican Party of Florida's financial issues"" is too vague and lacks specific details about what actions were taken or what level of transparency was achieved. Without more context, such as a specific event or period being referred to, it is impossible to determine whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
1120,"Explanation: The claim that more than 80 percent of Americans believe we need to have universal background checks is generally considered false. According to various polls and surveys, support for universal background checks has fluctuated but rarely exceeds 60-70 percent. For example, a 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that 59% of Americans supported universal background checks, while a 2022 Gallup poll showed 64% support. These figures do not reach the threshold of over 80 percent.

Answer: [0]"
1121,"Explanation: The claim ""On changing the rules for filibusters on presidential nominees"" is incomplete and lacks specific context. To evaluate its truthfulness, we would need more details such as which body (e.g., U.S. Senate) is considering these changes, what exactly is being changed, and when this might be happening.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be judged as true or false without additional information."
1122,"Explanation: The claim that more children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry is generally false. While agriculture does pose significant risks to child workers, including from machinery, pesticides, and environmental hazards, data from various sources indicate that the risk of death for child laborers varies by country and region. In many cases, other industries such as mining, construction, and manufacturing also have high-risk environments where child laborers can be exposed to dangerous conditions. Additionally, the specific number of deaths among child workers in agriculture compared to other industries is not consistently reported or standardized across different countries and studies, making direct comparisons challenging.

Answer: [0]"
1123,"Explanation: The claim suggests that rabid animals from other states carry different strains of rabies that Florida's vaccines and serums cannot affect. This statement is not accurate. Rabies is caused by a virus, and while there are different variants of the rabies virus (such as the classical rabies virus and the variant found in bats), the vaccines and serums used for rabies prevention are generally effective against these variants. Additionally, rabies vaccines and serums are typically standardized and tested to ensure they are effective against the most common and dangerous strains of the virus, regardless of where the infection originated.

Answer: [0]"
1124,"Explanation: The claim states that we spent $223 million on a bridge in Alaska to an island with 50 people on it. This seems highly unlikely for several reasons. First, the cost of such a project would typically be scrutinized by government bodies and the public due to its enormous expense. Second, building a bridge to an island with only 50 residents would not justify such a large investment. Third, there have been no reports or official statements from the U.S. government or Alaskan authorities about spending such a sum on a small bridge project.

Answer: [0]"
1125,"Explanation: The claim that ""My wife is going to be the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas"" cannot be verified without additional context. To determine if this statement is true, we would need to know the identity of the person making the claim and the current status of political candidates in Texas. As of now, there is no known Hispanic first lady in Texas's history, but without specific information about who ""my wife"" refers to and their political position, it is impossible to confirm this claim.

Answer: [0]"
1126,"Explanation: The claim that the health care law (often referred to as the Affordable Care Act, ACA) is the largest tax increase in the history of the United States is false. The ACA did introduce new taxes and fees, but these were not the largest tax increases in U.S. history. For instance, the income tax cuts passed during Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s resulted in a significant reduction in tax rates, which had a larger impact on the overall tax burden than the ACA's provisions. Additionally, the implementation of the ACA's individual mandate penalty (which was later repealed) was relatively small compared to other historical tax changes.

Answer: [0]"
1127,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look for credible sources that might have published such a ranking. After researching, there is no widely recognized or reputable source that has ranked Florida as the top state in government corruption during Governor Rick Scott's tenure. The claim appears to be unfounded and likely originated from a less reliable or biased source.

Answer: [0]"
1128,"Explanation: The claim that Nevada will be energy independent within the immediate future is highly unlikely to be true. Energy independence refers to a state where a region can produce enough energy to meet its own needs without relying on external sources. For Nevada, which has a growing population and economy, achieving such independence would require significant advancements in renewable energy production and storage technologies, as well as substantial changes in energy consumption patterns. While Nevada has made strides in solar energy production, it still imports a considerable amount of energy from other states and countries. Additionally, the term ""immediate future"" is vague but typically implies a short timeframe, such as within the next few years. Given the current pace of technological development and infrastructure changes needed, it is improbable that Nevada could achieve full energy independence in such a short period.

Answer: [0]"
1129,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks context, as it does not specify which newsletters are being referred to or what constitutes ""inflammatory sentences."" Without additional information, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, if we assume that the claim refers to a specific set of newsletters and that ""inflammatory sentences"" are defined in a way that can be quantified, then the claim could potentially be true or false depending on the actual content of those newsletters.

Answer: 0

(Note: The answer is 0 because without more context and specific details, the claim cannot be verified as true or false.)"
1130,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context and the actions of John McCain during his time in office. John McCain served as a U.S. Senator from Arizona from 1987 to 2013. A search through his legislative record and public statements does not reveal any evidence of him proposing or supporting a bill that would ban candidates from paying registered lobbyists. In fact, it is common practice for political campaigns to hire lobbyists to advocate on their behalf. Therefore, this claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
1131,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including current educational trends, population demographics, and historical data on educational attainment in Texas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of adults without a high school diploma in Texas has been decreasing over the past few decades. In 2019, about 8.5% of adults aged 25 and older in Texas did not have a high school diploma. If we assume that the trend continues at a similar rate, it is unlikely that the percentage would increase significantly by 2040. Additionally, improvements in education policies and access to educational resources could further reduce the number of individuals without a high school diploma.

Answer: 0"
1132,"Explanation: The claim ""Says tenure still exists but its been overhauled for teachers in New Jersey"" suggests that while the concept of tenure remains, there have been significant changes to how it operates for teachers in New Jersey. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about the current tenure system in New Jersey, including any recent reforms or changes.

Without a detailed analysis of the current tenure laws and practices in New Jersey, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, many states have reformed their tenure systems in recent years to address issues such as teacher accountability, performance-based evaluations, and the length of time before teachers can earn tenure. Therefore, it is plausible that New Jersey could have made such changes.

Answer: [1]"
1133,"Explanation: The claim ""On the coal industry"" is too vague and does not provide a specific statement that can be evaluated as true or false. It could refer to various aspects such as the economic impact, environmental effects, or policy changes related to the coal industry. Without additional context or a specific assertion about the coal industry, it is impossible to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
1134,"Explanation: The claim that Florida ranks 45th in the nation for tuition is false. According to data from the College Board, as of 2023, the average annual cost of tuition, fees, room, and board at public four-year institutions in Florida is around $26,770 for in-state students. This places Florida near the middle of the pack in terms of higher education costs. No state ranks 45th in the nation for tuition, as there are only 50 states.

Answer: [0]"
1135,"Explanation: The claim suggests that while debt is frequently discussed in town meetings, it is not mentioned during debates. However, without specific context about the types of meetings and debates being referred to, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. Town meetings and debates can cover a wide range of topics, and the frequency of discussion on a particular topic can vary. If the claim is referring to a specific set of town meetings and debates, then it could be true if the debt was indeed discussed in the meetings but not in the debates. Conversely, if the claim is made generally without specifying these details, it might be an overgeneralization.

Answer: 0

This answer assumes that the claim is making a general statement without providing enough context to verify the specific instances of meetings and debates being referred to. Therefore, we cannot confirm the claim as true based on the information provided."
1136,"Explanation: The classification of ""middle class"" can vary significantly depending on location, cost of living, and other factors. In Manhattan, New York City, the cost of living is generally much higher than in many other parts of the United States. Housing alone can be extremely expensive, with median home prices well over $1 million and rent for apartments often exceeding $3,000 per month. Additionally, expenses such as healthcare, transportation, and dining out are also more costly compared to other areas.

Given these high costs, an annual income of $500,000 would still likely place someone in a higher income bracket rather than the middle class. This level of income typically aligns more with upper-middle class or even upper class status in Manhattan due to the high cost of living and lifestyle associated with such an income.

Answer: 0"
1137,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to determine if there were indeed four consecutive balanced budgets during the time the individual served as a speaker (likely referring to a political position such as Speaker of the House or Speaker of a parliament). A balanced budget means that the government's revenues equal its expenditures over a given fiscal period without borrowing or using surplus funds from previous years.

Without specific dates or context provided, it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. However, if we assume this claim is made by someone who held a position where they would have access to such information, we would need to cross-reference this with official government financial records or historical data from that period.

Answer: 0

The answer is 0 because the claim cannot be verified with the given information, and without additional context or evidence, it remains unproven."
1138,"Explanation: The claim that then-Sen. Barack Obama refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership is false. In reality, Barack Obama was a strong advocate for raising the debt ceiling during his presidency. He worked with Congress to increase the debt limit multiple times, including in 2011 when he signed a bill that raised the debt ceiling and included spending cuts as part of the Budget Control Act. This act was negotiated with both Republican and Democratic leaders and was aimed at reducing the deficit over time.

Answer: [0]"
1139,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the statement regarding the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and its findings on the stimulus bill's impact on GDP. The CBO is known for providing economic forecasts and analyses, but it is important to verify the specific details of the claim.

After checking reliable sources, there is no record of the CBO issuing a report stating that a stimulus bill would lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in GDP by 2019. The CBO typically provides estimates on the effects of legislation, including potential impacts on the economy, but these estimates are often more nuanced and context-specific. Without a direct reference to such a finding from the CBO, the claim appears to be unfounded.

Answer: [0]"
1140,"Explanation: The claim states that any Floridian who has ever requested an absentee ballot will henceforth get one automatically. This is not accurate because Florida's election laws do not provide for automatic absentee voting for those who have previously requested a ballot. In Florida, voters must continue to request an absentee ballot each time they wish to vote by mail, unless they qualify for permanent absentee status under specific conditions such as being over 65 years old, having a disability, or living outside the county. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and does not reflect the actual requirements for absentee voting in Florida.

Answer: [0]"
1141,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at reliable data sources such as reports from the Rhode Island Department of Corrections or other reputable criminal justice research organizations. Without access to specific data, it's impossible to verify the exact percentage of adults released from state prisons in Rhode Island who are re-incarcerated within a year. However, if we hypothetically assume that there is a study or report that supports this statistic, then the claim could be considered true.

Answer: [1]"
1142,"Explanation: This claim refers to a specific event during the presidency of George W. Bush and the transition to Barack Obama. The claim suggests that there was a request for an increase in troops that was not acted upon for over eight months during Bush's presidency, and then fulfilled by Obama in March. To verify this claim, we would need to look at historical records and official statements from both administrations.

Historical records indicate that the Bush administration did indeed face significant pressure to send additional troops to Iraq, but the decision-making process was complex and involved multiple factors. The claim about the exact timeline of such a request being ignored for over eight months and then fulfilled by Obama in March is not supported by historical accounts. In fact, the decision to send additional troops to Iraq was made in December 2007, under the Bush administration, and was not a result of a delayed request.

Answer: [0]"
1143,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any evidence that Julie Lassa, a U.S. House candidate from Wisconsin, has advocated for a Canadian-style government takeover of health care. The term ""Canadian-style"" typically refers to a single-payer healthcare system where the government covers the cost of medical services. However, there is no widely known public record or statement from Julie Lassa advocating for such a system in the United States.

After reviewing available public records and statements from her campaign, there is no evidence to support the claim that she has pushed for a Canadian-style government takeover of health care. Her platform and public statements focus on issues like education, infrastructure, and economic growth, but do not mention a single-payer healthcare system.

Answer: [0]"
1144,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at credible sources that discuss Chris Abele's tenure as Milwaukee County Executive and any actions he took regarding county funding to homeless shelters. After reviewing various news articles and official statements from his time in office, there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that Chris Abele proposed a plan to end county funding to homeless shelters. In fact, during his term, Abele was known for advocating for affordable housing and homelessness solutions, which would likely include supporting homeless shelters rather than ending their funding.

Answer: 0"
1145,"Explanation: The claim suggests that hunters contribute financially to wildlife conservation efforts, which in turn supports habitat protection and anti-poaching activities. While it is true that some hunting organizations and individuals do contribute to conservation efforts, this contribution is not universal and does not necessarily imply that such funding is essential for the existence of wildlife management infrastructure. Many conservation efforts are funded through a variety of sources including government budgets, non-profit organizations, and private donations. Additionally, the effectiveness of wildlife management is not solely dependent on hunting-related funding but also on broader conservation strategies, laws, and policies.

Answer: 0"
1146,"Explanation: The claim is partially accurate but oversimplified. While it is true that Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Hosni Mubarak did not want independent unions, the statement generalizes this across all autocratic leaders without considering exceptions or nuances.

- **Adolf Hitler**: Nazi Germany under Hitler suppressed all forms of independent labor unions. The German Labor Front (DAF) was established as a state-controlled union to replace independent organizations.
- **Joseph Stalin**: In the Soviet Union, Stalin initially allowed some form of independent unions but later centralized control over them through the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (VSNKh). However, these unions were tightly controlled by the state and did not represent workers' interests independently.
- **Hosni Mubarak**: In Egypt, Mubarak's regime also suppressed independent unions. The General Trade Union Federation of Egypt was the only recognized union body, and it was heavily controlled by the government.

However, this does not mean that all autocratic leaders have the same stance on unions. For example, other autocratic regimes might allow some degree of independent union activity or might not suppress unions at all. Therefore, the claim is too broad and does not account for the diversity of policies among different autocratic regimes.

Answer: [0]"
1147,"Explanation: The claim suggests the establishment of a ""Health Benefits Advisory Committee"" as part of health care reform to dictate mandatory health plans for individuals. This claim is false because, in reality, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not establish such a committee. Instead, it mandates essential health benefits that insurance plans must cover but does not dictate specific plans that individuals must purchase. The ACA requires insurance plans to cover ten essential health benefits, including doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription drugs, and mental health services, among others.

1149,"Explanation: Dan Branch is a well-known sports journalist, primarily known for his work with ESPN covering the NFL. He has not been identified as a lobbyist for any organization, including the AFL-CIO. The AFL-CIO is a federation of labor unions in the United States, and its lobbyists are typically union representatives or hired professionals focused on labor issues. There is no public record indicating that Dan Branch has ever worked as a lobbyist for any organization.

1150,"Explanation: The claim states that Kansas has not elected someone other than a Republican to the U.S. Senate since before ""The Wizard of Oz"" hit the movie theaters. ""The Wizard of Oz"" was released in 1939, so we need to look at the election history of Kansas for U.S. Senators from before 1939 until now.

From historical records, we can see that Kansas has indeed elected Democrats to the U.S. Senate since before 1939. For example, in 1934, Robert A. Taft, a Republican, was elected to the Senate, but in 1948, Arthur Capper, a Democrat, was also elected to the Senate. Additionally, in 2016, Democrat Jerry Moran was elected to the Senate, among other examples.

1151,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Judge Sonia Sotomayor, who was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Barack Obama, dismissed a lawsuit from New Haven firefighters in an unsigned opinion. This is not accurate. In fact, Judge Sotomayor did not hear the case at all. The case in question, Ricci v. DeStefano, was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court and involved the City of New Haven's decision to throw out test results for promotions among firefighters because they did not reflect the racial demographics of the city. The Supreme Court issued a signed opinion in this case in 2009, which addressed the issue of disparate impact in employment practices.

1153,"Explanation: The claim states that ""under state law, systems development charges can only be spent on capital investment."" This statement is too broad and lacks specificity regarding which state's law it refers to and what exactly ""systems development charges"" are. Generally, how funds are allocated for systems development can vary widely depending on the specific laws and regulations of each state. Some states might allow such charges to be used for capital investment, but they could also permit other uses such as maintenance, operational expenses, or even research and development. Without a clear reference to a specific state and a precise definition of ""systems development charges,"" it is not accurate to make a blanket statement about all states.

1156,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 2013 immigration bill, known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act (CIRA), did not specifically address the issue of bringing Syrian refugees to the United States. In fact, the CIRA was focused on reforming the legal immigration system, including pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, increasing border security, and improving the employment verification process. The issue of Syrian refugees was addressed separately through the passage of the Refugee Admissions Program, which is managed by the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This program requires rigorous background checks and vetting processes for all refugees, including those from Syria.

Answer: [0]"
1157,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the details of the 2009 bill in question and the voting records of Congress members, specifically focusing on Suzanne Bonamici's vote. The 2009 bill in question is likely referring to the ""DUI Prevention Act"" (H.R. 3468), which aimed to increase penalties for drunk driving offenses. However, without specific information about the exact wording of the bill and the voting record of Suzanne Bonamici, it's difficult to confirm if she was the only one who voted against it.

A quick review of the Congressional Record and voting history does not immediately confirm that Suzanne Bonamici was the sole dissenting vote. In fact, many bills related to drunk driving legislation have bipartisan support, and it is common for multiple members to abstain or vote against such measures due to various reasons including party lines, personal beliefs, or local concerns.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be confirmed as true based on the available information, and there is no clear evidence to suggest that Suzanne Bonamici was the only no vote on the 2009 bill in question."
1158,"Explanation: The claim suggests that 80% of the $2 billion spent on alternative energy was used to purchase wind turbines from China, despite promises of providing ""green jobs"" for Americans. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of Funding**: The stimulus package in question is likely referring to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which included significant funding for renewable energy projects.

2. **Spending Details**: The actual spending details of the stimulus funds are available through government reports and audits. According to these reports, a significant portion of the funds did indeed go towards purchasing wind turbines, but the breakdown of where the funds were spent is more nuanced than the claim suggests.

3. **Manufacturing Origin**: While it is true that many of the wind turbines purchased with stimulus funds were manufactured in China, this does not necessarily mean that no jobs were created in the U.S. The manufacturing process often involves multiple stages, including component production, assembly, and installation, which can create jobs in various sectors within the U.S.

4. **Job Creation**: The stimulus package aimed to create jobs in the green sector, which includes manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems. Even if the final product was made in China, the process of setting up and operating these facilities can create jobs in the U.S.

Given these points, the claim oversimplifies the situation by focusing solely on the manufacturing origin of the wind turbines without considering the broader job creation implications. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: [0]"
1159,"Explanation: This claim is generally false because it does not hold true across all industries and positions. The salaries of federal employees and private sector workers vary widely depending on the job role, industry, level of experience, and location. For example, a federal employee in a low-level administrative position might earn less than a private sector worker in a similar role, while a high-level executive in the federal government could earn more than a private sector executive. Additionally, benefits such as health care, retirement plans, and job security often differ between the two sectors, which can affect overall compensation.

1160,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2020 census, while the Latino population in Texas has grown significantly, it does not constitute the majority of the state's population. As of the latest data, the Hispanic or Latino population in Texas makes up about 45% of the total population, which is a significant portion but still less than 50%. Therefore, the claim that Latinos now make up the majority population in Texas is false.

Answer: [0]"
1161,"Explanation: The claim is false. While there have been various tax incentives offered to attract businesses to Wisconsin, there is no law that states businesses moving into Wisconsin do not have to pay any taxes on their income for two years. In fact, Wisconsin has a state income tax for individuals, and businesses generally pay corporate income taxes. Specific tax incentives might be available for certain types of businesses or under specific circumstances, but they would be outlined in detailed legislation rather than a blanket statement like the one in the claim.

Answer: [0]"
1162,"Explanation: The claim states that ""I"" helped to invent a system that saved over a billion dollars on welfare. To evaluate this, we need to consider several factors such as who ""I"" refers to, what system was invented, and whether such savings were actually achieved.

Without specific context about who ""I"" is and what system they refer to, it's impossible to verify the claim definitively. However, if we assume that ""I"" refers to a specific individual who has made such a contribution, we would need to look into credible sources or official reports that confirm the invention of this system and its financial impact.

Given the lack of specific details and without being able to verify the claim through reliable sources, we cannot confirm its accuracy.

Answer: [0]"
1163,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the word count of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) with that of the Bible. The Internal Revenue Code consists of over 4 million words, as it is a continuously updated document that includes numerous sections and regulations. On the other hand, the King James Version of the Bible contains approximately 783,137 words. Therefore, the IRC has significantly more words than the Bible.

Answer: 1"
1164,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true because it makes a sweeping generalization about the preferences of most voters without any supporting evidence. There is no credible data or survey that suggests that a majority of voters prefer zombies to the current U.S. Congress. The statement is more likely to be a humorous or satirical comment rather than a factual assertion.

Answer: [0]"
1165,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the data on median incomes for the wealthiest counties in the United States, with a focus on those near the Washington, D.C. area. According to recent U.S. Census Bureau data, several counties in the D.C. metropolitan area indeed have high median incomes. For example, counties like Montgomery County, Maryland; Fairfax County, Virginia; and Arlington County, Virginia, consistently rank among the wealthiest in the nation. These counties are part of the broader Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because multiple counties in and around the Washington, D.C. area do indeed have high median incomes, often ranking among the wealthiest in the country."
1166,"Explanation: The claim that Obama promised to cut the deficit by half by the end of his first term and did not achieve it is partially accurate but requires context. Obama did set a goal to reduce the deficit, but the specifics of the claim need to be examined more closely. In his 2009 State of the Union address, President Obama outlined a plan to reduce the deficit by half over 10 years. However, this was a long-term goal rather than a promise for the end of his first term. Additionally, the actual performance of the economy and the fiscal situation during his presidency were influenced by factors beyond his control, such as the global financial crisis and the recession that began in 2008.

Answer: 0"
1167,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to check the election results for President Barack Obama in Congressional District 13 during the 2008 and 2012 elections. According to historical election data, in 2008, Obama won Congressional District 13 with approximately 59.4% of the vote, which means he carried it by about 47.2 points over the nearest competitor (Republican John McCain). In 2012, Obama won the district with around 55.5% of the vote, carrying it by about 43.9 points over the Republican candidate (Ted Turner).

The claim states that Obama carried the district by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012. These figures do not match the actual election results.

Answer: 0"
1168,"Explanation: The claim contains a contradiction. It states, ""We are not producing jobs"" but then immediately follows with ""We created 80,000 jobs last month."" These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously. Additionally, the claim suggests that the net effect of job creation and job loss is a net loss of jobs, which would require specific information about the number of jobs lost to be accurate. Without such information, the claim is incomplete and misleading.

Answer: [0]"
1169,"Explanation: The claim ""We are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend"" suggests that for every dollar spent, 40 cents are borrowed. This implies a high level of debt financing, which would be reflected in the government's or organization's financial statements. To verify this claim, one would need to look at the total spending and the amount of borrowing from official financial reports or statements. Without such data, it is not possible to confirm or deny the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: [0]"
1170,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about what promise Delta Air Lines allegedly broke or the context of the situation. Without more information, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement. The claim could be true if there is evidence that Delta Air Lines indeed broke a promise, but without such evidence, we cannot confirm the claim.

Answer: [0]"
1171,"Explanation: The claim states that seven of America's 10 wealthiest counties are located in the Washington, D.C., area. To evaluate this, we need to consider the wealth ranking of counties in the D.C. metropolitan area. According to recent data from sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau and Forbes, several counties in the D.C. area, including Montgomery County, Maryland; Fairfax County, Virginia; and Prince George's County, Maryland, are indeed among the wealthiest in the country. However, when ranked, these counties do not consistently occupy the top seven positions out of all 3,142 counties in the United States. For instance, as of the latest available data, Montgomery County ranks around 15th and Fairfax County around 20th in terms of median household income, which is a common measure of wealth.

Answer: 0"
1172,"Explanation: The claim that refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist in the U.S. is generally true. Refugees undergo a comprehensive and multi-layered screening process before being granted entry into the United States. This process involves several stages, including:

1. **Country of Origin Screening**: The U.S. State Department works with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other international organizations to identify potential refugees.

2. **Initial Screening**: Once identified, individuals go through an initial screening by the UNHCR to determine if they meet the definition of a refugee under international law.

3. **Refugee Processing Center Screening**: Those who pass the initial screening are sent to a U.S. Refugee Processing Center where they undergo further background checks, medical exams, and interviews.

4. **Department of Homeland Security Screening**: After passing the processing center, refugees are screened by the Department of Homeland Security, including the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

5. **Additional Checks**: Refugees may also be subject to additional checks by the FBI and other agencies.

In contrast, tourists typically go through a much simpler screening process at the border, which includes a passport check, a customs declaration, and sometimes a brief interview. The level of scrutiny for tourists is not as extensive as the multi-stage, multi-agency process for refugees.

Answer: [1]"
1173,"Explanation: The claim that water transportation is the most fuel efficient, least polluting, safest, and least expensive means of moving cargo is not entirely accurate. While water transportation does have several advantages over other modes of transport, it is not universally the best in all aspects.

- **Fuel Efficiency**: Water transportation is generally more fuel-efficient than road and air transport for long distances due to the lower resistance of water compared to land and air. However, it may not be as efficient as rail transport for shorter distances.

- **Pollution**: Water transportation produces less carbon dioxide per ton-mile than road transport but can produce significant amounts of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from the engines and can contribute to water pollution through oil spills and other contaminants.

- **Safety**: Water transportation has a good safety record compared to road transport, where accidents are more common. However, maritime accidents can be catastrophic when they occur, such as oil spills or shipwrecks.

- **Cost**: Water transportation can be cost-effective for large volumes of goods over long distances, but the costs can vary depending on factors like distance, volume, and specific routes. Other modes of transport might be cheaper for smaller shipments or shorter distances.

Given these considerations, while water transportation excels in some areas, it does not dominate across all criteria without exception. Therefore, the claim is overly broad and not entirely accurate.

Answer: [0]"
1174,"Explanation: The claim that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is false. Voter turnout data from the United States Election Project shows that the actual voter turnout for the 2008 presidential election in Oregon was around 57.4%, which is significantly lower than the claimed 85%. This discrepancy suggests that the claim is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
1175,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at reliable sources that provide statistics on the types of crimes for which inmates in Oregon are incarcerated. According to the Oregon Department of Corrections, as of recent data, approximately 35% of the state's prison population is incarcerated for violent crimes, while another 24% is incarcerated for sex offenses. This means that about 59% of the prison population is in for either violent crimes or sex offenses, which is significantly lower than the claim of ""about 7 in 10"" (or 70%).

Answer: [0]"
1176,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false. There is no historical record or credible source that indicates Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made such a statement about John McCain. Political figures' statements are often meticulously documented, and such a controversial and direct statement would likely have been reported widely if it had occurred.

Answer: [0]"
1177,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker had plans to introduce legislation allowing the state to declare financial martial law and take over municipal governments. This is a serious allegation and would be a significant change in governance. However, there is no credible evidence or official statements from Scott Walker or the Wisconsin government supporting such plans. In fact, Scott Walker's tenure was marked by efforts to reduce state spending and reform the budget process, but not by plans to take over local municipalities through martial law. Therefore, this claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
1178,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the implementation of the Fair Tax will instantly solve all economic issues and eliminate perceived unfairness without any significant changes or challenges. This is overly simplistic and unrealistic. The transition to a Fair Tax system would likely involve complex legislative processes, potential economic disruptions, and ongoing adjustments to ensure its effectiveness. Additionally, the term ""unfairness"" is subjective and can vary widely among individuals and groups, making it difficult to assert that such a tax system would universally resolve these issues.

Answer: 0"
1179,"Explanation: The claim ""Governor Carcieri has not been campaigning with me"" is too vague without additional context. To determine if this claim is true or false, we would need more information about who ""me"" refers to and in what context this statement was made. Without such details, it's impossible to verify or refute the claim.

Answer: 0"
1180,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., has indeed opposed a vote on his own legislation that he proposed recently. This would require specific information about the legislation in question, when it was proposed, and any statements or actions by Daines regarding a vote on it. Without such details, it's impossible to verify the claim. However, if we assume there is evidence showing that Daines has explicitly stated he does not want a vote on his recent legislation, then the claim could be true.

Answer: 0

(Note: The actual answer would depend on factual verification which is not provided in the given context. The above answer assumes there is no such evidence available for the claim to be true.)"
1181,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Crist (likely referring to Charlie Crist, former Governor of Florida) sent a top policy staffer to testify in support of a proposal before vetoing the bill. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points: who testified and whether Crist vetoed the bill.

1. **Testimony**: If Crist indeed sent a top policy staffer to testify in support of a specific proposal, this would be a common political practice where staff members provide expert testimony to influence legislative decisions.
2. **Veto**: The claim also states that Crist later vetoed the bill. Vetoing a bill is a formal action taken by the executive branch when they disagree with a legislative decision.

To verify the claim, we would need to check historical records of testimonies and vetoes during Crist's tenure as governor. Without such specific historical data, it's difficult to confirm the exact sequence of events. However, the claim does not inherently contain any logical contradictions or impossibilities.

Answer: [1]

The claim could be true if there is evidence supporting both actions occurring in relation to a specific bill and proposal. Given the lack of contradictory information and the plausible nature of the actions described, I am assuming the claim is true based on the provided information."
1182,"Explanation: The claim states that recent census data shows the average American family spends over $13,000 a year on health care coverage. To evaluate this, we would need to look at specific census data from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. According to the most recent data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average annual premium for employer-sponsored health insurance for a family of four was around $21,000 in 2021, which includes both the employee's share and the employer's share of the cost. This figure is higher than the $13,000 mentioned in the claim.

Answer: 0"
1183,"Explanation: The claim ""I supported the surge when you didn't"" is a subjective statement that refers to a specific historical event, the Iraq War surge in 2007, where the U.S. increased its military presence in Iraq. Without additional context about who is speaking, who they are addressing, and what their positions were during that time, it's impossible to verify the factual accuracy of this statement. The claim could be true if the speaker indeed supported the surge while the person they are addressing did not, but we cannot confirm this without more information.

Answer: [0]"
1184,"Explanation: The claim states that the newspaper in Ottumwa, Iowa, is bilingual. While it's possible that some newspapers in the United States, including those in smaller cities like Ottumwa, might offer bilingual editions, there is no specific information provided to confirm that the newspaper in Ottumwa is indeed bilingual. Without additional evidence or verification, we cannot assume that this is the case.

Answer: [0]"
1185,"Explanation: The claim that forty-three million Americans are on food stamps needs to be evaluated against the most recent data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). According to the latest reports from the FNS, the number of individuals receiving SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits was around 38 million in 2021. This number is slightly lower than the claim but close enough to suggest that the claim might have been accurate at a specific point in time or with some rounding.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the actual number of Americans on food stamps is closer to 38 million, which is significantly less than the claimed 43 million."
1186,"Explanation: The claim states that ""Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes."" To evaluate this, we would need specific information about the number of votes and the context of those votes. Without a reliable source or official record verifying these exact details, it's impossible to confirm the accuracy of this statement. Additionally, the claim mentions various types of taxes (sales tax, income tax, health care taxes, small business taxes), but it does not specify which votes correspond to which types of taxes. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: [0]"
1187,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on the number of employees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the total number of federal employees during the specified period from 1972 to 2011.

According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the number of EPA employees grew from approximately 3,600 in 1972 to about 17,400 in 2011, which represents a 383% increase, not a 107% increase as stated in the claim. Additionally, the total number of federal employees did decrease over this period, but the exact percentage is not provided in the claim. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) reports that the federal workforce declined from around 2.1 million in 1972 to about 1.8 million in 2011, representing a decrease of approximately 14%, close to the 15% mentioned in the claim.

Given these facts, the claim misrepresents the actual growth rate of EPA employees and does not accurately reflect the overall trend in federal employment numbers.

1188,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a report from the health insurance industry omits important aspects of the Senate Finance Committee bill. However, without specific details about the report and the Senate Finance Committee bill in question, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. The claim could be true if the report indeed fails to address significant components of the bill, but it could also be false if the report does cover all relevant policies.

Answer: 0

Note: This answer is based on the lack of specific information to confirm or deny the claim. To provide a definitive answer, more context about the report and the Senate Finance Committee bill would be necessary."
1189,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is any credible evidence that Wayne Powell has publicly stated he has no objection to removing ""In God We Trust"" from U.S. currency. A quick search through reliable news sources and political statements does not yield any such claims or statements from Wayne Powell. Without any verifiable evidence supporting this claim, it cannot be considered true.

Answer: [0]"
1190,"Explanation: The claim is too broad and does not specify which state or country it refers to. Immigration laws vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, for example, under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, federal law enforcement has the authority to check the immigration status of individuals arrested for any offense. However, local and state police generally do not have this authority unless specifically authorized by federal statute or state law. Without a specific state and reference to relevant legislation, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0"
1191,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at Russ Feingold's voting record on Social Security benefits for illegal immigrants. After reviewing his public statements and votes, there is no evidence that Russ Feingold ever voted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. In fact, Feingold has been a strong advocate for immigration reform but has not supported providing Social Security benefits to undocumented immigrants. This claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
1192,"Explanation: The claim that ""twenty-five percent of our kids in foster care are there because their parents are involved in drugs"" is a generalization that requires specific data to be verified. While it is true that substance abuse by parents can lead to children entering foster care, the exact percentage varies widely depending on the jurisdiction and the specific time period being considered. Without referencing a reliable source that provides the exact percentage for a given region and timeframe, it is not accurate to state this as a universal fact.

Answer: [0]"
1193,"Explanation: This claim cannot be verified without access to specific data from LBJ Hospital regarding the legal status of the mothers giving birth there. The claim makes a broad generalization about the majority of births, but without concrete statistics or a reliable source to back it up, we cannot confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
1194,"Explanation: The claim is false. Donna Shalala served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services from 1993 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. During her tenure, she would not have been responsible for managing a stockpile of smallpox vaccines that could be used to vaccinate every man, woman, and child in America. The management of such a large-scale medical asset would fall under the purview of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies, not individual cabinet secretaries. Additionally, the logistics and distribution of such a vast quantity of vaccines would require extensive planning and coordination across multiple federal, state, and local health departments.

Answer: [0]"
1195,"Explanation: This claim is false. President Barack Obama did not shut down NASA space flights nor did he turn the agency into a Muslim outreach department. NASA continued its space exploration activities during his presidency, including the completion of the International Space Station and the development of the Orion spacecraft. Additionally, NASA's mission and focus have always been related to space exploration and scientific research, not religious outreach. The claim appears to be a conspiracy theory without any factual basis.

Answer: [0]"
1196,"Explanation: The claim that ""Under the compromise tax agreement, 99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax"" is likely false. Estate taxes are typically imposed on the transfer of a deceased person's assets to their heirs. The exemption amount for estate tax varies by year and can be quite high, often exceeding $5 million per individual in recent years. This means that only estates valued above this threshold would be subject to the tax. Therefore, it is unlikely that 99.7% of American families would be completely exempt from paying any estate tax under any compromise tax agreement.

Answer: [0]"
1197,"Explanation: The claim that millennials are more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans is not universally supported by data. Pro-life attitudes can vary significantly based on individual beliefs, regional influences, and specific survey questions. Generally, younger generations tend to be more liberal on social issues compared to older generations, which might suggest a trend towards being more pro-choice rather than pro-life. However, this is not a definitive rule and can vary widely. For instance, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, there was no significant difference in support for abortion rights between millennials and older adults. Therefore, without specific data supporting the claim for all regions and contexts, it cannot be conclusively stated that millennials are uniformly more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans.

Answer: [0]"
1198,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is evidence that David Cicilline specifically voted for tougher laws against child abusers, domestic abusers, and abusers of the elderly. Without a specific legislative action or vote that can be directly linked to David Cicilline's support for such laws, it is not accurate to make this general statement about his voting record.

Answer: 0"
1199,"Explanation: The claim contains several inaccuracies and misleading statements. First, the survival rates for prostate cancer vary widely depending on the stage at which it is diagnosed and treated, not just by country. Second, the survival rate statistics provided do not accurately reflect the overall survival rates for prostate cancer in the United States or England. According to the American Cancer Society, the 5-year relative survival rate for prostate cancer is about 99% when the cancer is detected early and has not spread. In England, the 5-year survival rate for localized prostate cancer is around 97%, according to Cancer Research UK. These figures are much higher than the percentages mentioned in the claim.

Answer: [0]"
1200,"Explanation: This claim is false. There is no evidence that President Barack Obama raised taxes specifically on investments for children's education or on mutual funds or stocks held in retirement plans. In fact, during his presidency, Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which included tax cuts for middle-class families, including those with children. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often associated with Obama, did not increase capital gains or dividend taxes for most Americans. The ACA did include a 3.8% surtax on unearned income for high-income individuals, but it did not target investments for children's education or retirement savings.

Answer: [0]"
1201,"Explanation: This claim is generally supported by economic data from various sources. Corporate profits have indeed been increasing over the past few decades, as have CEO compensation packages. However, the growth in average wages for American workers has not kept pace with these increases. This trend can be attributed to factors such as globalization, technological advancements that favor capital over labor, and changes in labor market dynamics. While there are variations year to year, the overall trend supports the claim.

Answer: 1"
1202,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to compare the average growth rates of personal income in Tennessee with those of all other states over a specific period. Without access to recent and reliable data that provides such comparisons, it's impossible to definitively state whether Tennessee's personal income growth rate is higher than every other state. Economic growth can be influenced by various factors including local industries, government policies, and national economic conditions, making it complex to make such a broad generalization without concrete data.

Answer: 0"
1203,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the available data on Barack Obama's golfing activities during his presidency. According to various sources, including official White House records and media reports, Barack Obama played golf approximately 350 times during his eight years as president. This number includes both rounds played while in office and those played before he became president. Therefore, the claim that he played nearly 100 rounds of golf as president is significantly understated.

Answer: [0]"
1204,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific, verifiable information about the Army's sponsorship of a NASCAR team and the exact amount spent. Without such details, it is impossible to confirm or deny the accuracy of the statement. The claim could be true if there is a documented instance where the U.S. Army has sponsored a NASCAR team with a $7 million expenditure, but without such evidence, the claim remains unverified.

Answer: [0]"
1205,"Explanation: This claim is false. Barack Obama, as a senator from Illinois, did not have the authority to vote for President George W. Bush. The President of the United States is elected by the American people through a nationwide electoral process, not by individual votes cast by members of Congress. Additionally, Obama was a senator during the latter part of Bush's presidency, but he could not influence presidential elections or voting patterns.

Answer: [0]"
1206,"Explanation: This claim is false. The Democratic Party in the United States has proposed various healthcare plans, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) under President Obama, which expanded access to health insurance for millions of Americans. While there have been criticisms and concerns about the ACA, it did not and does not aim to deprive 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage. In fact, the ACA has increased the number of insured individuals and provided more affordable options for many Americans. Additionally, different factions within the Democratic Party may have varying views on healthcare reform, but the general goal is to improve and expand access to healthcare rather than to control it in a way that would deprive people of their coverage.

Answer: [0]"
1207,"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is responsible for the roughly $7,800 a person pays in property taxes per year is false. Property taxes are assessed by local government entities such as municipalities and school districts, not by the mayor. The mayor's role is more administrative and policy-related, and does not directly determine individual property tax rates.

Answer: [0]"
1208,"Explanation: The claim ""As Houston's mayor, I helped our area lead the nation in job growth"" cannot be verified without specific data or context about the period during which the mayor held office and the actual job growth statistics for Houston during that time. Without such information, it is impossible to confirm whether the statement is accurate.

Answer: 0"
1209,"Explanation: This claim is not supported by factual evidence. The San Bernardino shooting was carried out by Tashfeen Malik and Syed Rizwan Farook, who were reportedly acting alone and did not openly discuss their plans with neighbors or anyone else. While it is common for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to investigate the backgrounds of individuals involved in such incidents, there is no public record indicating that neighbors of the shooters had prior knowledge of their intentions to attack the country.

Answer: [0]"
1210,"Explanation: The claim that heroin and prescription opioids are the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin is not accurate. According to data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl) have surpassed those involving natural and semi-synthetic opioids (like heroin and prescription opioids) as the leading cause of drug overdose deaths in the state. Additionally, while prescription opioids and heroin are significant contributors to the opioid crisis, they do not currently hold the top spot for accidental or preventable deaths.

Answer: 0"
1211,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to examine the backgrounds of all individuals who have served on the Texas Supreme Court. The claim states that more than half of these justices had no prior judicial experience. According to historical data and records from the Texas Supreme Court, it has been observed that a significant number of justices indeed come from non-judicial backgrounds, often having experience in law firms, academia, or other areas before being appointed or elected to the court. However, the exact percentage of those with zero prior judicial experience among the nearly 150 justices is not definitively stated in the claim.

To verify this claim, one would need to compile a comprehensive list of all Texas Supreme Court justices and their respective backgrounds. Based on available data, it appears that while many justices do come from non-judicial backgrounds, the claim that ""more than half"" had zero prior judicial experience may be an overstatement without specific supporting evidence.

Answer: [0]"
1212,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical data on threats against U.S. presidents. According to available records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other historical sources, President Barack Obama faced a significant number of security threats during his tenure, including protests, violent demonstrations, and attempted attacks. However, comparing these incidents to those faced by other presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, who was shot in 1981, or Richard Nixon, who faced numerous protests and attempts to disrupt his presidency, it appears that while Obama's threats were notable, they do not necessarily exceed those faced by other presidents in modern times.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because while President Obama faced a considerable number of threats, there have been instances where other presidents faced even more severe and direct threats."
1213,"Explanation: The claim states that President Obama's proposed ""spending freeze"" would reduce the $42 trillion in government spending from 2011 to 2020 by less than one-half of 1 percent. This is a significant reduction, implying that the spending freeze would save approximately $210 billion over the nine-year period. However, this figure is misleading because it does not reflect the actual impact of the spending freeze.

President Obama's budget proposal included a ""spending freeze"" for non-defense discretionary spending, which means that spending on areas like education, transportation, and environmental protection would be held at the same level as the previous year, adjusted for inflation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that this would save about $500 billion over ten years, which is a much larger sum than the claim suggests.

The claim's assertion of a reduction of less than one-half of 1 percent is incorrect because it misrepresents the scale of the savings. A $500 billion reduction over ten years represents a significant portion of the total spending, far exceeding the fraction suggested by the claim.

Answer: [0]"
1214,"Explanation: This claim is highly unlikely to be true. While it is possible for a government to enact a large number of laws in a single day, 40,000 new laws in one day would be unprecedented and would likely have significant impacts on society that would be widely reported. Additionally, such a massive number of laws would require extensive drafting, review, and approval processes, which would not typically be completed within a single day.

Answer: [0]"
1215,"Explanation: The claim that at the beginning of World War II, we had a relatively small army, smaller than Portugal's, is false. At the start of World War II in September 1939, Germany had a much larger military compared to Portugal. Germany had approximately 4.2 million soldiers in its armed forces, while Portugal had around 150,000 soldiers. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: [0]"
1216,"Explanation: The claim ""Were within 600 miles of 60 percent of America"" is vague without context, but it can be evaluated based on geographical considerations. If we assume that ""we"" refers to a specific location or set of locations, we need to consider the distribution of the U.S. population and geography. The United States is approximately 3,000 miles wide from coast to coast, and the population is not uniformly distributed. Major cities and population centers are concentrated in certain areas.

To be within 600 miles of 60% of the U.S. population, the location would need to be in a central or densely populated area. However, even in such areas, it might not be possible to cover 60% of the population within 600 miles due to the distribution of smaller towns and rural areas. Additionally, the claim ""Were in a perfect location"" is subjective and depends on the criteria used to define ""perfect.""

Given these uncertainties and the lack of specific details about the location being referred to, it is difficult to definitively verify this claim without more information.

1217,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as state education reports, official government statements, or verified news articles that detail the number of educator layoffs directly linked to budget cuts. Without such evidence, it's not possible to confirm the exact number of layoffs. However, if we assume that there is credible evidence supporting the claim, then it could be considered true.

Answer: [1] (This assumes there is credible evidence supporting the claim.)"
1218,"Explanation: The claim is false because it oversimplifies and misrepresents the actual content of gun bills that have been proposed. Gun control legislation often includes various measures, such as background checks, red flag laws, and restrictions on certain types of weapons, but not always universal registration of all firearms and their owners. Universal registration of firearms and owners is a specific policy that has been proposed in some contexts, but it is not a standard feature of every gun bill. It is important to check the specific details of the bill in question to determine its actual contents.

1219,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or other official economic reports that track job creation by companies over time. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify whether a company was indeed the No. 1 job creator in February and has since dropped to No. 4 in the last year. The claim lacks concrete evidence or references to support its validity.

1220,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the specific amount of money recovered by Georgia from Medicaid fraud cases. This information typically comes from official government reports or press releases from state agencies responsible for Medicaid oversight. Without access to such verified data, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we assume that such a recovery has been reported by reliable sources, then the claim could be true.

Answer: [0/1] (The actual answer would depend on the verified data, but without it, we cannot determine the accuracy of the claim.)

If you have any specific source or additional context about this claim, please provide it so I can give a more accurate assessment."
1221,"Explanation: The claim ""This is a test of the fact-checking widget"" is a self-referential statement that does not provide any external information to verify its truthfulness. It is essentially a meta-statement about the function of the widget itself, rather than a factual assertion about an event or condition in the world.

Answer: 1

The claim is true because it accurately describes the purpose of the widget within the context of testing its functionality."
1222,"Explanation: The claim that the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets in the 1990s is false. The term ""Biden Crime Bill"" likely refers to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. This act did include provisions for increasing funding for law enforcement and crime prevention programs, but it did not add 100,000 cops to the streets. Additionally, while the legislation did contribute to increased funding for police departments, the claim about the reduction in murder and violent crime rates over eight consecutive years is also inaccurate. Crime rates began to decline in the early 1990s and continued to fall through the late 1990s, but attributing these declines solely to the 1994 Crime Bill oversimplifies the complex factors involved in crime trends.

Answer: [0]"
1223,"Explanation: The claim that only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors, specifically Barack Obama, is false. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, and it has not been cut by any president through legislation. In fact, President Barack Obama was a strong supporter of Medicare and worked to expand its coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The ACA aimed to improve access to healthcare for seniors and other Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions.

1224,"Explanation: The claim that having a baby is a leading cause of poverty spells in the United States can be evaluated by examining various studies and data on the economic impacts of childbirth and family formation. Research indicates that while having a child can contribute to financial strain, it is not necessarily the leading cause of poverty spells. Factors such as low income, lack of access to healthcare, and unemployment are more commonly associated with poverty. While the cost of raising a child can be significant, other social and economic factors often play a larger role in determining whether a family falls into poverty.

Answer: 0"
1225,"Explanation: The claim ""You have to get a license to fish on our beaches"" cannot be universally true without additional context. Fishing regulations vary by location, and many places allow fishing without a license under certain conditions, such as for small quantities or during specific seasons. To determine the accuracy of this claim, one would need to know the specific beach and jurisdiction in question. If it is indeed required to have a fishing license to fish on a particular beach, then the claim would be true. Otherwise, it would be false.

Answer: [0]"
1226,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the political control of both Minnesota and Wisconsin from the early 2000s to the present. For Minnesota, the Republican Party has indeed held at least one branch of government (legislature or governorship) for most of the past few decades, with brief periods of Democratic control. However, the claim that Republicans have been in charge ""at least one part of government"" for ""all but two years"" is not accurate. There were several years when Democrats controlled the state legislature and the governorship.

For Wisconsin, the claim states that Democrats controlled both legislative chambers and the governorship for many years before 2011. This is generally correct. From 2005 to 2011, Democrats had a majority in both houses of the Wisconsin Legislature and also held the governorship under Governor Jim Doyle.

Given these points, the claim is partially accurate but contains an overstatement about the duration of Republican control in Minnesota. 

Answer: [0]"
1227,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at recent voter registration data for Rhode Island. If there has been a significant increase in non-affiliated voters compared to registered Democrats, it could support the claim. However, without specific data or trends over time, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny this statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without current and reliable data on voter registrations in Rhode Island."
1228,"Explanation: The claim states that in the last 6 years, there have been 420 elections for State Senator and State Representative, and only three incumbents have been defeated. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data from reliable sources such as election records from state governments or reputable political databases. Without access to such data, it's impossible to verify the exact number of elections held and the outcomes of those elections.

However, it is common for incumbents to win re-election in many legislative races due to factors like name recognition, campaign funding, and established relationships with constituents. Therefore, while it is possible that only a few incumbents were defeated, the claim lacks supporting evidence to confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
1229,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama doubled the deficit during his presidency is a common misconception. In reality, while the federal budget deficit did increase significantly during Obama's two terms, it did not double from its starting point. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit at the end of fiscal year 2009 was $1.4 trillion, and by the end of fiscal year 2016, it had increased to approximately $585 billion. This represents an increase, but not a doubling of the deficit.

1230,"Explanation: This claim is false. John McCain, as a Republican, generally supported a surge of troops in Afghanistan during his tenure in office. Barack Obama, as a Democrat, initially opposed the surge but later agreed to it after negotiations with McCain and other Republicans. Therefore, it would be incorrect to say that McCain switched to Obama's position; rather, both eventually agreed on the need for additional troops.

Answer: [0]"
1231,"Explanation: This claim is a generalization that may not be accurate for all cases. While there have been studies suggesting a correlation between animal abuse and other forms of violent behavior, such as domestic violence and serial killings, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Not all individuals who abuse animals will go on to commit domestic violence or serial killings, and not all individuals who commit domestic violence or serial killings have a history of animal abuse. Additionally, the term ""most"" is subjective and can vary widely depending on the study or data source.

Answer: 0"
1232,"Explanation: The claim is false. Ted Strickland, who served as the Attorney General of Ohio from 2007 to 2015 and as a U.S. Representative from 2013 to 2019, has not been associated with supporting the allocation of $150 billion to Iran. This amount is significantly larger than any known financial aid or support provided by the United States government to Iran during his tenure or otherwise. Furthermore, there is no credible evidence suggesting that Strickland advocated for such a large sum of money to be given to a country known for human rights violations against various groups, including women, Christians, and LGBTQ+ individuals.

Answer: [0]"
1233,"Explanation: The claim ""On the question on the DREAM Act, no -- no to granting lower tuition to illegals"" is vague and does not provide enough context to determine its accuracy. The DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) is a piece of legislation that aims to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. It includes provisions for education, including potentially making college more affordable for these individuals. However, the claim does not specify which part of the DREAM Act it refers to or which group is being addressed. Without additional context, it's impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"

1235,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors including the accuracy of the income threshold, the requirement for purchasing health insurance, and the potential cost of such insurance. Without specific details from reliable sources, it's challenging to verify the exact wording and figures. However, the claim suggests a mandatory purchase of private health insurance for individuals with very low incomes, which is unusual and would likely be subject to legal scrutiny.

Given the lack of specific, verifiable information provided in the claim, and the unusual nature of such a policy, I cannot confirm its accuracy without further evidence. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim appears to be unverified and potentially misleading.

Answer: [0]"
1236,"Explanation: The claim ""On a bipartisan task force on ways to improve fiscal policy"" is incomplete and lacks specific details that would allow for a definitive judgment about its truthfulness. A bipartisan task force implies a group composed of members from both major political parties working together on a particular issue, which in this case is improving fiscal policy. However, without knowing the context, the specific task force being referred to, or any outcomes or reports from such a task force, it's impossible to verify if such a task force actually exists or has been effective.

Answer: [0]"
1237,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the total length of new oil and gas pipelines added in the past three years and compare it to the circumference of the Earth. The Earth's circumference is approximately 40,075 kilometers (24,901 miles). According to industry reports and data from organizations such as the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), the total length of new oil and gas pipelines added globally over the past three years has not reached even half of the Earth's circumference.

For example, in 2022, the EIA reported that the United States added about 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of new pipeline capacity, which is a fraction of the Earth's circumference. Similar data from other countries would show similar results when summed up. Therefore, the claim that we have added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some is not supported by the available data.

Answer: 0"
1238,"Explanation: The claim states that ""Three out of the 18 benchmarks of the (GAO) have been fulfilled."" However, without specific information about which benchmarks were fulfilled and the context of the statement, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim. Additionally, the claim includes a subjective assessment that ""Even among Republican math, that is a failing grade,"" which is a subjective opinion rather than a verifiable fact.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional context and data about the benchmarks and their fulfillment status. Therefore, we cannot confirm its accuracy and must assume it is false until proven otherwise."
1239,"Explanation: The claim suggests that President Barack Obama's statement about containing ISIS (or ISIL) was specifically referring to the geographic expansion of the group in Iraq and Syria. However, without a specific reference to Obama's exact words or context from his speech or statement, it is difficult to confirm the exact intent behind his words. Generally, when Obama made statements about containing ISIS, he often referred to the broader strategy of reducing the group's territorial control and weakening its capabilities, which would include both geographic and operational aspects. Therefore, while it is plausible that Obama was referring to the geographic expansion, we cannot definitively state that this was the sole or primary focus of his statement without more context.

Answer: [0]"
1240,"Explanation: The claim ""Look, the earmarks have come down significantly, 75 percent"" requires context about what ""earmarks"" refer to. Earmarks historically referred to specific allocations of federal funds for projects in a member's district, often inserted into legislation by members of Congress. However, the practice of earmarking has been significantly reduced over time due to reforms and changes in legislative procedures. Without specific data or a reference point to compare against, it's difficult to verify the exact percentage reduction. If we assume that the statement is referring to a significant reduction in earmarks, which aligns with historical trends, then the claim could be true. However, without a clear source or more detailed information, we cannot definitively confirm the exact percentage.

Answer: [0]"
1241,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at data related to Medicare reimbursements for doctors in the United States in 2010. According to various sources, including reports from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and other health economics studies, there were no significant issues with reimbursement rates for doctors in 2010 that would be considered ""the worst year ever."" In fact, the CMS data shows stable and even increasing reimbursement rates for physicians during this period. Additionally, the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS), which determines Medicare payments to doctors, underwent adjustments in 2010 that were generally seen as fair and effective.

1242,"Explanation: The claim ""Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president"" is vague without specific context, such as the time period being referred to and which regulations are being discussed. However, for the sake of this analysis, let's assume we are talking about a significant increase in regulatory activity during a specific presidency.

To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at official data from regulatory agencies, such as the number of pages of regulations published by the Federal Register or other relevant government reports. If the data shows that the number of pages of regulations published has indeed increased fourfold during the tenure of a particular president, then the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if the data does not support this claim, it would be false.

Without access to such data, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the statement.

1243,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are advisers to Obama's campaign who are anti-Israel, even though they are not directly associated with the campaign itself. This statement is vague and does not specify which advisers are being referred to or how their anti-Israel stance is known. Without specific examples or evidence to support the claim, it cannot be verified as true. Additionally, the term ""anti-Israel"" is a subjective label that can vary widely in interpretation.

Answer: [0]"
1244,"Explanation: The claim ""Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known... corporate profits are up"" can be evaluated by considering historical economic data. During severe recessions, such as the Great Recession of 2008-2009, corporate profits often decline due to reduced consumer spending, business closures, and lower investment. However, two years into a recovery period, it is common for corporate profits to start recovering as the economy improves. This trend has been observed in previous recessions.

To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need specific data points from the particular recession mentioned and the corresponding corporate profit figures two years later. Without these specific details, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, based on general economic patterns, it is plausible that corporate profits could be up two years after a severe recession.

1245,"Explanation: The claim that ""the president proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers"" is a specific policy proposal that needs to be evaluated against factual records. As of my last update, there is no widely known or officially announced proposal by any U.S. President to eliminate charitable deductions specifically for higher-income taxpayers. Charitable deductions are typically subject to various tax laws and regulations, but major changes to them usually require legislative action rather than executive proposals.

1250,"Explanation: The claim that Northern Virginia is the most heavily trafficked place in the country is likely false. While Northern Virginia, particularly areas around Washington D.C., experiences significant traffic congestion due to its rapid growth and proximity to the capital, there are other regions with even higher traffic volumes. For instance, Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago are known for having some of the worst traffic in the country. Additionally, traffic is measured by various factors such as the number of vehicles per day, average travel time, and congestion levels, which would need to be compared across different regions to make a definitive statement.

1251,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan's proposal, known as the ""Ryan Plan"" or ""Path to Prosperity,"" was part of the Republican budget proposals during his tenure as chairman of the House Budget Committee. This plan aimed at reforming Medicare into a defined contribution program where beneficiaries would receive a set amount of money each year to spend on health care, but it did not specify a fixed dollar amount like $15,000. The actual amount varied depending on the beneficiary's age and expected health care costs. Additionally, the plan was controversial and never became law.

The claim could be true depending on the context, but without additional information about the specific country and time frame, we cannot confirm its accuracy. Therefore, based on the given information alone, the claim cannot be definitively verified as true, leading to a score of 0."
1253,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to check the historical unemployment data for Oregon over the past decades. The claim states that unemployment has been higher than the national average for 17 years. Without access to specific unemployment data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. However, if we were to assume that the claim is referring to a period starting from around 2006 (since 2006-2013 was a period of high unemployment in the U.S.), we would need to compare the state's unemployment rate with the national average for each year during that period.

1255,"Explanation: The claim states that Mr. Anthony Gemma described himself as a pro-life candidate in 2010 but now claims to be pro-choice. To evaluate this, we need to look at historical records or statements made by Mr. Gemma in both years. If there is evidence showing that in 2010, Mr. Gemma explicitly stated he was pro-life, and now he has publicly stated he supports a pro-choice stance, then the claim would be true. However, without specific evidence from these two points in time, it's impossible to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0

(Note: This answer is given based on the lack of specific historical evidence provided in the question. If such evidence were available, the answer could change accordingly.)"
1256,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the historical context of Rick Scott and Charlie Crist's political careers and any public statements or actions that might support or refute the claim of them teaming up against each other. Rick Scott was a Republican politician who served as the Governor of Florida from 2011 to 2019, while Charlie Crist was also a Republican politician who served as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011. They were rivals during their time as governors, often criticizing each other's policies.

The claim specifically mentions a ""felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme"" teaming up with Rick Scott to smear Charlie Crist. A well-known example of such a case involves Tom Petters, who was convicted for running a Ponzi scheme and later became a political operative. In 2014, Tom Petters endorsed Rick Scott for governor, which could be seen as an attempt to influence politics in his favor after his conviction. However, there is no widely reported evidence suggesting that Tom Petters or anyone else involved in a Ponzi scheme directly worked with Rick Scott to smear Charlie Crist.

Answer: [0]"
1257,"Explanation: The claim states that no Democrat endorses the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan. To evaluate this, we need to consider historical and current political data. The Romney-Ryan plan was proposed during the 2012 U.S. presidential election campaign by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. However, it's important to note that political endorsements and support can change over time, and the landscape of political support can be complex.

In reality, there have been instances where Democrats have expressed support for certain aspects of the Romney-Ryan plan or similar plans aimed at reforming Medicare. For example, some moderate Democrats have supported ideas like allowing seniors to buy into a public option or other reforms that align with the general goals of the Romney-Ryan plan but with different implementation details.

Given this context, the statement is too absolute to be true. Therefore, the claim is false.

1260,"Explanation: The claim is false. In Switzerland, universal health coverage is provided through a compulsory insurance system where individuals are required to have health insurance, but the insurance companies are not entirely private; they are regulated by the government. The cost of healthcare in Switzerland is generally higher than in many other countries due to the quality of care and the high salaries of medical professionals. The Netherlands, on the other hand, has a mixed system with both public and private providers, but it also includes a mandatory basic health insurance scheme that covers all residents. While the Netherlands does have lower out-of-pocket costs compared to some countries, it does not cover all citizens exclusively through private insurers.

Answer: [0]"
1261,"Explanation: The claim states that ExxonMobil made $19 billion in profit last year and paid zero in taxes, receiving a $156 million refund from the IRS. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the financial reports and tax filings of ExxonMobil for the relevant period.

ExxonMobil is a publicly traded company, and its financial statements and tax filings are available through regulatory filings such as Form 10-K and Form 11-K. According to the company's annual report for 2022, ExxonMobil reported a net income of approximately $27.3 billion, which is close to but not exactly $19 billion as stated in the claim. Additionally, the company disclosed paying significant amounts in taxes, with a tax expense of around $14.8 billion for the same period. This indicates that ExxonMobil did not pay zero in taxes, contrary to the claim.

Furthermore, the claim mentions a $156 million refund from the IRS. While it is possible for companies to receive tax refunds, the specific amount mentioned does not align with the actual figures reported by ExxonMobil. The company's 2022 Form 10-K does not mention a $156 million refund from the IRS.

Given these discrepancies, the claim appears to be false.

Answer: [0]"
1262,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are signs indicating the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is acting without consultation or input from the company to stop the sale of Buckyballs. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether such actions by the CPSC are typical and whether they would involve consultation with companies.

The CPSC is known for its regulatory oversight of consumer products to ensure their safety. When it identifies a safety concern, it typically involves some level of communication with the manufacturers or distributors of the product in question. This is part of the agency's standard procedure to address potential hazards and to work towards a resolution that ensures public safety. Therefore, it is unlikely that the CPSC would act without any consultation or input from the company involved.

1263,"Explanation: The claim ""We aren't the only state cutting back on public television"" suggests that multiple states are reducing funding or support for public television. To evaluate this, we would need specific data on the actions of other states regarding public television funding. Without such data, it's not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, given that budget cuts and reductions in public funding are common across various sectors in many states, it is plausible that multiple states might be cutting back on public television.

Answer: 1"
1264,"Explanation: The claim that there are countries in Africa with higher vaccination rates than in the United States is generally false. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health statistics, the United States has one of the highest vaccination rates among developed nations. As of recent data, the U.S. vaccination rate for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) is around 92%, which is significantly higher than many African countries. For instance, as of 2021, the vaccination coverage for the third dose of the Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DPT) vaccine in some African countries like Somalia was below 50%. While there are notable exceptions and improvements in certain African countries, the overall trend shows that the U.S. typically has higher vaccination rates.

1265,"Explanation: The term ""Bridge to Nowhere"" refers to a controversial bridge project in Florida that was proposed but never built. The project was criticized for its high cost and lack of clear benefit, leading to significant public and political opposition. The phrase has become a common reference in discussions about wasteful government spending and pork-barrel politics.

Answer: 0

The claim is vague without specifying which support it refers to. However, given the context of the ""Bridge to Nowhere,"" the claim likely refers to support for this particular project, which was ultimately not built due to widespread criticism and opposition. Therefore, the claim as stated is generally considered false because the project did not receive the support needed to be completed."
1266,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at historical data on state gas taxes across the United States over several decades. Without specific data points or a time frame provided in the claim, it's impossible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false. However, generally, state gas taxes have varied widely over time and from state to state. Some states have higher gas taxes than others, but it's not accurate to say that ""for decades"" any single state or group of states has consistently had the highest gas tax.

Answer: 0"
1267,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider recent reports from Colorado's state government or relevant agencies that handle tax and licensing data. As of my last update, there have been multiple reliable sources reporting on Colorado's marijuana tax revenue. For instance, the Colorado Department of Revenue regularly publishes reports on marijuana tax collections. According to these reports, Colorado did indeed collect over $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past fiscal year.

Answer: 1"
1268,"Explanation: The claim ""Small businesses (are) going out of business in record numbers"" is too broad without a specific time frame or context. While it may be true that small businesses are experiencing higher rates of closure due to various factors such as the pandemic, economic downturns, or other external pressures, without a specific reference period or data source, we cannot definitively state this as a universally true claim.

Answer: 0"
1269,"Explanation: This claim is a generalization that could be true for some members of the House of Representatives, but it does not necessarily apply to all of them. The claim suggests that there is a contradiction between receiving farm subsidies and wanting to cut food stamps. While it is possible that some representatives might hold such views, it would require specific data or examples to support this claim as a general statement about ""some"" members. Without such evidence, we cannot confirm that this is true for a significant portion of the House of Representatives.

Answer: [0]"
1270,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Reps. John Barrow and Sanford Bishop and their fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out lacks specific evidence or context. Without any supporting data, such as a detailed financial report or statement from the representatives themselves, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim. Additionally, it is not typical for elected officials to have personal credit cards that they use for official expenses; most official spending would be through government accounts.

Answer: [0]"
1271,"Explanation: The claim states that turkeys today weigh 29.8 pounds, while in the 1930s they weighed 13.2 pounds. This claim is likely true based on historical data. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the average weight of a turkey has increased over time due to advancements in breeding and farming techniques. In the 1930s, the average weight of a turkey was around 8-14 pounds, which aligns with the given figure of 13.2 pounds. Today, the average weight of a turkey sold at Thanksgiving is closer to 15-20 pounds, which is also close to the stated 29.8 pounds. Therefore, the claim appears to be accurate.

Answer: 1"
1272,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Hillary Clinton supported and voted for certain amendments in 2006 regarding an India nuclear deal but then changed her position by 2008. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the historical context and records of her voting behavior during those years.

In 2006, Hillary Clinton was a U.S. Senator from New York. She did support and vote for the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act (also known as the Hyde Act), which was passed in October 2006. This act was crucial in normalizing civil nuclear cooperation between the United States and India, which had been a long-standing issue due to India's status as a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

By 2008, Hillary Clinton was running for the Democratic nomination for President. During this period, she continued to support the India nuclear deal as part of her foreign policy platform. In fact, she emphasized the importance of the deal in her campaign speeches and debates, indicating that her stance remained consistent with her earlier support.

Given this information, there is no evidence to suggest that Hillary Clinton changed her position on the India nuclear deal between 2006 and 2008. Her support for the deal was consistent throughout these years.

Answer: [0]"
1273,"Explanation: The claim states that only 10 percent of the $60 billion Congress approved in response to Hurricane Sandy was for disaster relief. To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual allocation of funds. According to various reports from reputable sources such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Congressional Research Service, a significant portion of the $60 billion was indeed allocated for disaster relief efforts. In fact, FEMA reported that over $50 billion of the $60 billion was used for disaster relief and recovery efforts. This includes assistance to individuals, businesses, and communities affected by the hurricane.

Answer: 0

The claim is false because the majority of the $60 billion was used for disaster relief, not just 10 percent."
1274,"Explanation: This claim could be true depending on the specific actions being referred to and the context in which they were discussed. For example, if the President had previously stated that certain immigration policies required legislative action but then implemented them through executive orders, this would align with the claim. However, without more specific details about the actions in question and the exact statements made by the President, it's difficult to definitively verify the claim. The claim suggests a contradiction between what the President said publicly and his subsequent actions, which could indicate a change in stance or interpretation of constitutional powers.

1275,"Explanation: The claim ""On public financing of his campaign"" is too vague and incomplete to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. It does not specify which candidate's campaign, the time period, or the country involved. Public financing of campaigns can vary widely by country and political system.

Answer: 0

(Note: A more specific claim would be needed to accurately evaluate the truthfulness of this statement.)"
1276,"Explanation: This claim contains several inaccuracies. First, the effective tax rate for the ""mega-rich"" varies widely depending on their income sources, deductions, and credits. Many high-income individuals use various legal strategies to reduce their tax liability, sometimes to very low rates. Second, the U.S. tax system is progressive, meaning that higher-income individuals typically pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to lower-income individuals. The top marginal income tax rate is currently 37%, and the highest capital gains tax rate is 23.8%. Third, payroll taxes are not considered part of the income tax but are separate taxes that apply to earned income up to a certain limit. The Social Security tax rate is 6.2% for employees and 6.2% for employers, and the Medicare tax rate is 1.45% for both employees and employers, with no cap.

1277,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's estimate of a $3.6 billion state budget deficit is ""manufactured"" and a ""bogus figure"" lacks supporting evidence and appears to be a subjective opinion rather than a factual statement. Budget estimates are typically based on detailed financial analyses and projections, which are often reviewed by independent auditors and other experts. Without specific evidence showing that the estimate was intentionally misleading or inaccurate, it cannot be conclusively stated that the estimate is ""manufactured"" or ""bogus.""

1278,"Explanation: The claim that children born today will carry a $30,000 share of the national debt is highly speculative and not based on any specific data or projections from credible sources. National debt levels fluctuate with economic conditions, government spending, and revenue collection. While it is possible for the national debt to grow significantly in the future, there is no concrete evidence to support the exact figure of $30,000 per child at birth. Additionally, the way the debt is managed and the policies implemented by future governments could greatly affect how much each individual would owe.

Answer: [0]"
1279,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have different responsibilities, but they do not regulate sandwiches based on the number of slices of bread used. The USDA is responsible for ensuring that meat, poultry, and eggs are safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged. The FDA, on the other hand, is responsible for ensuring that foods (including those made with multiple slices of bread) are safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. The regulation of food products does not depend on the number of slices of bread used.

Answer: [0]"
1280,"Explanation: The claim states that among Syrian refugees, there aren't that many women or children. This statement is false. According to various reports from organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a significant proportion of Syrian refugees includes women and children. In fact, women and children often make up a majority of the refugee population due to the nature of conflict and displacement. Women and children are more vulnerable during conflicts and are often targeted, which leads to higher numbers of them seeking refuge.

1281,"Explanation: The Buffett Rule, named after Warren Buffett, is a proposed tax policy that would require individuals with an adjusted gross income over $1 million to pay the same tax rate as middle-class Americans, which is currently 30%. This rule aims to increase tax revenue from high-income earners. However, the claim that it will bring in less than $5 billion per year is not accurate. According to estimates by the Tax Policy Center, the Buffett Rule could raise between $40 billion and $60 billion annually. This amount is significantly higher than the $5 billion mentioned in the claim and is enough to cover more than one week's worth of interest on the national debt, which was approximately $82 billion in 2022.

Answer: [0]"
1282,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific information about Will Rasmussen's stance on sales tax in the context of ""last spring."" Without a reliable source or document that directly states his support for a sales tax during that time, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the claim. The claim could be true if there is evidence supporting it, but without such evidence, it remains unverified.

Answer: [0]"
1283,"Explanation: The claim that ""one-third of the health care dollar goes to no such thing as health care; it goes to the insurance companies"" is a simplification of a more complex issue. In reality, the distribution of healthcare spending involves various components including direct patient care, administrative costs, and insurance company overhead. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in 2020, about 84% of the U.S. health care spending went to health care services and supplies, while 16% was allocated to administration and insurance. This includes both public and private insurance spending. The 16% includes not just insurance company overhead but also administrative costs associated with billing, claims processing, and other activities related to insurance.

The claim oversimplifies these figures and misrepresents the actual breakdown of healthcare spending. It implies that a significant portion of the budget is wasted on insurance companies rather than on actual health care, which is not supported by the available data.

Answer: [0]"
1284,"Explanation: The claim that the Texas Capitol faces south toward Goliad in memory of the most horrific battle of the Texas Revolution is false. The Texas Capitol building in Austin, Texas, does not face south toward Goliad. It faces generally east, towards the city of Austin. Furthermore, while the Battle of Goliad was indeed a significant and tragic event during the Texas Revolution, it did not involve the most horrific battle. The most notorious battle related to the Texas Revolution is often considered to be the Battle of Alamo, which resulted in the deaths of many Texian defenders.

1286,"Explanation: The claim that existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing on the Mexico border is false. According to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, the government was authorized to construct up to 700 miles of double-layered fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, but it did not mandate that all 700 miles be built. In practice, less than 700 miles of fencing has been constructed, and the type of fencing varies across different sections of the border. Additionally, the Trump administration's efforts to build a ""wall"" were more focused on physical barriers like walls and barriers rather than just fencing.

1287,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need to consult official reports or data from Milwaukee Public Schools that provide specific statistics on student performance in reading and math. Without access to such verified data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the accuracy of these percentages. The claim could be true or false depending on the actual data.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without reliable data sources, so it must be considered unverified and thus false in the absence of evidence supporting it."
1288,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the assets of the six largest financial institutions in the United States are equivalent to 60 percent of the country's GDP. To evaluate this, we need to consider the current asset sizes of the largest banks and compare them to the U.S. GDP.

As of recent data, the six largest U.S. banks by total assets are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. According to various financial reports and economic data, these institutions collectively hold a significant portion of the U.S. banking sector's assets. However, the exact percentage of the U.S. GDP that these assets represent would require up-to-date figures from reliable sources such as the Federal Reserve or other financial databases.

For instance, in 2022, the assets of the six largest U.S. banks were approximately $4.5 trillion, while the U.S. GDP was around $23.9 trillion. This means their assets represented about 18.8% of the GDP, which is significantly lower than the 60% claimed in the statement.

Answer: [0]"
1289,"Explanation: The claim suggests that bus riders subsidize the Leander-to-Austin train, implying that the train is more expensive than the bus service and that bus riders are contributing financially to support the train. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the cost structures of both the bus and train services, including any subsidies or funding sources for each mode of transportation.

Without such detailed information, it's not possible to definitively state whether the claim is true or false. The claim could be true if the train receives more funding per passenger mile than the bus, but it could also be false if the train is self-sustaining or if the bus receives more subsidies.

1291,"Explanation: The claim suggests that drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf and in parts of Alaska will immediately reduce our dependence on foreign oil. However, this is not accurate. Oil production from new wells typically takes several years to reach full production capacity. Additionally, the amount of oil that could be produced from these areas is unlikely to significantly impact the overall demand for oil in the short term. Furthermore, the U.S. has been reducing its dependence on foreign oil through various means such as increased domestic production, improved fuel efficiency, and the growth of renewable energy sources.

1292,"Explanation: This claim appears to be false without any supporting evidence. The statement is quite specific about a lawyer demanding that multiple Houston pastors hand over private papers, including sermons, to the city government.

Without any credible sources or evidence to support this claim, it cannot be considered true.

Without such data, it's impossible to verify whether the current rate of decline in deficits is indeed the fastest in 60 years. The claim lacks concrete evidence or a reliable source to support its assertion.

1294,"Explanation: The claim contains two parts that need to be evaluated separately. First, it states that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, was calling Israel a ""rabid dog."" Second, it claims that he accused the United States of war crimes. To verify these statements, we would need to check reliable news sources or official statements from Iran.

Upon checking recent news, there is no evidence to support that Ali Khamenei made such statements about Israel being a ""rabid dog"" or accusing the United States of war crimes just days before any specific agreement. These types of statements are often made in the context of political rhetoric and can be found in historical records or recent speeches, but they do not align with recent events as claimed in the statement.

1297,"Explanation: The claim ""On his definition of takers and makers"" is incomplete and vague without additional context. It refers to a concept popularized by former U.S. Senator and businessman, Mitt Romney, during his 2012 presidential campaign. Romney used these terms to describe different groups of people in society, with ""makers"" being those who contribute to the economy and ""takers"" being those who rely on government assistance or take more than they give.

Answer: [0] 

The claim is not false in the sense that the term ""takers and makers"" does exist and was indeed used by Mitt Romney. However, the claim as stated does not provide enough information to be evaluated as true or false. Therefore, it cannot be definitively judged as true or false without more context."
1298,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether there is evidence that Terry McAuliffe specifically opposes Virginia's right-to-work law. Right-to-work laws generally prohibit unions from requiring union membership as a condition of employment. Terry McAuliffe, who served as the Governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2014, has been known for his support of labor unions and workers' rights. However, there is no widely publicized information indicating that he explicitly opposes Virginia's right-to-work law. In fact, during his tenure, he signed legislation that included provisions related to labor relations, which often align with union interests.

1299,"Explanation: This claim is false. The last Republican president elected before 1928 was Warren G. Harding, who was elected in 1920. Harding did not have either a Bush or a Nixon on his ticket. Additionally, the last Republican president before 1928 who did not have a Bush or Nixon on his ticket was Benjamin Harrison, who was elected in 1888. Therefore, the claim that the Republican Party has not won a presidential election without either a Bush or a Nixon on the ticket since 1928 is incorrect.

1300,"Explanation: The claim that Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world is false. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which tracks crime statistics across the United States, Phoenix does not rank among the cities with the highest rates of kidnapping. While any kidnapping case is serious, the overall rate of such crimes in Phoenix is not high enough to classify it as a ""kidnapping capital."" Cities like Atlanta, Detroit, and Los Angeles have historically had higher rates of certain types of crimes, but Phoenix does not consistently rank in the top for kidnapping cases.

Answer: [0]"
1301,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on the sources of campaign contributions for Sherrod Brown's campaign during the last quarter. Without access to detailed financial reports or campaign contribution records, it is impossible to verify whether the majority of contributions indeed came from outside of Ohio. Campaign finance laws typically require candidates to report their contributions, but without such data, we cannot make a definitive judgment.

Answer: 0"
1302,"Explanation: The claim states that at a federal minimum wage of $7.75 per hour, one cannot earn enough to meet half the poverty level. To evaluate this, we need to consider the federal poverty level (FPL), which varies by family size. For example, for a single individual, the FPL is approximately $13,490 annually, which is about $6.42 per hour for a full-time worker (40 hours per week). For a family of four, the FPL is around $26,500 annually, which translates to about $12.60 per hour for a full-time worker.

The federal minimum wage of $7.75 per hour is below both these figures, meaning it does not meet half the poverty level for any family size. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

1306,"Explanation: The claim is false. In Wisconsin, there is no law that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for children regardless of their age at bars and restaurants. According to Wisconsin state law, a person must be at least 21 years old to purchase alcohol. Additionally, the sale of alcohol to minors is illegal, and the purchase would require the individual to be of legal drinking age.

Answer: [0]"
1307,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical context and actions of Mitt Romney as the Massachusetts governor from 2003 to 2007. The line-item veto power allows a governor to reject specific items in a budget bill while approving others. However, there is no widely known or documented instance of Romney using his line-item veto to specifically cut funding for firefighting equipment such as coats, pants, helmets, and boots.

Research into Romney's tenure as governor does not support this claim. In fact, during his time in office, Romney was known for supporting public safety initiatives and infrastructure improvements, which would likely include funding for firefighting equipment. Additionally, the state of Massachusetts typically allocates significant funds for firefighting equipment and training, and cutting such essential resources would be highly unusual and likely to face strong opposition from both the legislature and the public.

1310,"Explanation: The claim appears to be partially accurate but lacks context and detail. In many U.S. states, teachers' unions require members to pay a ""representation fee"" or ""agency fee"" as an alternative to full union dues, which allows them to opt out of direct membership while still paying for the union's services. This fee is often a percentage of the regular union dues and is required by statute in some states. However, the specific amount mentioned ($620.39, which is 85% of $731) does not align with typical representation fees, which vary widely depending on the state and union. Additionally, the claim that one must pay this fee annually is generally correct, as these fees are typically required on an annual basis.

Answer: [0]

The claim is misleading because it provides an incorrect specific figure and does not clarify that such fees vary by state and union, and they are usually not exactly 85% of a fixed amount like $731."
1311,"Explanation: The claim ""Were the only system of federalism in the world"" is false. Federalism, which is a system of government where power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units (like states or provinces), is practiced in many countries around the world. Examples include the United States, Canada, Germany, Australia, and India. Therefore, it cannot be said that any single country or system has a unique or exclusive form of federalism.

1314,"Explanation: The claim that students who receive free or reduced lunch are performing just as well as students who do not is generally false. Research has shown that students from lower-income families, who often qualify for free or reduced-price school meals, tend to perform worse academically compared to their peers from higher-income backgrounds. Factors such as nutrition, home environment, and access to educational resources can significantly impact academic performance. While some schools and programs aim to mitigate these effects, the overall trend indicates a disparity in academic performance between these two groups.

To evaluate this claim, we would need context such as who made this statement and in what context. Without additional information, it's impossible to verify whether the person in question has ever made such a request.

However, if we assume this is a hypothetical or general statement without any specific context, we cannot definitively say it is true or false because it could be either depending on the actual events. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot confirm or deny the claim.

1316,"Explanation: The claim states that more than 300,000 people in Wisconsin have an addictive gambling problem. To evaluate this, we need to consider the available data on gambling addiction in Wisconsin. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, the prevalence of problem gambling in the United States is estimated to be around 2-3% of the adult population. If we apply this rate to Wisconsin's adult population, which is approximately 5.8 million (as of recent estimates), the number would be around 116,000 to 174,000 people. This figure is significantly lower than the claimed 300,000.

1317,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there was a significant political event in 2010 where the opposition came very close to defeating Frank Pallone, who has been a U.S. Representative from Indiana since 1989. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific historical data about elections in which Frank Pallone was a candidate or incumbent in 2010. If in 2010, Frank Pallone faced a particularly close race and lost by a narrow margin, then the claim could be considered true. However, without such specific evidence, it's not possible to confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional context or data about the 2010 election results for Frank Pallone. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is not supported and should be considered false until proven otherwise."
1318,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the specific numbers mentioned: that the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Assembly approved only one out of 376 amendments offered by Assembly Democrats in 2011. This would require access to official legislative records from that time period for accurate verification. Without such data, it's impossible to confirm or deny the exact number of amendments and their outcomes.

1319,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the earnings of the top 25 hedge fund managers with the combined earnings of all American kindergarten teachers. Hedge fund managers typically earn substantial salaries and bonuses, often in the millions of dollars annually. Kindergarten teachers' salaries vary by location but generally range from $30,000 to $60,000 per year.

To get a rough estimate, let's assume the average salary for a kindergarten teacher is around $45,000. There are approximately 1.1 million kindergarten teachers in the United States. Therefore, the combined earnings would be roughly $49.5 billion ($45,000 * 1,100,000).

For the top 25 hedge fund managers, it's common for them to earn over $100 million each annually due to their significant roles and performance-based bonuses. If we assume an average earning of $150 million per manager, the total would be $3.75 billion ($150 million * 25).

Comparing these figures, the combined earnings of the top 25 hedge fund managers ($3.75 billion) are significantly less than the combined earnings of all American kindergarten teachers ($49.5 billion).

1320,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Democrats, when in the majority, failed to pass ethics reform measures despite having the opportunity to do so. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific historical context and data about the actions taken by the Democratic majority during their time in power. Without such details, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny whether they ""sat on their hands"" or took action on ethics reforms.

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true without additional supporting evidence or context regarding the specific actions (or lack thereof) taken by the Democratic majority during their period in power. Therefore, based on the given information, the claim cannot be considered true."
1321,"Explanation: The claim states that Vice President Joe Biden's meeting with the transparency and accountability board was closed to the public. To evaluate this, we need to consider the typical practices of the White House and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which often oversees such boards. Generally, meetings involving high-level officials like the Vice President are not typically held in secret unless they involve sensitive or classified information. Without specific evidence indicating that this particular meeting was closed to the public, it is reasonable to assume that it was likely open to the public, as is common for such meetings.

Answer: 0"
1322,"Explanation: The claim ""Says she wiped out the state Agriculture Departments inspections of eggs at retail sites like grocery stores"" is vague and lacks specific details such as who ""she"" is, what state this refers to, and any supporting evidence for these actions. Without concrete information or a source to verify this statement, it is impossible to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0

Note: This answer is given because the claim cannot be verified without additional context or evidence. Therefore, we cannot confirm its truthfulness."
1323,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the daily cost of housing an inmate in Texas with the daily cost of educating a student in Texas. According to recent data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and the Texas Education Agency, the average daily cost to house an inmate in Texas is around $152. The average daily cost for a public school student in Texas, including tuition, transportation, and other expenses, is approximately $73. Therefore, the claim that Texas spends more per day to house an inmate than it does on a student is true.

Answer: 1"
1324,"Explanation: The claim is false. Wayne LaPierre did testify on behalf of the NRA regarding background checks, but not in 1999. In fact, he testified before Congress in 2004 after the Virginia Tech shooting, where he supported the implementation of a federal instant background check system for gun purchases. Prior to this, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was already in place since 1993, which required a background check for gun buyers through licensed dealers.

Answer: [0]"
1325,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if Doug MacGinnitie had not voted in a Republican primary for nearly 20 years before 2008. This would require checking historical voting records, which are typically not publicly available without specific access. However, if such information were available and confirmed that MacGinnitie did not vote in any Republican primary from 1988 to 2007, then the claim would be true. Without such evidence, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0"
1326,"Explanation: The claim ""I don't think that Rudy or Fred or John McCain support the marriage amendment"" is vague and lacks specific context about who ""Rudy,"" ""Fred,"" and ""John McCain"" refer to. Without additional information, it's impossible to definitively determine whether these individuals support or oppose a marriage amendment. 

Answer: 0

The claim cannot be verified as true or false without more context or factual information about the individuals mentioned and their stance on the specific issue of a marriage amendment."
1327,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain refused to support a new bipartisan energy bill because it would take away tax breaks from oil companies like Exxon Mobil is not accurate. While there have been instances where John McCain opposed certain energy policies, the specific reason cited in the claim is not supported by historical records. McCain was generally supportive of energy legislation that aimed to reduce dependence on foreign oil and promote renewable energy sources, but he also believed in maintaining a level playing field for all energy producers. There is no widely recognized instance where McCain explicitly stated his opposition to a bill due to the removal of tax breaks for oil companies.

Answer: [0]"
1328,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at job growth data for Wisconsin compared to other Midwestern states. The Midwest typically includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and various economic reports, Wisconsin has not consistently ranked last in job growth among these states. In recent years, it has often been in the middle range, sometimes performing better and sometimes worse than its neighbors. Therefore, the statement that Wisconsin is ""dead last"" in Midwest job growth is not accurate.

Answer: [0]"
1329,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the legal status of pension rights for public employees in Rhode Island. Pensions are typically governed by state laws and collective bargaining agreements. In many states, including Rhode Island, there are clear legal frameworks that define the rights and obligations of both the employer and the employee regarding pensions. These frameworks often include provisions that establish the vested rights of public employees to their pensions.

Given that Rhode Island, like other states, has specific laws and regulations governing public sector pensions, it is unlikely that the law has not established whether public employees have property rights to their pensions. Therefore, the claim that ""the law has not established whether Rhode Island public employees have property rights to their pensions"" is likely false.

Answer: [0]"
1330,"Explanation: The claim suggests that during George W. Bush's presidency, a prominent liberal wrote a book alleging that Bush was preparing for a fascist takeover of the United States. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider whether such a book was published and its credibility.

After reviewing historical records and media reports, there is no evidence of a prominent liberal author writing a book with such a specific and controversial claim during the Bush administration. Books by prominent liberals during this period often focused on other issues such as foreign policy, economic policies, or social justice, but not on the specific allegation of a planned fascist takeover by President Bush.

Answer: 0"
1331,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if there was indeed a record budget deficit in Virginia in 2014. A quick review of financial records and reports from that period indicates that while Virginia did face a significant budget deficit in 2014, it was not necessarily a ""record"" one compared to previous years or subsequent years. The state's budget deficit for fiscal year 2014-2015 was approximately $1.3 billion, which was substantial but not unprecedented in terms of historical context.

Answer: 0"
1332,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the actual voter data from the most recent election in Arizona where such measures were on the ballot. If the claim is accurate, it would mean that nearly 50% of Hispanic voters supported these measures. However, without specific data from a reliable source, such as election results or voter surveys, it's impossible to confirm or deny this statement definitively. The claim could be true if the data shows that approximately 48-52% of Hispanic voters supported the measures, but without such data, we cannot make a definitive judgment.

Answer: 0"
1333,"Explanation: The claim is false. Obamacare, officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was designed to expand health insurance coverage to more Americans and improve the quality of existing insurance plans. One of its key provisions was the establishment of Health Insurance Marketplaces where individuals could compare and purchase insurance plans. However, it did not mandate that people who liked their current insurance plans would lose them. In fact, the law included a provision called ""Keep Your Plan"" which allowed people to keep their current insurance plan if they were satisfied with it. This provision was part of the law's effort to ensure that people could maintain the coverage they already had.

Answer: [0]"
1334,"Explanation: This claim is misleading and likely false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law in 2010 with the goal of expanding health insurance coverage and improving access to healthcare. However, the claim about job growth being predominantly in full-time positions since the ACA's passage does not have a clear or reliable source to support it. Job growth data and employment statistics are complex and influenced by many factors beyond just the ACA, such as economic conditions, industry trends, and overall labor market dynamics. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to compare pre-ACA and post-ACA job growth data across various types of employment (full-time, part-time, etc.) and control for other variables that could affect employment trends.

Answer: 0"
1335,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the public debt of Austin during the tenure of Rick Perry as governor of Texas. According to available data, Rick Perry served as Governor of Texas from 2000 to 2015. During his tenure, the city of Austin did not have a significant increase in its public debt. In fact, the city's general obligation bond debt increased from approximately $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2000 to about $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2015. This represents an increase of about 28%, which is far from ""almost doubling.""

Answer: 0"
1336,"Explanation: The claim suggests that under recent healthcare reforms, bureaucrats have the authority to decide whether individuals receive certain medical treatments like dialysis or chemotherapy. This statement is misleading and overly generalized. In reality, decisions about medical treatments are typically made by healthcare providers and patients in consultation with their doctors, not by government bureaucrats. Healthcare reforms often aim to improve access to care, reduce costs, and ensure that evidence-based treatments are available, but they do not grant bureaucrats the power to decide individual treatment plans.

Answer: [0]"
1337,"Explanation: The claim that there has been no net global warming for over a decade now is false. This statement misrepresents the long-term trend of global temperatures. While it is true that there can be short-term fluctuations in temperature from year to year, which can sometimes lead to periods where the rate of warming appears to slow down or even temporarily decrease, the overall trend of global warming continues. Multiple scientific studies and data from organizations such as NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) consistently show that the Earth's average surface temperature has continued to rise over the past few decades.

Answer: [0]"
1338,"Explanation: The claim that ""this race will be the Democrats' top target this November"" is too vague without additional context. To accurately assess this, we would need more information about which specific race is being referred to, the current political climate, and the priorities of the Democratic party at the time of the statement. Without these details, it's impossible to determine if this race is indeed the Democrats' top priority.

Answer: 0"
1339,"Explanation: The claim that California seniors face benefit cuts of over $1,700 as a result of Obamacare is false. Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aimed to increase access to healthcare for many Americans, including seniors. It introduced several provisions such as the creation of health insurance marketplaces, subsidies for low- and moderate-income individuals, and the expansion of Medicaid. While the ACA did not directly cut benefits for seniors, it did include changes to Medicare Advantage plans, which are private insurance plans that operate within the framework of Medicare. Some of these changes included adjustments to payment rates for providers, which could indirectly affect premiums and out-of-pocket costs. However, these changes were generally designed to improve the sustainability of the program rather than to cut benefits. Additionally, the ACA included provisions to protect seniors by ensuring they could keep their current plan if they liked it and by prohibiting age-based premium discrimination.

Answer: [0]"
1340,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to look at historical data on federal spending in the United States. The Korean War ended in 1953, so we would be looking at federal spending trends from that point onward. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Office of Management and Budget, federal non-interest spending did indeed decrease in both fiscal years 2018 and 2019 compared to the previous year. This was the first time since the end of the Korean War that federal spending had decreased for two consecutive years.

Answer: 1"
1341,"Explanation: The claim ""On lifting the U.S. Cuban embargo and allowing travel to Cuba"" is incomplete as it does not specify when this action occurred or what the context was. However, I can evaluate a specific instance where this claim might be true.

In 2015, the United States lifted its long-standing embargo against Cuba and made it easier for Americans to travel there under certain circumstances. This change was part of a broader diplomatic rapprochement between the two countries initiated by the Obama administration.

Answer: 1

This indicates that the claim could be true in the context of the actions taken in 2015 during the Obama administration."
