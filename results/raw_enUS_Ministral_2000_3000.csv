Answer: 0"
1,"Explanation: The claim is false. Waterboarding was not considered torture by the United States when it was used on Philippine insurgents during the Philippine-American War (1899-1902). The U.S. military used waterboarding as an interrogation technique during this period, and it was not considered torture at the time. The U.S. military's use of waterboarding was not widely publicized or condemned until the early 2000s, when it became a contentious issue in the context of the War on Terror.

Answer: 0"
2,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific political stance on drilling in Alaska.

3,"Explanation: The claim that HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin is not accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the overall rate of HIV/AIDS in Austin is relatively stable, and there is no evidence to suggest a significant increase specifically among women.

Answer: 1"
5,"Explanation: The claim that the conviction rate is almost exactly the same for whites and blacks who commit murder is not accurate. Studies have shown that there are significant racial disparities in the criminal justice system, including in murder cases. Black defendants are more likely to be convicted and sentenced to longer prison terms than white defendants for similar crimes. This disparity is often attributed to a combination of factors, including implicit bias, differential treatment by law enforcement, and disparities in plea bargaining.

Answer: 0"

There are multiple news stations and outlets that cover New Jersey government, including but not limited to, NJ.com, The Star-Ledger, and other local news stations such as WABC-TV and WPIX.

Answer: 0"
7,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, requires members of Congress to abide by the same rules as other Americans. This includes the requirement to purchase health insurance through the federal health insurance marketplace. However, members of Congress have the option to choose a plan from the federal marketplace or a plan from their state's marketplace. They also have the option to purchase a plan from the federal marketplace that is subsidized by the government. This is similar to the subsidies available to other Americans who purchase plans through the federal marketplace.

Answer: 1"
8,"Explanation: The claim that a person took credit for reining in state spending when they were governor is a factual statement that can be verified by checking the person's official statements, speeches, or records of their time in office.

The 117th Congress, which began in January 2021, is the most diverse in U.S. history, with a record number of women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals serving in the House of Representatives. This diversity includes the first Native American woman, the first Muslim woman, and the first openly LGBTQ+ person of color to serve in Congress.

Answer: 1"
10,"Explanation: The claim is a mixture of true and false statements. Let's break it down:

1. **Business Income Tax**: Sen. Steve Ogden has been a vocal opponent of the business income tax, but he was not the driving force behind it. The tax was implemented as part of a broader tax reform package.

2. **Robin Hood School Finance Scheme**: This is a reference to a school finance reform bill that Sen. Ogden supported. The bill aimed to redistribute property tax revenue to schools in need, but it did not necessarily result in property taxes skyrocketing.

3. **$14 billion deficit**: The claim about a $14 billion deficit is not accurate. The state's budget deficit is not that large.

4. **Voted against gun freedoms**: Sen. Ogden has voted against certain gun control measures, but the claim that he voted against ""gun freedoms"" is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
11,"Explanation: The claim that George Washington, the first president of the United States, prayed every day and had a field manual of prayers is false. While it is true that Washington was a religious man and attended church regularly, there is no historical evidence to support the claim that he prayed every day or had a specific field manual of prayers. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of Washington's religious practices.

Answer: 0"
13,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific time frame (the past year) and a specific comparison (almost every other state in the country). To verify this claim, I would need to check the latest job creation data for Ohio and compare it with other states. However, without specific data, it's challenging to confirm the claim's accuracy. Typically, job creation data is available from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics or state-specific economic reports.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be confirmed as true without specific data.)"
14,"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Bob McDonnel's budget does not take money out of classrooms to pave roads. The claim is a misinterpretation of budget allocations. The budget typically allocates funds to various departments, including education and infrastructure, based on the needs and priorities of the state. The claim suggests a direct transfer of funds from education to road paving, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
15,"Explanation: The claim that a nation is the ""highest taxed nation in the world"" can be evaluated by looking at various sources such as the OECD's Revenue Statistics database, which provides data on tax revenues as a percentage of GDP. As of the latest available data, the highest taxed nation in the world is typically Sweden, with a tax-to-GDP ratio of around 45%. Therefore, the claim that a specific nation is the highest taxed nation in the world would need to be supported by specific data and context.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it does not specify which nation is being referred to and the highest taxed nation is typically Sweden.)"
16,"Explanation: The claim that Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America is false. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, as of 2021, California has the highest number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, with Texas ranking second. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
17,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Scott has heavily invested in a company that is geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to family and friends out of the country is false.

Answer: 0"
18,"Explanation: The claim that Sandy Pasch voted to cut school aid by nearly $300 million is false. According to the Wisconsin State Senate's voting records, Sandy Pasch did not vote to cut school aid by nearly $300 million.

Answer: 0"
19,"Explanation: The claim that ""more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock"" is based on a misinterpretation of data. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the percentage of births to unmarried mothers in the African-American community is around 70%, not more than 72%. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
20,"Explanation: The claim about the number of undocumented immigrants living in a specific state is not verifiable without additional context. The number of undocumented immigrants can vary greatly depending on the state and the source of the data. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false without more specific information.

Answer: 0/1"
21,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney received exactly zero votes in at least 12 Cuyahoga County precincts is false. While it is possible for a candidate to receive no votes in certain precincts, the claim specifies a minimum of 12 precincts, which is an exact number and not a general statement. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Romney received zero votes in exactly 12 precincts without specific evidence or data to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
22,"Explanation: The claim that ""the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time"" is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the majority of new jobs created in recent years have been full-time. In 2021, for example, the number of full-time jobs increased by 1.6 million, while part-time jobs increased by 1.1 million. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
23,"Explanation: The claim that a plan would cut taxes without increasing the deficit is a complex economic statement that depends on the specifics of the plan. Tax cuts can increase the deficit if they are not accompanied by corresponding spending cuts or revenue increases. Therefore, without specific details about the plan, it is not possible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
24,"Explanation: The claim that we have the third-lowest minimum wage of developed countries is not accurate. According to the OECD, the United States has the lowest minimum wage among developed countries. As of 2021, the U.S. federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, which is lower than many other developed countries. Therefore, the claim that we have the third-lowest minimum wage is false.

Answer: 0"
25,"Explanation: The claim is false. While President Obama did support access to reproductive health care, including abortion, he did not explicitly state that abortion would be at the heart of his health care reform plan. His stance on abortion was more nuanced and focused on reducing unintended pregnancies and improving access to contraception, rather than making abortion a central component of his health care reform.

Answer: 0"
26,"Explanation: The claim states that the library district would come at no direct cost to the city budget. This claim is true because the library district is a separate entity from the city, and its funding is typically managed through a separate taxing district. The city would not be directly responsible for the library district's budget.

Answer: 1"
27,"Explanation: Kendrick Meek, a former U.S. Representative from Florida, did indeed express support for Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court. However, he was not the only candidate to do so. Many other candidates and political figures also expressed support for Sotomayor's nomination. Therefore, the claim that Meek is the only candidate who said Sotomayor will make an excellent Supreme Court justice is false.

Answer: 0"
28,"Explanation: The claim states that the unemployment rate in a specific state is the fifth-highest in the country, higher than the nationwide rate, and higher than all neighboring states. To verify this claim, we would need to check the latest unemployment rates for the specific state and its neighboring states, as well as the nationwide rate. Without specific data, it's impossible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without specific data.)"
29,"Explanation: The claim that the Obama-Clinton administration's policies on coal have cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs is a simplification and an exaggeration. While it is true that the Clean Power Plan, a key policy of the Obama administration, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, including those that burn coal, the impact on jobs was not as straightforward as the claim suggests. The Clean Power Plan was designed to promote cleaner energy sources and reduce the environmental impact of coal, but it also aimed to create new jobs in renewable energy sectors. Additionally, the claim does not account for the broader economic factors that contribute to job losses in any industry. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
30,"Explanation: The claim about 350,000 people succeeding in crossing borders illegally each year is not accurate. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in the fiscal year 2021 was approximately 1.7 million. This figure includes both successful and unsuccessful attempts to cross the border illegally. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and not based on accurate data.

Answer: 0"
31,"Explanation: The claim is referring to a specific legal case involving Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. As of my last update in October 2023, there have been no convictions directly connected to an allegation that Governor Walker is at the center of a criminal scheme. The claim is based on a specific legal case that is ongoing and has not yet resulted in convictions.

Answer: 0"
32,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is called the Badger State because our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining is false. The term ""Badger State"" is actually a reference to the badger, a type of animal that is native to Wisconsin. The name was given to the state in the 1850s, and it has nothing to do with mining or the American dream.

Answer: 0"
33,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in 2019. According to the NAEP report, 86% of African-American boys and 82% of Hispanic boys in 4th grade were not reading at or above the proficiency level.

Answer: 0"
35,"Explanation: Texas has historically been the state with the highest number of executions in the United States. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, as of 2021, Texas has executed more people than any other state since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. Therefore, the claim that Texas ranks first in executions among the states is true.

Answer: 1"
36,"Explanation: The claim that tax rates were significantly higher ""in the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s"" is true. During these decades, the top marginal income tax rate in the United States was significantly higher than it is today. For example, in 1944, the top marginal income tax rate was 94%, and it remained high throughout the 1950s and 1960s, peaking at 91% in 1952 and 1953.

38,"Explanation: The claim is true. In 2016, several risk analysts and financial institutions, including the World Economic Forum and the International Monetary Fund, listed a Donald Trump presidency as a significant risk to the global economy. This was due to concerns about his policies, including trade tariffs, immigration restrictions, and potential market volatility. The claim is supported by credible sources and historical context.

Answer: 1"
39,"Explanation: The claim is based on data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2007, the top 1 percent of income earners in the United States did indeed make 23.5 percent of all income, while the bottom 50 percent made 12.5 percent. This data is accurate and has been widely reported and verified by various sources.

Answer: 1"
40,"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was a U.S. policy that prohibited military personnel from discussing their sexual orientation and required them to keep their sexual orientation secret. The policy was repealed in 2011. The claim that more than 12,500 service members were discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the policy was implemented is not accurate. The actual number of discharges under the policy was much lower. Additionally, the claim that the discharges cost over $360 million is also not accurate. The cost of discharges due to the policy was not that high.

Answer: 0"
41,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""Of the 13 (Bill) Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state"" is incorrect. Bill Clinton's speeches have been well-documented, and it is known that he gave speeches for high fees even after his wife, Hillary Clinton, became Secretary of State. The claim misrepresents the timeline and the number of speeches.

Answer: 0"
42,"Explanation: The claim about the reserves being in much better shape than they were just a few years ago is subjective and depends on the specific context and metrics used to measure reserves. Without specific data or context, it's difficult to definitively judge the truth of this claim. However, if we consider general economic indicators and reports from reputable sources, it's possible that reserves could have improved in certain aspects, such as foreign exchange reserves or natural resource reserves.

Answer: 1/0 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
43,"Explanation: The claim is true. In the United States, many states allow voters to cast their ballots before Election Day through early voting or absentee voting. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 32 states and Washington D.C. offer some form of early voting or absentee voting. This allows voters to avoid long lines and potential wait times on Election Day.

Answer: 1"
44,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the response to a major snow event in Atlanta to the response to a major earthquake in Kansas City, Mo. This is a false comparison because snow events and earthquakes are fundamentally different types of natural disasters. Snow events are predictable and can be prepared for, while earthquakes are sudden and unpredictable. The response to each type of event would be vastly different, with snow events requiring snow removal and road clearing, while earthquakes require immediate safety measures and structural assessments. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
45,"Explanation: Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani was indeed sentenced to stoning in Iran. She was convicted of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning in 2006. However, her sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. The claim that she was never sentenced to stoning is false.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0/1"
48,"Explanation: The claim states that New Jersey opened offices in Shanghai and London in the past six months and has seen an 18 percent increase in exports. However, there is no credible source provided to verify these claims. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time frame for the 18 percent increase in exports, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
49,"Explanation: Chris Christie, who served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018, did not make a specific promise to avoid school cuts during his gubernatorial campaign.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
51,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""he didnt call Dr. George Tiller a baby killer"" is a direct denial of the accusation made by liberal groups. The claimant is essentially admitting that he did not personally use the term ""baby killer"" to describe Dr. Tiller, but he did report that some pro-life groups branded him with that term. This does not negate the fact that the claimant was reporting the use of the term by others, which is still a form of association with the term.

Answer: 0"
52,"Explanation: The claim that the GOP had no discussions with Democrats in preparing a rules package for the 112th Congress is false. In reality, bipartisan discussions and negotiations are common in the legislative process, including the preparation of rules packages.

Answer: 0"
53,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has the most number of deductions available to corporations for the corporate income tax is not accurate. While the U.S. does have a complex tax code with numerous deductions, it is not the country with the most deductions. Many other countries, such as those in Europe and Asia, have more extensive tax deduction systems for corporations. For example, countries like Germany and Japan have more generous tax incentives and deductions for businesses.

Answer: 0"
54,"Explanation: The claim is false. UPS has not left 15,000 employees' spouses without health insurance. In 2019, UPS announced that it would end its health insurance coverage for spouses of employees who work less than 30 hours per week. However, this change only affected a small number of employees, not 15,000. Additionally, UPS did not tell these employees to go on an exchange without an employer subsidy. The company has been providing health insurance to its employees and their spouses for many years.

Answer: 0"
55,"Explanation: The claim states that there have been 59 roadway fatalities in Georgia this year. To verify this, I would need to check reliable sources such as the Georgia Department of Transportation, the Georgia State Patrol, or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

58,"Explanation: The claim that Medicare spends ""$15-billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies"" is false. Medicare does not provide subsidies to insurance companies.

Answer: 0"
59,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 111th Congress, which was led by Democrats, did not spend more money in two years than the first 100 Congresses combined. The 111th Congress, which ran from 2009 to 2011, had a total spending of approximately $3.8 trillion. In contrast, the first 100 Congresses, which ran from 1789 to 1991, had a total spending of approximately $1.5 trillion. Therefore, the 111th Congress did not spend more money than the first 100 Congresses combined.

Answer: 0"
60,"Explanation: The claim that 29 states no longer have a death tax due to the tax damaging their economic competitiveness is not accurate. The primary reason for the repeal of the death tax in many states is not economic competitiveness but rather political and ideological reasons. Many states have repealed the death tax due to pressure from conservative groups and politicians who argue that the tax is unfair and should be eliminated. The economic impact of the death tax is not the primary factor driving its repeal.

Answer: 0"
61,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire during the terrorist attack in Benghazi is false. The timeline of events during the Benghazi attack has been extensively investigated, and it is widely accepted that the U.S. government, including the State Department, responded to the situation as quickly as possible under the circumstances. The claim of a 13-hour delay is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
62,"Explanation: The claim that ""Thirty U.S. cities have Triple A baseball teams and virtually everyone of them [is] playing in government-owned ballparks"" is false. There are indeed 30 teams in the Triple-A baseball league, but not all of them play in government-owned ballparks. Many teams play in privately-owned stadiums or facilities. For example, the Charlotte Knights play at Truist Field, which is privately owned, and the Durham Bulls play at the Durham Bulls Athletic Park, which is also privately owned. Therefore, the claim that ""virtually everyone"" plays in government-owned ballparks is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
63,"Explanation: The claim is made by Bill Clinton, who served as the Governor of Arkansas from 1983 to 1992. He led several initiatives to improve education in Arkansas during his tenure, including the creation of the Arkansas School for the Deaf and the Arkansas School for the Blind. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
64,"Explanation: The claim that income levels and unemployment numbers are worse now than just about ever for African-Americans under President Barack Obama is not accurate. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for African-Americans was at its lowest point in 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, income levels for African-Americans have been increasing, although the gap with white Americans remains significant. The claim seems to be based on a misunderstanding of recent economic trends and data.

Answer: 0"
65,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific action taken by the speaker regarding a lawsuit.

Answer: 0/1"
66,"Explanation: The claim that ""no new jobs"" were created in the year since the Republican Party (GOP) took control of the House of Representatives is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy added 6.6 million jobs in 2021, the first full year of the Biden administration. This figure includes jobs created under the previous administration, but it is clear that job growth continued after the GOP took control of the House.

Answer: 0"
67,"Explanation: The claim is false. Patrick Gaspard served as the political director for the White House under President Obama, but there is no evidence to suggest that he was the ""right-hand man"" for Bertha Lewis, who heads up ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now). The two individuals are not known to have had a direct professional relationship.

Answer: 0"
68,"Explanation: Education Week is a well-known publication that annually ranks schools across the United States. However, the claim that Ohio schools are in the top five in the nation is not accurate. While Ohio schools may perform well in certain categories, there is no consistent ranking that places Ohio schools in the top five overall. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of Education Week's rankings.

Answer: 0"
69,"Explanation: The claim about $277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin being included in a federal spending bill is false.

Lee Fisher, a former Ohio Secretary of State and current U.S. Senator from Ohio, has publicly expressed support for certain gun control measures, but he has also been critical of some aspects of gun control legislation. There is no verified quote from him stating that he has never met a gun control bill he didn't like.

Campaign finance reports are publicly available and can be verified through sources like the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in the United States. Without specific data to back up the claim, it is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
76,"Explanation: The claim that Hawaii ""doesn't have a history of throwing incumbents out of office"" is false. Hawaii has a history of electing new representatives and senators, and there have been instances where incumbents have been defeated.

Additionally, in the 2020 elections, several incumbents were defeated in Hawaii's congressional races.

The state has implemented several measures to protect consumers, including a cap on the number of payday loans a borrower can take out in a year, a requirement for lenders to verify a borrower's income and ability to repay the loan, and a prohibition on rollover loans. These regulations are designed to prevent predatory lending practices and ensure that borrowers are not taken advantage of.

Without specific data or sources to back up this claim, it is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
84,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""we created as many jobs in the first six months of this year as we did in all of 2011"" is incorrect. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the U.S. added 2.5 million jobs in the first six months of 2021, while in 2011, the U.S. added 2.6 million jobs. Additionally, the claim that ""2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000"" is also incorrect. The BLS data shows that 2014 had the highest private-sector job growth since 2000, with 2.9 million jobs added.

Answer: 0"
85,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every poll you see, the overwhelming majority of people want [E-Verify]"" is a generalization that is not accurate. While there may be polls that show a majority of people supporting E-Verify, it is not accurate to say that every poll shows this. Poll results can vary significantly depending on the specific questions asked, the sample size, and the methodology used. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that ""every poll"" shows overwhelming support for E-Verify.

For example, in some states, the annual cost of operating the governor's mansion can be in the range of $500,000 to $1 million or more.

87,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump supports eminent domain and the Supreme Court's Kelo decision is false.

The claim is vague and lacks specific details, making it difficult to verify its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
90,"Explanation: The claim that seventy percent of the people living in abject poverty are women is not accurate. While it is true that women are disproportionately affected by poverty, the percentage is not seventy percent.

However, the claim that seventy percent of the people living in abject poverty are women is an exaggeration.

94,"Explanation: The claim that Governor Scott Walker took away $1.6 billion from schools and handed it off as over $2 billion in tax breaks to the rich is a simplification and misrepresentation of the actual policies and their impacts. The $1.6 billion figure is a result of Walker's budget cuts, which included reductions in education funding. However, the $2 billion figure for tax breaks is an exaggeration. Walker's tax policies did include cuts and reforms, but the total amount of tax breaks provided was not $2 billion. The claim also implies a direct transfer of funds from schools to the wealthy, which is not accurate. The budget cuts and tax policies were part of a broader economic strategy that had various impacts on different sectors of the economy.

Answer: 0"
95,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government can cut all of the non-military discretionary spending and not balance the budget is false. Non-military discretionary spending includes programs like education, healthcare, and social services. Cutting all of this spending would significantly impact the economy and the lives of many Americans. Additionally, the federal government's budget is influenced by many factors, including mandatory spending (like Social Security and Medicare) and revenue from taxes. Simply cutting discretionary spending does not guarantee a balanced budget.

Answer: 0"
96,"Explanation: The claim that people in Galveston, Texas, have been allowed to privatize part of their Social Security and are building wealth is false. Social Security is a federal program managed by the U.S. government, and there is no provision for individuals to privatize their benefits. The Social Security Administration does not allow individuals to opt out of the program or privatize their benefits. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that people in Galveston or elsewhere have been able to build wealth through privatizing their Social Security benefits.

99,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama had the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress is false. The U.S. Constitution grants the power to declare war to Congress, not the President. While the President has the authority to use military force in response to an imminent threat or in self-defense, he does not have the authority to initiate a war without congressional approval. In the case of the 2013 Syria strike, President Obama did not have the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress.

Answer: 0"
100,"Explanation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010, does not require a 20 percent down payment to buy a house. The law primarily focuses on financial regulations and consumer protection, but it does not set specific requirements for down payments on mortgages. The minimum down payment required for a mortgage is typically set by the lender or the type of loan, not by the Dodd-Frank Act.

Answer: 0"
101,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no publicly available record or database that tracks the voting records of politicians or public figures for organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) or the American Legion. These organizations do not publicly disclose the voting records of their members, and such information is not typically made available to the public. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the claim that the individual has a perfect voting record from these organizations.

Answer: 0"
102,"Explanation: Barack Obama, during his time as a U.S. Senator and later as President, has had a mixed record on criminal justice reform. While he has supported some measures to reduce penalties for non-violent offenders, he has also supported tougher penalties for certain crimes. For instance, he signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which included provisions for mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. Therefore, the claim that he has consistently voted against tougher penalties for criminals is false.

105,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Scott has destroyed over 100,000 jobs is a political statement that is often used to criticize his economic policies.

108,"Explanation: The claim that Texas gained 21,000 doctors due to tort reform is not accurate. While tort reform can potentially make the medical profession more attractive by reducing the risk of lawsuits, the specific number of 21,000 doctors gained due to tort reform is not supported by reliable data or studies. The claim appears to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the effects of tort reform on the medical workforce in Texas.

Answer: 0"
109,"Explanation: The claim that ""most private sector jobs in the history of Buffalo exist in Buffalo today"" is not accurate. While Buffalo has seen significant economic growth and development in recent years, it is not true that most private sector jobs from its history still exist today. Many jobs have been lost due to economic shifts, technological advancements, and other factors. Additionally, new jobs have been created in different sectors, which means the job market has evolved over time.

Answer: 0"

Alex Jones has made controversial and false statements about the Sandy Hook shooting, but the claim that he said the victims were child actors and no one was killed is a specific misrepresentation of his statements. Multiple independent investigations and reports have confirmed that the Sandy Hook shooting was a real event, and the victims were indeed children who were killed.

Answer: 0"
111,"Explanation: The claim that the majority of revenue generated by a proposed Kenosha casino would be sent to the Seminole tribe in Florida is false.

Answer: 0"
112,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that Texas has a large Latinx population, the state has indeed elected Latinas to Congress. For example, in 2020, Sylvia Garcia and Veronica Escobar were elected to represent Texas' 29th and 32nd congressional districts, respectively. Therefore, the claim that Texas has never elected a Latina to Congress is incorrect.

116,"Explanation: The claim that there are half a million fewer government employees now than when President Barack Obama took office is based on a comparison of the number of federal employees in 2009 and 2021. According to the Office of Personnel Management, the number of federal employees in January 2009 was approximately 2,094,000, while in January 2021, it was approximately 2,097,000. This means there are actually more federal employees now than when Obama took office, not fewer.

Answer: 0"
117,"Explanation: The Clean Power Plan is a regulation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been a critic of the Clean Power Plan and has proposed alternatives to address climate change. However, there is no evidence that Sen.

119,"Explanation: The claim is false. The proposed transportation tax plan does not revoke a tax-credit for consumers' electric cars.

122,"Explanation: The claim that one-third of the gasoline is purchased by out-of-state people in Virginia is not supported by any reliable data or sources.

Answer: 0"
123,"Explanation: The claim that the federal tax code has loopholes that are giving incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas is partially true. While there are certain tax provisions that can incentivize companies to move operations overseas, such as the Foreign Tax Credit, these provisions are not specifically designed to encourage job offshoring. The primary goal of these provisions is to prevent double taxation of foreign income. Additionally, the U.S. tax code includes provisions like the GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income) tax, which aims to discourage companies from shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Therefore, while there are tax incentives that can indirectly influence job offshoring, it is not accurate to say that the tax code has loopholes specifically designed to incentivize this practice.

1. **Data Source**: Check reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or the U.S. Census Bureau for the most recent job growth data.
2. **Comparison**: Compare Wisconsin's job growth rate with other Midwest states over the past year.
3. **Ranking**: Determine if Wisconsin indeed ranked third in job growth among Midwest states.

Since I don't have the specific data for the last year, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, if you can provide the specific data or sources, I can help you verify the claim.

126,"Explanation: The claim that FIFA pressured Brazil into passing a so-called Budweiser bill, allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums, is false.

Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that FIFA pressured Brazil to pass such a law.

Answer: 0"
127,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama put a stop sign against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska, is false. While President Obama did implement policies that restricted oil drilling and exploration in certain areas, such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf, he did not put a complete stop sign against all forms of oil drilling and exploration. His policies were part of a broader strategy to balance environmental concerns with energy production.

Answer: 0"
128,"Explanation: The claim that Jeb Bush ""flip-flop-flip(ped)"" on immigration is a reference to his changing positions on immigration policies over time. Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida and son of former President George H.W. Bush, has indeed shifted his stance on immigration. Initially, he supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but later shifted to a more restrictive stance. This change in position is often referred to as ""flip-flopping."" Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
129,"Explanation: The claim about suction entrapment incidents in swimming pools and spas, including 36 deaths of children, is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
131,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the overall crime decline in the United States is significantly influenced by the crime decline in New York City. While it is true that New York City has experienced a notable decrease in crime, it is not accurate to say that the national crime decline would be ""fairly small"" if it weren't for this. The United States has seen a general trend of crime decline over the past few decades, with many cities and states contributing to this trend. Therefore, the claim overstates the influence of New York City's crime decline on the national trend.

Answer: 0"
132,"Explanation: The claim that the Senate immigration bill would make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI, with one agent every 250 feet, is an exaggeration and not accurate. The bill, known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did propose an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents, but it did not specify a ratio that would make the Border Patrol larger than the FBI. The FBI has approximately 14,000 special agents, while the Border Patrol has around 20,000 agents. The claim of having one agent every 250 feet is a misrepresentation of the bill's provisions.

134,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama's proposal, known as the Clean Power Plan, aimed to reduce carbon emissions from power plants in the United States.

In fact, the Clean Power Plan was designed to reduce emissions globally by encouraging other countries to adopt similar policies. The claim misrepresents the purpose and impact of the Clean Power Plan.

Answer: 0"
135,"Explanation: The claim that a politician has never asked for a single earmark or pork barrel project for their state is difficult to verify without specific evidence. Earmarks are often requested by politicians for various reasons, and it's possible that the politician in question has indeed never requested any. However, without concrete evidence or a specific list of earmarks requested, it's impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0"
141,"Explanation: The claim states that Mike Huckabee, as governor of Arkansas, granted 1,033 pardons and commutations, which is more than the previous three governors combined. This claim is false because it is not supported by accurate historical data. According to the Arkansas Department of Corrections, Mike Huckabee granted 1,033 pardons and commutations during his term, but this number is not significantly more than the combined total of the previous three governors. The claim exaggerates the number of clemencies granted by Huckabee.

Answer: 0"
142,"Explanation: The claim that the proposed transportation bill could be the largest tax increase in Georgia history is difficult to verify without specific details about the bill and the tax increases it proposes.

143,"Explanation: The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as the stimulus bill, was designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs. While it did not immediately solve the unemployment crisis, it did create or save millions of jobs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the ARRA created or saved about 2.6 million jobs in 2010. Therefore, the claim that the 2009 stimulus bill failed to get people back to work is false.

Answer: 1"
145,"Explanation: The claim suggests that $125 billion can be saved by not giving out money to Medicare recipients who do not exist for procedures that did not happen. This claim is false because it oversimplifies the issue and ignores the complexities of fraud detection and prevention in healthcare systems. Medicare fraud is a serious issue, but the claim's suggestion that a significant portion of Medicare spending is fraudulent is not supported by evidence. The claim also implies that all non-existent recipients and procedures are fraudulent, which is not accurate. Medicare has systems in place to detect and prevent fraud, and the claim's figure of $125 billion is not based on reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
146,"Explanation: The claim that the University of Wisconsin System will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America because of a cap on tuition tied to inflation is not accurate. While the University of Wisconsin System has implemented a tuition freeze or a cap on tuition increases tied to inflation, this does not necessarily make it the most affordable campus in America. Affordability can vary greatly depending on factors such as state funding, scholarships, and financial aid available to students. Additionally, the claim that it will be ""much more affordable"" is subjective and not supported by specific data or comparisons with other institutions.

152,"Explanation: The claim that the nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone XL is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs is not accurate. The Keystone XL pipeline project was initially proposed in 2008 and faced numerous delays due to environmental concerns and regulatory processes. However, the actual impact on job creation is complex and varies depending on the source and methodology used. While some studies suggest that the pipeline could create jobs, others argue that the overall economic impact is minimal. The claim of 100,000 jobs lost due to the delay is not supported by credible evidence.

158,"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years is not verifiable without specific data or sources. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to refer to official employment statistics or reports from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Without such data, it is impossible to confirm the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0"
159,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Oregon's high minimum wage is the reason why restaurants employed fewer workers by 2011. However, correlation does not imply causation. The decrease in the number of employees could be due to various factors such as economic downturns, changes in consumer behavior, or other industry-specific trends. Without specific data showing a direct link between the minimum wage increase and the decrease in employment, the claim is not supported.

Answer: 0"
160,"Explanation: The claim is false. The current President of the United States, Joe Biden, has publicly stated his support for same-sex marriage. He has also signed an executive order that reverses a previous policy that restricted the rights of transgender individuals in the military. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that he agrees with the claim that marriage should be between a man and a woman.

Answer: 0"
161,"Explanation: The Climatic Research Unit (CRU) e-mails, often referred to as ""Climategate,"" were a series of hacked e-mails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. The e-mails were leaked in 2009 and sparked controversy, with some claiming they showed evidence of scientific misconduct or manipulation of data. However, multiple independent investigations, including those by the Royal Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and the U.S. House of Representatives, found no evidence of scientific misconduct or manipulation of data. The e-mails did not debunk the science behind climate change; they merely showed that scientists were engaged in normal scientific practices, such as discussing data and methods, and occasionally expressing frustration with the process of peer review and public communication. Therefore, the claim that the CRU e-mails show that the science behind climate change has been debunked is false.

Answer: 0"
162,"Explanation: The claim that PPS (Public Employees Retirement System) employees have paid their own PERS contributions for many years is false. PERS contributions are typically paid by both the employer and the employee. The employee's contribution is usually a percentage of their salary, while the employer's contribution is also a percentage of the employee's salary. This is a standard practice for public employee retirement systems to ensure that both parties contribute to the retirement fund.

Answer: 0"
163,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information or credible source that confirms Alex Sink's plans for governor include $12.5 billion in new spending. This claim appears to be a fabrication or misinterpretation of her campaign platform.

Answer: 0"
164,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, about 28% of uninsured individuals lived in households where at least one person was working. The claim states that 70% of uninsured individuals live in such households, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
165,"Explanation: The claim that Nevada ranks 50th in the money received from the stimulus bill is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's data, Nevada received the 10th highest amount of stimulus funds per capita among the states. The claim likely confuses Nevada's ranking in terms of total stimulus funds received with its ranking in terms of funds received per capita.

Answer: 0"
166,"Explanation: The claim that ""just about half of rural hospitals operate in the red in Virginia"" is difficult to verify without specific data or sources. However, it is known that rural hospitals often face financial challenges due to lower patient volumes, higher costs, and limited access to specialized care. Therefore, it is plausible that a significant number of rural hospitals in Virginia may operate at a loss. Without concrete data, it is challenging to definitively say whether exactly half of them are in the red.

Answer: 1"
167,"Explanation: The claim that the numbers of people who support Obamacare and like it have been steadily dropping is not accurate. According to various polls and surveys, public opinion on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has been relatively stable over time. While there have been fluctuations in support, the overall trend has not shown a steady decline. For instance, a 2021 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 56% of Americans approved of the Affordable Care Act, which is similar to the levels of support seen in previous years.

Answer: 0"
168,"Explanation: The claim is false. The region you represent, which is not specified, cannot have more automotive plants than the entire state of California. California is home to numerous automotive plants, including those of major manufacturers like Tesla, Toyota, and Honda. As of now, there are no regions that can claim to have more automotive plants than the entire state of California.

Answer: 0"
169,"Explanation: The claim is false. Redistricting plans are typically drawn by state legislatures and are subject to legal and political scrutiny. The claim that a specific individual, such as Nancy Nusbaum, was cut out of her state Senate district by a half a block is not a standard way to describe redistricting changes and lacks specific details that would allow for verification. Additionally, redistricting plans are usually announced and discussed publicly, and such a specific claim would likely have been reported by multiple sources if it were true.

Answer: 0"
170,"Explanation: The claim is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama was interviewed by American reporters in Asia, and they did ask him about Asia and the economy. For instance, in a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Obama discussed the economy and trade issues in Asia. Additionally, during his 2010 trip to India, he was asked about the economy and trade relations with Asia by American reporters.

Answer: 0"
171,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010, and Wisconsin's Senator at the time, Russ Feingold, voted against it. The claim that a majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care is not accurate, as the ACA was supported by a majority of Americans at the time of its passage. Therefore, the claim that Feingold voted for it anyway is also incorrect.

Answer: 0"
172,"Explanation: The claim is false. Former U.S. President Barack Obama did not choose to deny the anti-Semitic motivation of the attack on a kosher Jewish grocery in Paris. In fact, he publicly condemned the attack and acknowledged the anti-Semitic nature of it. He stated, ""The attack on the kosher grocery store in Paris was an attack on the Jewish community, and it was an attack on the values that we share."" This statement was made in a press conference following the attack.

Answer: 0"
173,"Explanation: The claim that gas prices have never been higher is true. As of my last update in October 2023, gas prices have reached record highs in many regions around the world. Additionally, Exxon Mobil's profits have also been high due to the increased demand for energy and the high prices of oil and gas. Therefore, the claim that Exxon Mobil's profits have never been higher is also true.

175,"Explanation: The claim states that the individual did not vote for tax increases as a member of the West Miami City Commission.

Without access to these records, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
176,"Explanation: Margaret Sanger, the birth control pioneer, was a controversial figure due to her views on eugenics. She believed in the idea of ""positive eugenics,"" which aimed to improve the human race by encouraging reproduction among those deemed ""fit"" and discouraging reproduction among those deemed ""unfit."" However, her views were not directed at eliminating specific groups of people, but rather at promoting the idea of selective reproduction. The claim that Sanger believed people like ""me"" should be eliminated is a misinterpretation of her views and is not supported by historical evidence.

Answer: 0"
177,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island was one of the first states in the union to pass a voter ID bill is false. While Rhode Island has implemented voter ID laws, it was not one of the first states to do so. The first state to pass a voter ID law was Georgia in 2005. Rhode Island's voter ID law was enacted in 2011.

Answer: 0"
178,"Explanation: The claim is comparing job creation during the Obama administration to the Reagan recovery. The Reagan recovery refers to the economic recovery that occurred during the 1980s, following the recession of 1980-1981. The claim suggests that Obama created more private-sector jobs in the past 27 months than Reagan did during his recovery period. However, the claim does not specify the exact time frame for the 27 months or the specific period of the Reagan recovery being compared. Without clear and specific data for both periods, it is not possible to accurately compare the job creation figures. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
179,"Explanation: The claim that states with the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates is not entirely accurate. While it is true that states with higher rates of gun ownership tend to have higher rates of gun-related suicides, this does not mean that gun ownership is the sole or primary factor contributing to suicide rates. Other factors such as mental health, socioeconomic conditions, and cultural attitudes towards guns and suicide also play significant roles. Therefore, the claim oversimplifies the issue and does not account for the complex interplay of various factors.

Answer: 0"
180,"Explanation: The claim is made by a politician, and it is a statement about their past actions and future intentions. However, without specific evidence or context, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness of the claim. Earmarks are a form of pork-barrel spending, and politicians often deny using them to maintain their image. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
181,"Explanation: The Open Meetings Act is a law that requires public bodies to hold open meetings and provide notice of those meetings to the public. It applies to all meetings of public bodies, including those involving the governor. Therefore, the claim that a meeting involving the governor is not covered by the Open Meetings Act is false.

Answer: 0"
182,"Explanation: The claim that Maureen Dowd's column quotes Obama as having received suspicious contributions from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and China is false. Maureen Dowd is a well-known columnist for The New York Times, but her columns do not contain such a claim. Additionally, there is no evidence to support that Barack Obama received suspicious contributions from these countries during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
183,"Explanation: The claim that 94 percent of Marco Rubio's constituents support a universal background check is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific source or data cited to support this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of this statement without additional evidence.

Answer: 0"
184,"Explanation: The claim that nobody has ever escaped from a federal ""supermax"" prison is false. There have been several instances of prisoners escaping from these facilities. For example, in 2019, a prisoner named David Sweat escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, which is a high-security prison. Additionally, in 2015, two prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, escaped from the ADX Florence prison in Colorado, which is a federal ""supermax"" prison. These incidents demonstrate that escapes from federal ""supermax"" prisons are not unprecedented.

Answer: 0"
185,"Explanation: The claim is false. The bill in question is the ""Endless Frontier Act,"" which was introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2021. The bill does not create a $50 billion slush fund. Instead, it establishes a new agency, the National Science and Technology Council, to coordinate federal research and development efforts. The bill also includes provisions for funding research and development in various fields, but it does not create a fund that can be used for virtually any purpose by the Treasury Secretary.

Answer: 0"
186,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama and the Democrats have ""proposed a tax for not having health insurance"" is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Obama, does include a provision for a penalty for not having health insurance, but it is not a tax. The penalty is often referred to as the ""individual mandate"" and is designed to encourage people to obtain health insurance. The penalty is not a tax in the traditional sense and is not collected by the IRS in the same way as taxes are.

Answer: 0"
187,"Explanation: The claim that animal abuse is often an indicative trait of future acts of violence against humans is supported by several studies and research findings. Animal abuse is often considered a ""red flag"" behavior, as it can indicate a pattern of violent behavior. This is because the perpetrator may not differentiate between humans and animals, and the abuse of animals can be a precursor to abuse against humans. However, it's important to note that not all individuals who abuse animals will go on to abuse humans, and the correlation is not absolute.

Answer: 1"
188,"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was a United States military policy that prohibited open discussion of sexual orientation in the military. The policy was repealed in 2011, and it is not accurate to say that all those who do not answer directly to the president have said that repealing it was a terrible idea. The claim is a generalization and does not reflect the diverse opinions of individuals who may or may not have been directly involved in the policy's repeal.

Answer: 0"
189,"Explanation: The claim is false. There have been Democratic women in Congress from New Jersey in recent decades. For example, Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democratic representative from New Jersey's 12th congressional district, has been serving since 2015. Therefore, the claim that there has not been a Democratic woman in Congress from New Jersey in almost four decades is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
190,"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration increased the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes by 70 percent is false. While it is true that the Obama administration deported a large number of immigrants, including those convicted of crimes, the increase in deportations was not 70 percent. The actual increase was around 25 percent from 2009 to 2016. This misrepresentation of the data is a common tactic used to spread misinformation.

Answer: 0"
191,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 10 richest counties in the United States are not all surrounding Washington, D.C. While some of the wealthiest counties are in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, such as Loudoun County, Virginia, and Fairfax County, Virginia, there are also wealthy counties in other parts of the country, such as Marin County, California, and Santa Clara County, California.

Answer: 0"
192,"Explanation: The claim that Washington has run out of money about halfway through fiscal year 2009 is false. The U.S. federal government does not ""run out of money"" in the sense that it cannot pay its bills. The federal government has the ability to borrow money to meet its obligations. In 2009, the U.S. government did face significant financial challenges due to the Great Recession, but it did not run out of money.

Answer: 0"
193,"Explanation: The claim that the person has tried over 100 jury cases in Travis County courts is not verifiable without additional context or evidence.

This information is available on the official website of the House of Representatives.

Answer: 0"
195,"Explanation: The claim that Panasonic stayed in New Jersey because of the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant (BRRAG) program is false. Panasonic's decision to stay in New Jersey was primarily driven by the company's long-term strategic plans and the state's business-friendly environment, rather than the BRRAG program. The BRRAG program is a state incentive program designed to help businesses relocate to New Jersey, but it is not the primary reason for Panasonic's decision to remain in the state.

Answer: 0"
196,"Explanation: The claim that ""Most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay"" is false. Federal employees are generally not covered by collective bargaining agreements, but they do have collective bargaining rights for certain benefits and pay. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) allows federal employees to bargain collectively over certain issues, including benefits and pay, but the specifics of what can be bargained over are limited compared to private sector employees. Therefore, the claim is misleading as it suggests that no federal employees have collective bargaining rights, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
197,"Explanation: The claim about offshore oil drilling is a general statement and does not provide specific information that can be verified as true or false. Offshore oil drilling is a well-documented and widely practiced industry, but the claim itself is too broad to be evaluated as true or false without additional context.

Answer: 0"
198,"Explanation: The claim is true. Same-day voter registration allows individuals to register to vote and cast their ballot on the same day. This process is designed to make voting more accessible and convenient for those who may not have previously registered. Therefore, it is possible for people to walk in and vote on the same day they register.

Answer: 1"
199,"Explanation: According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Rhode Island has consistently ranked among the states with the highest rates of substance abuse, including opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder. However, it's important to note that the ranking can change from year to year, and other states may also have high rates of substance abuse. Therefore, while Rhode Island has historically had high rates of substance abuse, it is not accurate to say that it continues to have the highest rates in the country without specifying the time period and comparing it to other states.

Answer: 0"
200,"Explanation: The claim that former U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered the ocean closed is clearly false. Presidents do not have the authority to close the ocean, and such a statement is not a part of any official policy or action taken by the Obama administration. This claim appears to be a humorous or satirical statement, often used to describe a situation where someone has made a ridiculous or extreme claim.

Answer: 0"
201,"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario that assumes the immediate opening of a gas reserve in Alaska and its impact on gas prices within five years. However, the actual impact of such a decision on gas prices is influenced by numerous factors, including market demand, supply chain logistics, geopolitical events, and regulatory policies. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific studies or data to support the assertion that gas prices would reach $2 per gallon within five years. Therefore, the claim is speculative and lacks concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
202,"Explanation: The claim is about John McCain's past and present positions on the payroll tax. The statement suggests that McCain previously expressed openness to lifting the cap on the payroll tax but is now criticizing someone else for holding the same position. This claim is true because it accurately reflects McCain's past and present stances on the issue.

Answer: 1"
203,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama added $16 trillion to the national debt is false. While it is true that the national debt increased significantly during his presidency, the total increase was approximately $10 trillion, not $16 trillion. This misinformation often arises from confusion between the national debt and the federal deficit, which is the annual increase in the debt.

Answer: 0"
204,"Explanation: The claim is true. Saudi Arabia has been involved in a military campaign in Yemen against the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran. This conflict has been ongoing since 2015 and has been a significant focus of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy. While Saudi Arabia has also been involved in efforts to combat ISIS, the focus on the Yemen conflict has been more prominent.

Answer: 1"
205,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has publicly stated that she supports comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. However, she has not explicitly advocated for ""open borders"" in the sense of unrestricted immigration. Her stance is more nuanced and focuses on reforming the immigration system rather than advocating for completely open borders.

Answer: 0"
206,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution grants the President the authority to use military force in certain circumstances, such as when there is an actual or imminent threat to the nation. However, the President must typically obtain authorization from Congress for military actions that do not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat. Unilateral military attacks without such authorization are not consistent with the U.S. Constitution and legal precedent.

Answer: 0"
207,"Explanation: Homosexuality is no longer a felony in any state in the U.S. The Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) struck down laws that criminalized sodomy, including those that targeted homosexuality. Since then, all states have repealed such laws. Therefore, the claim that homosexuality remains a felony in some states is false.

Answer: 0"
208,"Explanation: The claim is about a tax plan proposed by a candidate, and it's not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim without additional context or specific details about the tax plan. The claim itself is a statement made by a candidate, and without knowing the specifics of the plan or the calculations behind it, it's impossible to determine if it would indeed leave the federal government with a $1.1 trillion hole.

Answer: 0"
209,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government borrows money to fund its operations, but this does not mean that the money would be available for entrepreneurs and businesses if the government did not borrow. The money borrowed by the government is used to pay for government services, infrastructure, and other expenses. If the government did not borrow, it would likely have to raise taxes or cut spending to balance its budget, which could have negative effects on the economy. Additionally, the money borrowed by the government is not directly available for entrepreneurs and businesses to use for job creation and business expansion.

Answer: 0"
210,"Explanation: The claim that the person started criticizing the war in Iraq before Barack Obama did is false. Barack Obama was a vocal critic of the Iraq War before he became President. He publicly opposed the war in 2002 and 2003, well before he was elected in 2008. Therefore, the claim that someone else started criticizing the war in Iraq before Obama is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
211,"Explanation: The claim is false. Members of Congress have access to a different health insurance plan than other federal employees. Congress members and their families are eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a comprehensive health insurance plan. However, the specific plans and benefits available to members of Congress are different from those available to other federal employees. For instance, members of Congress have access to a more extensive network of providers and may have different cost-sharing arrangements.

Answer: 0"
212,"Claim: Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country.

Explanation: Georgia's ballot access laws are indeed considered among the most restrictive in the country. The state requires candidates to collect a significant number of signatures to qualify for the ballot, and the signature requirements are higher than in many other states. Additionally, Georgia has strict rules regarding the timing and placement of signature collection efforts. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
213,"Explanation: The claim that Sherrod Brown has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time is not accurate. While Sherrod Brown and Barack Obama are both Democrats, their voting records are not identical. The claim of a 95% agreement rate is an exaggeration. In reality, their voting records show a high level of agreement, but not to the extent of 95%.

Answer: 0"
214,"Explanation: The claim that Sidney Blumenthal wrote that the Benghazi attack was almost certainly preventable is false. Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton aide, did not write any such statement. The claim is a misinterpretation of Blumenthal's emails, which were released during the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails did not attribute the preventability of the Benghazi attack to Hillary Clinton or the State Department. The claim is a distortion of the facts and is not supported by any credible evidence.

Answer: 0"
215,"Explanation: The claim is true. The U.S. Congress did indeed raise the national debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion in December 2021. Additionally, the budget proposed by the Biden administration for the fiscal year 2022 includes a projected deficit of over $5 trillion over the next five years.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0"
217,"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold received a memo in 2009 outlining veteran harm at a Wisconsin VA facility and nothing was done is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. Russ Feingold, a former U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has not publicly mentioned receiving such a memo, and no such memo has been found in public records or media reports.

Answer: 0"
218,"Explanation: The claim that she is saving ratepayers $6 million/year is not verifiable without additional context or evidence. The statement could be a part of a political campaign or a press release, but without specific details or sources, it is impossible to confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
219,"Explanation: The claim states that recall organizers started their website last November and began work on their effort before he even took office. This claim is false because recall efforts typically begin after a politician takes office, not before. Recall efforts are usually initiated in response to a politician's actions or policies, which would not have been in place before they took office.

Answer: 0"
220,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general trend and correlation, but it lacks specific evidence or data to support the assertion that distracted driving, such as texting, is the primary cause of the rise in traffic deaths on Georgia roadways this year. While distracted driving is a significant factor in traffic accidents, it is not the only cause, and the claim does not provide specific data to support the claim.

Answer: 0"
221,"Explanation: The claim about homeowners across Ohio signing mineral rights agreements and over a billion dollars worth of leases being signed to date is not verifiable with the information provided. Mineral rights agreements are typically complex legal documents that involve specific properties and are not typically aggregated into a single figure for an entire state. Without specific sources or data to back up the claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
222,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution requires a supermajority of 60 senators to break a filibuster, but this is not the first time it has been required. The 60-vote threshold has been used in various instances throughout history, including during the Obama administration and the Trump administration. The claim that this is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
223,"Explanation: The claim is false. The State of Texas does use the E-Verify system to determine the employment eligibility of individuals. E-Verify is a web-based system that allows employers to verify the employment eligibility of their employees. Texas has implemented E-Verify as a requirement for certain employers, and it is used to ensure that employees are legally authorized to work in the United States.

Answer: 0"
224,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Texas General Land Office (GLO) does not earn money from wind leases that haven't produced energy. The GLO manages the state's land and mineral rights, but it does not generate revenue from leases that do not produce energy. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the GLO's role and responsibilities.

Answer: 0"
225,"Explanation: The claim that ""a couple of hundred American cities are infested by members of the Mexican cartels"" is an exaggeration. While it is true that Mexican cartels have a presence in some U.S. cities, the extent of their influence and the number of cities affected are often overstated. The U.S. Department of Justice and other law enforcement agencies have reported that cartels operate in a limited number of cities, primarily along the U.S.-Mexico border and in major metropolitan areas. The term ""infested"" suggests a widespread and significant presence, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
226,"Explanation: The claim that 50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens is not accurate. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, in 2019, 1,650 murders were reported in Texas, and only 10 percent of these were attributed to illegal immigrants. This information is based on data from the Texas Department of Public Safety and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Answer: 0"
227,"Explanation: The claim that there are very few women and children among Syrian refugees and migrants coming into Europe is not accurate. In reality, the gender distribution among Syrian refugees is roughly equal, with about 50% being women and 50% being children. The perception of fewer women and children may be due to the fact that men are often the ones making the journey first to establish a foothold in Europe, while women and children follow later. Additionally, the media often focuses on the male refugees, which can create a skewed perception.

Answer: 0"
228,"Explanation: The claim that Senator Robert Hurt voted for a bill that raised electric rates seven times is not accurate. Senator Hurt has not voted for such a bill. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a false statement.

Answer: 0"
229,"Explanation: The claim that a legislative debate on airport pat-down procedures initiated federal changes in security procedures is true. In 2013, there was a significant debate in the U.S. Congress about the use of pat-downs and other security procedures at airports, following the incident of a passenger who was subjected to a pat-down after being caught with a knife. This debate led to changes in the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) procedures, including the use of advanced imaging technology and the implementation of the ""Known Crew Member"" program. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"
230,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is a long-standing conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked. Abedin has consistently denied any such ties, and there is no credible evidence to support the claim. The Muslim Brotherhood is a controversial organization, and its members have been accused of various activities, but there is no evidence to suggest that Abedin is involved with them.

Answer: 0"
231,"Explanation: The claim ""Decorated Marine, two-tour Iraq war vet"" is vague and lacks specific details. It does not provide any concrete evidence or sources to verify the claim. Therefore, it is impossible to confirm the truthfulness of this statement without additional information.

Answer: 0"
232,"Explanation: The claim is false. The amount of money a person takes home after taxes depends on various factors such as the tax rate, deductions, and credits. The claim suggests a flat reduction of $125,000 from $250,000, which is not accurate. The actual take-home pay would be calculated based on the individual's tax bracket and other deductions.

Answer: 0"
233,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the funding sources of two political campaigns, the Doherty Campaign and the Cicilline Campaign. The claim states that the Doherty Campaign is funded mostly by individual donors, while the Cicilline Campaign relies on big PACs. To verify this claim, one would need to look at the campaign finance reports for both campaigns. However, without specific data, it is not possible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified with the given information.)"
234,"Explanation: The claim that the president and vice president cannot be from the same state is false. There is no constitutional or legal restriction that prevents the president and vice president from being from the same state. In fact, there have been instances where both the president and vice president were from the same state. For example, in 1993, both President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were from Tennessee.

235,"Explanation: The claim is made by a political figure, suggesting that they campaigned on the proposals in the budget repair bill for Wisconsin. This claim is subjective and depends on the specific proposals and the extent to which they were emphasized during the campaign. Without specific details about the proposals and the campaign, it is difficult to verify the claim's accuracy. However, the statement ""Anybody who says they are shocked on this has been asleep for the past two years"" suggests that the proposals were well-known and discussed during the campaign.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true based on the statement that the proposals were well-known and discussed during the campaign.)"
236,"Explanation: The claim is made by a former mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, and it includes specific references to various publications and years. However, the claim is not verifiable through reliable sources. USA Today, Money Magazine, and All Cities Almanac are real publications, but the specific claims made about Providence's ranking and safety are not substantiated by any credible sources. Therefore, the claim cannot be independently verified as true.

Answer: 0"
237,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic that is not supported by reliable sources. The Guttmacher Institute, which is a leading research and policy organization on reproductive health, reports that major complications from abortion are rare. According to their data, the rate of major complications from abortion is less than 0.1% (1 in 1,000). The claim of 2 to 3 Texas women per week having major complications and 10 women per week seeking help at an ER after an abortion is not supported by credible sources and appears to be an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
238,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible source or evidence provided to support the claim that 99 people from the Department of Taxation were let go the next day after the governor announced his jobs budget. This information is not widely reported or verified by reliable news outlets.

Answer: 0"
239,"Explanation: Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is a tool used by local governments to fund infrastructure and development projects. When a TIF district is created, the property taxes generated within that district are used to fund the project. The general fund is not directly impacted by TIF because the taxes are specifically allocated to the project. Therefore, the claim that TIF funding will take funds from the general fund for Pinellas County or the city of St. Pete is false.

Answer: 0"
240,"Explanation: The claim that illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion every year is often cited but is not accurate. The actual economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy is more complex and varies by year. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy is estimated to be around $200 billion to $250 billion annually, not $100 billion. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
241,"Explanation: The claim that criminals have learned how to spy on Americans by hacking into home computers and looking through video cameras attached to screens is a common misconception. While it is true that hackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to computers and use webcams, the claim that this is a widespread or common practice among criminals is not supported by evidence. Most cybersecurity experts advise against using webcams for security purposes due to the risk of hacking, but this does not mean that criminals are actively spying on Americans through this method.

Answer: 0"
242,"Explanation: The claim states that Texas public school funding grew three times the rate of enrollment from 2002 to 2012. To verify this, we need to look at the actual data for both funding and enrollment during this period. According to the Texas Education Agency, the total funding for public schools in Texas increased from $20.4 billion in 2002 to $47.7 billion in 2012. Meanwhile, the student enrollment increased from 3.5 million to 4.8 million during the same period. The growth rate of funding was approximately 135% (from $20.4 billion to $47.7 billion), while the growth rate of enrollment was approximately 42% (from 3.5 million to 4.8 million). Therefore, the funding did not grow three times the rate of enrollment.

Answer: 0"
243,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio has lost over 100,000 jobs since the stimulus package was passed is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Ohio's unemployment rate has been decreasing since the implementation of the stimulus package. As of the latest data, Ohio's unemployment rate has been below 5%, indicating a recovery in the job market. Therefore, the claim that Ohio has lost over 100,000 jobs is false.

Answer: 0"
244,"Explanation: The claim is false. Jim Doyle served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2003 to 2011, and Mary Burke served as the Secretary of Commerce from 2011 to 2013. The claim that Wisconsin saw billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones, and garbage during this period is not accurate. There were no significant tax hikes on these items during their tenure.

Answer: 0"
245,"Explanation: The claim that Connie Mack wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation to get $29 million in stimulus for his congressional district is false. There is no evidence or record of such a letter or request.

Answer: 0"
246,"Explanation: The claim that Apple's CEO Tim Cook will not do business with Indiana is false. Apple has not announced any such policy, and there is no evidence to suggest that Tim Cook or Apple has taken any action to boycott Indiana. Apple has operations and stores in Indiana, and the company has not made any public statements indicating a change in their business practices regarding the state.

Answer: 0"
247,"Explanation: The claim that the GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters is false. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders. It is calculated as the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy. While GDP can fluctuate and may even decrease in certain quarters, it is highly unlikely to be zero. Economic activity, even in the most severe economic downturns, does not cease entirely, and thus GDP would not be zero.

Answer: 0"
248,"Explanation: The claim is about job gains in New Jersey (McMansion State) since Chris Christie took office. It states that while there have been some job gains, they have lagged behind the nation as a whole and the states of New York and Connecticut. This claim is based on a comparison of job growth rates, which can be verified through official economic data sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or state-specific economic reports.

Answer: 1"
249,"Explanation: The claim is false. The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) did not estimate that 4.7 million Americans would lose their jobs if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed. The CEA's analysis of the ACA's impact on employment was more nuanced and did not predict a significant loss of jobs. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the CEA's findings.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 1"
252,"Explanation: The claim that ""most state employees did not receive any pay raise from 2009 to 2012"" is not verifiable with the information provided. The term ""most"" is subjective and could vary depending on the specific criteria used to define ""most."" Additionally, the claim does not specify the source of the information or provide any evidence to support it. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false without additional context or data.

Answer: 0"
253,"Explanation: The claim about Tom Ganley receiving the FBI's highest civilian award for fighting back against an organized crime syndicate is false.

254,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Georgia Policy Project, which found that the number of classroom teachers in Georgia's public schools decreased by approximately 8,800 between 2009 and 2019, while the student population increased by about 100,000 during the same period. This data is accurate and supports the claim.

Answer: 1"
255,"Explanation: The claim about the privatization of Social Security is complex and depends on the specific context and details of the claim. Social Security is a government-run program that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible individuals. Privatization typically refers to the transfer of government services or assets to private entities. In the context of Social Security, privatization could mean shifting the system to private accounts or reducing government control over the program.

However, the claim itself is vague and does not specify whether it is referring to a specific proposal, law, or policy change. Without more context or specific details, it is difficult to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or incomplete as it lacks specific details to be judged as true.)"
256,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified information indicating that U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson supports a plan for privatizing Social Security. The claim appears to be a misrepresentation or a misunderstanding of his political stance.

Answer: 0"
257,"Explanation: The claim that Iran continues to pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons is a complex issue that has been subject to various interpretations and assessments. While Iran has been accused by some countries and organizations of pursuing nuclear weapons, it is important to note that Iran has consistently maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been monitoring Iran's nuclear activities, and while there have been concerns and disputes, the IAEA has not found conclusive evidence that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the claim that Iran continues to pursue nuclear weapons is not universally accepted as true by all objective observers.

Answer: 0"
258,"Explanation: The claim that ""we are already bombing seven countries"" is not accurate. As of my last update in October 2023, the United States has been involved in military operations in several countries, but the exact number of countries being bombed can vary and is often subject to change. It's important to note that the number of countries involved in military operations can change frequently due to political and military developments. Therefore, the claim as stated is not specific and cannot be verified as true or false without more context.

Answer: 0"
259,"Explanation: The claim that 67 percent of marriages now wind up in divorce is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the divorce rate has been declining in recent years. In 2019, the divorce rate was around 2.7 per 1,000 people, which is a significant decrease from the peak in the 1980s. Therefore, the claim that 67 percent of marriages end in divorce is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
260,"Explanation: Russ Feingold has indeed worked outside of politics. He served as a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin from 1993 to 2011. After leaving the Senate, he worked as a lawyer and consultant, including serving as a senior advisor to the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. Therefore, the claim that he has not worked anywhere outside of politics is false.

Answer: 0"
261,"Explanation: The Towpath Trail, a 101-mile trail that follows the route of the Ohio & Erie Canal, was completed in 1999. The Ohio & Erie Canal, which was built between 1825 and 1832, took approximately 17 years to complete. Therefore, it is true that it took more time to complete the Towpath Trail than it did to build the Ohio & Erie Canal.

Answer: 1"
262,"Explanation: The claim that an increase in the number of vaccines administered to children in the United States has led to an increase in the autism rate is a misconception. Multiple studies have found no link between vaccines and autism. The original study that suggested a link between vaccines and autism has been widely discredited and retracted. The increase in autism rates is primarily attributed to better diagnosis and awareness, not to vaccines.

Answer: 0"
263,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker has removed the 250,000 jobs promise from his website is false. As of my last update in October 2023, Scott Walker's campaign website still includes information about his economic plans, including job creation. The claim may have been based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of changes to his website's content.

Answer: 0"
264,"Explanation: The claim is false. The New York Times did not have to retract its story about Hillary Clinton's email handling. The Times' initial report in 2016 stated that Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State was ""inconsistent with the practices of other government officials."" However, the FBI investigation into the matter did not find evidence that Clinton had broken any laws. The Times did not retract its story, and the claim that they did is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Without specific context or evidence, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge it as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
267,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton's health care plan from the 1990s, known as the Health Security Act, did not have a broader provision in favor of corporate right to back out of providing contraceptive coverage than the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision. In fact, the Health Security Act proposed a mandate for employers to provide contraceptive coverage, which was later challenged by Hobby Lobby in the Supreme Court. The Hobby Lobby decision, which was decided in 2014, allowed for-profit corporations to refuse to provide contraceptive coverage based on religious beliefs, which was not a provision in Clinton's 1990s plan.

Answer: 0"
268,"Explanation: Wisconsin's non-discrimination law, specifically the Wisconsin Fair Employment Act, does protect members of the transgender community.

Answer: 1"
270,"Explanation: The claim that Obama plans ""a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year"" is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama did propose tax increases for higher-income individuals, but the threshold was significantly higher than $42,000. For example, his 2013 proposal included a tax increase for individuals earning more than $400,000 and couples earning more than $450,000. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
271,"Explanation: The claim that ""half the kids coming out of college this year cant find a job, or a job that's consistent with a college degree"" is an exaggeration. While it is true that some graduates may struggle to find employment or jobs that align with their degree, the claim that ""half"" of them face this issue is not accurate. According to various sources, the unemployment rate for recent graduates is typically around 5-10%, not 50%. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
272,"Explanation: The payday loan industry does exist in Minnesota. According to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, payday lending is legal in Minnesota, and there are payday lenders operating in the state. Therefore, the claim that the payday loan industry does not exist in Minnesota is false.

Answer: 0"
273,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton's health care plan, often referred to as ""Medicare for All,"" would indeed provide health care coverage for all Americans. However, it is not accurate to say that it is the only plan that covers every American. There are other plans and proposals, such as the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and various state-level initiatives, that also aim to provide health care coverage to Americans. Therefore, the claim that Hillary Clinton's plan is the only one that covers every American is false.

Answer: 0"
274,"Explanation: The claim is made by a news anchor or journalist, and it is a statement about their personal history and professional ethics.

However, if the claim is made in a public forum or interview, it is likely that the person's past endorsements would be a matter of public record or easily verifiable.

Answer: 0"
275,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 9/11 terrorists were not sent back to Saudi Arabia, and their friends, family, and girlfriends were not aware of their plans. The 9/11 hijackers were all from Saudi Arabia, and their families were not involved in the attacks. The claim is a misinterpretation of the fact that some of the hijackers' families were allowed to return to Saudi Arabia after the attacks, but this was due to diplomatic and legal processes, not because they were sent back to watch their boyfriends on television.

Answer: 0"
276,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Koch brothers did not give twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett. According to the Federal Election Commission, the Koch brothers' political action committee, Americans for Prosperity, contributed $1.5 million to Scott Walker's campaign, while Tom Barrett raised a total of $1.2 million from all sources. Therefore, the Koch brothers did not give twice as much money to Scott Walker as Barrett raised.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified with the given information.)"
279,"Explanation: The claim suggests that there are significant overcounts in the job creation numbers reported by Start-Up NY.

To accurately assess the claim, one would need to review the methodology used in the compilation, examine the data sources, and compare the reported numbers with other relevant data sets.

Answer: 0"
280,"Explanation: The claim that the omnibus spending bill has 9,427 pork barrel items is false. The term ""pork barrel"" is often used to describe items in a bill that are included to benefit a specific group or region, rather than the general public. However, the number 9,427 is not a widely cited or verified figure for the number of pork barrel items in any specific omnibus spending bill. This claim appears to be a misrepresentation or exaggeration.

Answer: 0"

The events of the Benghazi attack occurred on September 11, 2012, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was not in her bed at the time. She was in the process of responding to the situation, and there is no evidence to support the claim that she was sleeping.

283,"Explanation: The claim that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sent his advisers to study socialism with Soviet dictator Josef Stalin is false. While it is true that Roosevelt and Stalin had meetings and discussions during World War II, these meetings were primarily focused on military strategy and the war effort, not on studying socialism. Roosevelt's New Deal policies were influenced by various sources, including the British welfare state and American progressive ideas, but not by Soviet socialism. The claim is a misinterpretation of historical events.

Answer: 0"
284,"Explanation: The claim is false. The unemployment rate in the United States has been above 9% for two consecutive years during the Great Recession in 2009 and 2010.

Pam Bondi, who served as the Attorney General of Florida from 2011 to 2019, has publicly stated her opposition to same-sex marriage and has been critical of the legalization of same-sex marriage in Florida. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that she refuses to take a position on the issue.

Answer: 1"
296,"Explanation: The claim that repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would save $95 billion in 2016 is false. The $95 billion figure is a misinterpretation of a study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that estimated the cost of repealing the ACA. The CBO's report stated that repealing the ACA would reduce federal spending by $145 billion over 10 years, not $95 billion in 2016. Additionally, repealing the ACA would likely increase the number of uninsured Americans, leading to higher costs for hospitals and other healthcare providers, which would offset any savings.

Answer: 0"
297,"Explanation: The claim that a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions is not accurate. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), repeat offenders are a significant factor in drunk driving incidents. The NHTSA reports that approximately 30% of drivers involved in fatal crashes had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08 or higher, and many of these drivers had prior convictions for driving under the influence (DUI). Therefore, the claim that a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by offenders with no prior convictions is false.

302,"Explanation: The claim that health insurance premiums ""have almost doubled ... since 2000"" is misleading. While it is true that health insurance premiums have increased significantly over the past two decades, the claim of ""almost doubling"" is an exaggeration. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average annual premium for a family health insurance plan in 2000 was $2,196, while in 2020 it was $21,342. This represents an increase of about 920%, not ""almost doubling.""

Answer: 0"
309,"Explanation: The claim is difficult to verify without specific data or sources. However, it is important to note that the claim is not impossible, as political corruption and misconduct can occur in any state. To accurately judge the claim, one would need to compare the number of convictions, sanctions, or accusations in New York State with those in other states over the past decade. Without such data, it is not possible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific data.)"
310,"Explanation: The claim that uninsured Americans did not buy insurance because of the expense is true.

314,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare has caused millions of hardworking Virginians to lose their health insurance is misleading. While it's true that some people have lost their health insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, the claim that millions of Virginians have lost their insurance is an exaggeration. The ACA has also provided health insurance to many who were previously uninsured. According to the Commonwealth of Virginia, as of 2021, approximately 400,000 Virginians have gained health insurance through the ACA marketplace. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
315,"Explanation: According to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, as of 2021, there were approximately 1.2 million hunting and fishing licenses issued in Tennessee.

This is a complex claim that requires verification of multiple pieces of information. First, we need to identify the person in question and verify their political aspirations and current status. Second, we need to check the accuracy of the statement about their ballot history. Without specific details about the person and their political career, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim.

Answer: 0"
318,"Explanation: The claim about people trying to vote multiple times a day is a common misconception. In most democratic systems, voting is designed to be a single, one-time event per person to ensure the integrity of the election process. While there may be isolated incidents of voter fraud or attempts to vote multiple times, these are not widespread or typical occurrences. The claim is likely an exaggeration or a misunderstanding of the voting process.

322,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, allows states to establish their own health insurance exchanges. However, some states have chosen not to establish their own exchanges and instead rely on the federal exchange. Georgia is one of the states that has not established its own exchange and instead uses the federal exchange. Therefore, the claim that operating a healthcare exchange would be illegal in Georgia is false because the state has not prohibited the operation of a healthcare exchange.

Answer: 0"
323,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not require individuals with existing health insurance, such as through their job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, to change their coverage or their doctor.

The distribution of top prescribers is likely more widespread across the country, with significant concentrations in other states as well.

Answer: 0"

334,"Explanation: The claim is false. After the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015, the White House did not make a statement that ISIS could not reach the United States. In fact, the U.S. government has been actively working to prevent and respond to potential terrorist threats, including those from ISIS. The claim is a misrepresentation of the actual events and statements made by the White House.

Answer: 0"
335,"Explanation: The claim that the pension system was funded at 100% in 2001 and 2002 is false. The funding level of the pension system is typically expressed as a percentage of the total pension liabilities that are covered by the system's assets.

337,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement from the U.S. Treasury Department's report on the U.S. Debt to the Public. According to the report, as of December 31, 2021, the U.S. had a public debt of $28.4 trillion. The claim states that $1.4 trillion was borrowed, which is not accurate as the total public debt is much higher. Additionally, the claim that ""over half of this debt is held by foreign investors"" is not supported by the data provided in the report. The report shows that as of December 31, 2021, foreign investors held $6.3 trillion of the U.S. public debt, which is approximately 22% of the total public debt.

Answer: 0"
338,"Explanation: The claim that ""The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me"" is a subjective statement that cannot be objectively verified without specific context or data.

Therefore, the claim that he voted against it is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
342,"Explanation: The claim that the government wants to require farm tractor drivers to hold commercial drivers licenses even if they're just crossing a single public road is false. In the United States, for example, farm tractors are generally exempt from commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements, as they are not considered commercial vehicles. The CDL requirements typically apply to vehicles used for commercial purposes, such as transporting goods or passengers for hire. Farm tractors are primarily used for agricultural purposes and are not subject to the same regulations as commercial vehicles.

Answer: 0"
343,"Explanation: The claim about 6,200 election-day registrations from 2008 in Minnesota being fraudulent is false.

345,"Explanation: A balanced budget amendment is a proposal to require the federal government to balance its budget each year. This means that the government would not be allowed to spend more money than it collects in revenue. The idea behind this amendment is to prevent the government from running large deficits and accumulating significant debt. However, the claim itself is not a statement of fact but rather a description of a policy proposal. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false in the context of a news claim.

Therefore, the claim is true.

349,"Explanation: Historically, Senate ratification of arms control treaties has often been bipartisan, with significant support from both Democratic and Republican senators. This bipartisan support is often driven by the shared interest in maintaining international stability and preventing nuclear proliferation.

Therefore, while the claim is generally true, it is not universally applicable.

Answer: 1"
350,"Explanation: The claim that Aaron Bean voted to give health care subsidies to illegal immigrants is false.

The claim seems to be an exaggeration or a misrepresentation of the actual amount.

Answer: 0"
352,"Explanation: The claim that the 2009-11 state budget approved by Democrats left Wisconsin taxpayers $3.6 billion in debt is false. The 2009-11 budget was approved by a bipartisan group of legislators, including Republicans, and the debt figure of $3.6 billion is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
358,"Explanation: The claim that job creation has gotten worse each year that Scott Walker has been governor is a generalization that can be misleading. Job creation can vary significantly from year to year due to numerous factors such as economic cycles, industry-specific trends, and national economic conditions. While it is true that job creation can fluctuate, it is not accurate to say that it has consistently gotten worse each year during Walker's tenure as governor. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
359,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Pentagon is indeed exempt from the federal law that requires all federal agencies to complete annual audits. This exemption is due to the complexity and size of the Pentagon's operations, which make it difficult to conduct a comprehensive audit. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has acknowledged this exemption and has not required the Pentagon to conduct an annual audit.

Answer: 1"
360,"Explanation: The claim that we now have the greatest income inequality since the Great Depression is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources. According to these data, the income inequality in the United States has been increasing since the 1970s, with the top 1% of earners capturing a larger share of the total income. However, it is important to note that the Great Depression was a unique historical event with extreme economic conditions, and comparing current income inequality to that period requires careful consideration of the context and data sources.

362,"Explanation: The claim is false. Nevada lawmakers did not vote to allow teenaged boys to shower with teenaged girls in public school locker rooms. This misinformation has been circulating due to a misunderstanding of a bill that was introduced in 2019, which aimed to protect transgender students from discrimination. The bill did not allow boys to shower with girls, but rather aimed to ensure that transgender students could use the locker rooms that correspond to their gender identity. The bill was not passed and did not become law.

Answer: 0"
363,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Rick Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls is false. In 2018, Florida's Secretary of State, Ken Detzner, announced that 180,000 voters had been removed from the rolls due to a lack of recent voting activity. This was a routine process to maintain the accuracy of the voter rolls, not an attempt by Gov. Rick Scott to remove voters. The claim incorrectly attributes this action to Scott.

Answer: 0"
373,"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare is false. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to expand health insurance coverage, not reduce it. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the number of uninsured Floridians decreased from 2.5 million in 2013 to 1.3 million in 2019, which is a significant reduction. The claim of 300,000 Floridians losing their health insurance is not supported by reliable data.

The U.S. spends around $10,966 per capita, while the U.K. spends around $4,900 and France spends around $5,500. This means the U.S. spends approximately 2.2 times more than the U.K. and about 1.03 times more than France, which is slightly more than 50% more than France.

Answer: 1"
376,"Explanation: The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act is a proposed law that would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The claim that the DREAM Act would give amnesty to over two million illegal aliens is an exaggeration. The DREAM Act would only apply to a subset of undocumented immigrants who meet specific criteria, such as having arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16 and having lived in the country continuously since that time. The exact number of beneficiaries is difficult to determine, but it is not accurate to say that it would apply to over two million people.

The claim does not specify which administration or period is being referred to, but the overall statement is inaccurate.

378,"Explanation: The claim that the measles vaccine does not cause autism is supported by extensive scientific research and consensus among the medical and scientific communities. Multiple studies have investigated the potential link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism, and none have found a causal relationship. The most famous study that initially suggested a link, published by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, was later retracted due to serious procedural errors, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, and ethical violations. The overwhelming consensus among scientists and health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.

Answer: 1"
379,"Explanation: A tax on soda and juice drinks would indeed disproportionately affect low-income families in Philadelphia. This is because low-income families often rely more heavily on these beverages as part of their daily caloric intake, and a tax would increase their overall expenditure on food and drinks. Additionally, low-income families may not have access to healthier alternatives or may not be able to afford them, making the tax more burdensome for them.

Answer: 1"
380,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that a citizen with a gun stopped the Clackamas Town Center shooting in 2012, Kip Kinkel's shooting at Thurston High School in 1998 was not stopped by a citizen with a gun. In fact, Kinkel was stopped by police officers after he had already killed two students and wounded 22 others. The claim incorrectly suggests that a citizen with a gun stopped both incidents.

Answer: 0"
381,"Explanation: The claim that ""not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police in New York in about 45 years"" is false.

Answer: 0"
384,"Explanation: The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) does indeed place the responsibility for cleanup and containment of oil spills primarily on the party responsible for the spill. This is often referred to as the ""polluter pays"" principle. The act requires the responsible party to take immediate action to prevent or minimize the discharge of oil and to provide for the cleanup of the oil. The Obama administration, like any other administration, would be bound by this law. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
385,"Explanation: FirstEnergys annual revenues are not greater than the GDP of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, or 15 African nations. The GDP of these countries and the revenues of FirstEnergy are not comparable in the same context.

The GDP of these countries is a measure of their total economic output, while FirstEnergy's revenues are a measure of its business performance. Therefore, the claim is false.

While the speaker's office may have some oversight or influence over legislative mail, it is not accurate to say that all aspects of it are approved by the speaker's office. The content and timing of legislative mail can be influenced by various factors, including the legislative agenda, the priorities of the speaker, and the input of other legislators and staff.

Answer: 0"
389,"Explanation: The claim that ""above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth"" is not accurate. According to various studies and reports, the number of Muslims who are radicalized or extremist is a small fraction of the global Muslim population. For instance, a 2019 Pew Research Center report estimated that about 13% of Muslims worldwide hold extremist views, which translates to around 200 million people. This is significantly less than the 800 million figure stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim that more than half of Muslims are radicalized is false.

Answer: 0"
390,"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplistic assumption that freezing spending at 2007 levels would automatically balance the budget and cut the national debt in half by 2020. However, this ignores several factors:
1. **Economic Growth**: The economy grows over time, and spending needs to grow with it to maintain services and infrastructure.
2. **Inflation**: Prices increase over time, so the value of money decreases. Therefore, spending needs to increase to maintain the same level of services.
3. **Demographic Changes**: Population growth and aging can increase spending on social services.
4. **Economic Downturns**: Economic crises, like the 2008 financial crisis, can lead to increased spending to stimulate the economy.

Given these factors, freezing spending at 2007 levels would not balance the budget or cut the national debt in half by 2020. The claim is therefore false.

Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, and it is funded by taxes and premiums. There have been discussions and proposals to reform Medicare, but no significant legislation has been passed to end the program. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of ongoing debates about Medicare's future.

Answer: 0"
397,"Explanation: The claim that Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel under Hosni Mubarak's rule is not accurate. While Egypt did receive significant financial aid from the United States during Mubarak's rule, it is not accurate to say that it received more than any other country besides Israel.

399,"Explanation: The claim that ""Probably less than 4 percent of Wisconsin residents are enjoying the subsidies from Obamacare"" is difficult to verify without specific data. However, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of 2021, approximately 11% of Wisconsin residents were enrolled in the Medicaid expansion program, which is a part of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This suggests that the claim is likely an underestimation.

Answer: 0"
400,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every other democracy in the world has a health care system that covers everybody, and we don't"" is not entirely accurate. While many democracies do have universal healthcare systems, there are exceptions.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
401,"Explanation: The claim that Tom Nelson backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million, is false. Tom Nelson, a former Wisconsin state senator, has been a vocal opponent of raising taxes on Social Security.

The claim about a $95 million cost to Wisconsin seniors is not supported by any credible sources or evidence.

Answer: 0"
402,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the General Assembly's business was almost entirely completed by 11 PM, implying that the late-night session was not significant. However, this claim is not verifiable without specific sources or evidence. The percentage of business done by a certain time is not a standard metric reported in news articles about General Assembly sessions. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

403,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump always pays his bills promptly is not entirely accurate. While there have been instances where Trump has paid his bills on time, there have also been reports of delayed payments and even lawsuits related to unpaid bills.

Therefore, the claim that he always pays his bills promptly is an oversimplification and is not entirely true.

404,"Explanation: The claim is true. The most recent example of a Supreme Court nominee being confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate during an election year is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's confirmation in 1993.

Answer: 1"
405,"Explanation: The claim that more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners is an overgeneralization and an exaggeration. While intimate partner violence is a serious issue, the actual number of women who die from such violence is lower. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 43,000 women die each year from intimate partner violence, which translates to about 118 women per day. This number is significantly lower than the claim of more than three women per day.

Answer: 0"
406,"Explanation: The claim that Rick Perry and the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature managed to slash the budget of the volunteer fire departments in Texas by 75 percent in the last legislative session is false. While there have been budget cuts to various state agencies, including fire departments, the claim of a 75 percent reduction is an exaggeration. The actual cuts were more modest, and the state has been working to restore funding to these departments. Additionally, the claim that these cuts have reduced their abilities to fight recent wildfires is not supported by evidence.

407,"Explanation: Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, has indeed expressed his opposition to abortion, including in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother. He has supported legislation that would restrict abortion access, including a 2013 law that required women to undergo an ultrasound before having an abortion. However, it's important to note that Walker's views on abortion are part of a broader political stance and do not necessarily reflect a desire to make abortion illegal in all circumstances.

Answer: 0"
410,"Explanation: The claim that Medicaid has grown by 1,600 percent in the last 30 years in Virginia is misleading. While Medicaid enrollment has indeed increased significantly over time, a 1,600 percent growth rate is not accurate. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicaid enrollment in Virginia has grown from approximately 1.2 million enrollees in 1990 to around 1.7 million enrollees in 2020. This represents a growth rate of about 42 percent, not 1,600 percent.

Answer: 0"
411,"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario where Proposition 1 is rejected. The cost of a new City-run criminal background check process would depend on various factors such as the scope of the checks, the number of people involved, and the efficiency of the process. While it's possible that such a process could incur significant costs, the claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that it would cost ""millions"" in processing fees, additional staff, and bureaucracy. Therefore, the claim is speculative and lacks concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
412,"Explanation: The claim that Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times is false.

This withdrawal was not an abrupt action by the administration but rather a result of the Senate's review process.

Answer: 0"
415,"Explanation: The claim that the tax changes in January 2023 are ""OBAMA TAX HIKES"" is false. The tax changes in question are part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law by President Trump, not President Obama. Additionally, the claim that these tax changes will ""slam every American's savings, investments, and job opportunity"" is not supported by evidence. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was designed to provide tax relief to individuals and businesses, and its impact on savings, investments, and job opportunities has been a subject of ongoing debate and analysis.

Answer: 0"
416,"Explanation: The claim states that Paul Workman voted in the Democrat primary, supporting Democrats with his vote.

417,"Explanation: The claim is made by Ken Paxton, the current Attorney General of Texas. As of my last update, there is no publicly available evidence to suggest that he has personally prosecuted judges, district attorneys, or other public officials for corruption or violation of public trust.

Answer: 0"
418,"Explanation: The claim that ""Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax"" is based on a misinterpretation of a study by the Tax Policy Center. The study found that 47% of Americans do not pay federal income tax, but this does not mean they pay no tax at all. Many of these individuals are low-income earners who do not earn enough to owe federal income tax, but they may still pay other taxes such as payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare) or state and local taxes. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
419,"Explanation: The claim that Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto an equal pay bill is false. There is no evidence or credible source supporting this claim.

420,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has stated that he believes in traditional marriage and has expressed opposition to same-sex marriage. However, he has not explicitly stated that he would deny gay people the right to adopt children. In fact, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, supported adoption rights for same-sex couples. Therefore, the claim that Romney would deny gay people the right to adopt children is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
421,"Explanation: The claim about the average Medicaid costs for people who had been homeless for a year or more in Rhode Island is not supported by any reliable sources. There is no specific study or data that supports this claim. Medicaid costs can vary greatly depending on the individual's health needs, and a single figure of $60,000 per person is not representative of the actual costs.

This is outlined in the U.S. Constitution and federal election laws.

Answer: 0"
424,"Explanation: The claim that baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws is false. While baseball has historically been exempt from antitrust laws due to a 1922 Supreme Court decision (Federated Press v. McLaughlin), insurance is not exempt. The insurance industry is subject to antitrust laws, and there have been several antitrust cases involving insurance companies. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
425,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does include provisions related to tort reform. Specifically, it includes a provision that limits the amount of non-economic damages that can be awarded in medical malpractice lawsuits. This is often referred to as ""tort reform."" Therefore, the claim that the healthcare law includes tort reform is true.

Answer: 1"
426,"Explanation: The claim that ""women care most about jobs and the economy"" is a generalization and not universally true. While economic stability and job security are important to many women, they also care about a wide range of issues such as education, healthcare, gender equality, and social justice. These concerns are not exclusive to women and are shared by many individuals regardless of gender. Therefore, the claim oversimplifies and stereotypes women's interests.

The story was popularized by McCain during his 2000 Senate campaign, but it has been debunked by multiple sources, including the U.S. Senate Historical Office and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. The story was never substantiated with concrete evidence, and it is now generally accepted as a myth.

428,"Explanation: The claim about a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in New Jersey's 2012 fiscal budget is false. According to the New Jersey Office of the State Comptroller, the state's budget for the 2012 fiscal year was $30.7 billion, and the projected shortfall was approximately $1.2 billion, not $10.5 billion. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresents the actual budget situation.

Answer: 0"
430,"Explanation: The claim that approximately 70 percent of jobs created in the United States in November 2007-2008 were in Texas is not accurate.

Additionally, the claim does not provide a source or specific data to support the 70 percent figure.

Answer: 0"
431,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the average healthcare costs for private sector employees and city workers in Ohio. While it is possible to find specific data points that might support this claim, the statement itself is not a universally accepted or verifiable fact. Healthcare costs can vary greatly depending on the specific employer, the health insurance plan chosen, and other factors. Therefore, the claim is not universally true and lacks specific sources to back it up.

Answer: 0"
432,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, also known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission, did not produce a completely empty report. The commission, which was established by President Obama in 2010, released a report titled ""The Moment of Truth"" that included recommendations for reducing the federal deficit, including suggestions for controlling healthcare costs. The report proposed a variety of measures, such as reducing Medicare and Medicaid spending, increasing the eligibility age for Medicare, and implementing a value-based payment system for healthcare providers.

Answer: 0"
433,"Explanation: The claim that a new financial regulation ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks"" is false. Financial regulations are typically designed to prevent future crises and protect taxpayers from bearing the costs of bank failures. While there may be provisions for bank resolution or liquidation, these are not bailouts in the traditional sense, as they do not involve the government providing funds to banks to avoid failure. The claim misrepresents the purpose and effect of financial regulations.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
440,"Explanation: The claim that the Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10 west of Houston, is the widest freeway in the world with up to 26 lanes, including frontage road lanes, is false. While the Katy Freeway is indeed one of the widest in the United States, it does not have 26 lanes. The maximum number of lanes on the Katy Freeway is 22, including frontage road lanes. The claim exaggerates the number of lanes and the significance of the Katy Freeway in terms of being the widest in the world.

442,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Donald Trump allowed Moammar Gadhafi to set up an elaborate tent at his Westchester County estate. In fact, Gadhafi's visit to the United Nations in 1992 was a well-documented event, and he stayed at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, not at Trump's estate. Additionally, Trump was not in office during Gadhafi's visit.

Answer: 0"
443,"Explanation: The claim states that the unemployment rate has decreased by 2 percentage points in the last year. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in January 2022 was 3.8%, and in January 2021, it was 6.4%. This means the unemployment rate has indeed decreased by 2.6 percentage points, not 2. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
444,"Explanation: The claim that 47% of members of Congress are millionaires is false.

Additionally, the term ""ample"" is subjective and can be interpreted differently by different people.

Answer: 0"
446,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific event, the CNBC debate, and the nature of the questions asked. Without specific details about the debate and the questions asked, it's challenging to verify the claim. However, if the claim is that the questions were discredited attacks from Democrats and political opponents, it would require evidence to support this assertion. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
447,"Explanation: As of the latest data available, the total number of people employed in the United States is significantly higher than the total population of Canada. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. had approximately 160 million people employed in 2021. Meanwhile, the population of Canada is around 38 million. Therefore, the claim that there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada is false.

Answer: 0"
448,"Explanation: The claim that Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month is not accurate. The cost of living in Iraq varies greatly depending on the region, income level, and lifestyle. While some households may face financial burdens due to economic instability, it is not accurate to generalize that each household is costing $100 a month. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the economic situation in Iraq.

Answer: 0"
449,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim, I would need to compare the unemployment rates of various big cities in New Jersey. As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time data to verify this claim.

450,"Explanation: The claim that crime in Atlanta is down 18 percent since 2009 can be evaluated by checking reliable sources such as the Atlanta Police Department, FBI crime statistics, or reputable news outlets. According to the Atlanta Police Department's annual reports and FBI crime statistics, there has been a significant decrease in crime rates in Atlanta over the past decade. However, the exact percentage of decrease can vary depending on the specific type of crime and the time period considered. Therefore, the claim that crime is down by exactly 18 percent since 2009 is not verifiable with the information provided.

Answer: 0"
451,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama said the individual mandate was not a tax is false. In fact, during the debate over the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Obama repeatedly stated that the individual mandate was a tax. For example, in a 2009 interview with ABC News, he said, ""If you don't have health insurance, you're going to have to pay a penalty."" This penalty was later ruled a tax by the Supreme Court in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius.

Answer: 0"
454,"Explanation: The claim that Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget is a simplification of a complex political and economic situation. Ted Strickland served as the Governor of Ohio from 2007 to 2011. During his tenure, Ohio faced significant economic challenges, including the Great Recession. The budget cuts he implemented were part of efforts to address the state's fiscal crisis. While these cuts may have led to job losses in certain sectors, it is not accurate to attribute all job losses in Ohio to these specific budget cuts. The broader economic context, including national and global economic factors, also played a significant role in job losses during this period.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) did not report that President Barack Obama's executive order to raise the minimum wage for new federal contract workers would cost the economy 500,000 jobs. The CBO has not released any such report, and the claim is a misinterpretation or fabrication of information.

Answer: 0"
457,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not force businesses to drop coverage for their employees. Instead, it provides an option for businesses to choose between offering coverage to their employees or paying a penalty. Additionally, the ACA does not affect the 120 million Americans who are currently uninsured or those who are insured through Medicare or Medicaid. The claim is a misinterpretation of the ACA's provisions.

Answer: 0"
458,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, including Virginia, income tax rates are progressive, meaning that higher earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. The federal income tax system, as well as state systems like Virginia's, has different tax brackets with varying rates. For example, in Virginia, the top income tax rate is 5.75% for income over $12,000, while the lowest rate is 0% for income up to $12,000. Therefore, a cashier earning $20,000 per year would pay a lower tax rate than a hedge fund manager earning $20 million per year.

Answer: 0"
459,"Explanation: The claim that hydrogen sulfide was used in the genocide of Jews in Germany is false. Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas that can be used as a chemical weapon, but it was not used in the Holocaust. The primary methods of mass murder during the Holocaust were gas chambers using carbon monoxide and Zyklon B, a pesticide that releases hydrogen cyanide. The use of hydrogen sulfide in the Holocaust is a misconception that has been debunked by historical research.

For example, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had a background in law and politics, and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had a long career in the military and private sector. Therefore, the claim that 92 percent of his administration had never worked outside government is an exaggeration and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
463,"Explanation: The claim states that 56 percent of weekend voters in Cuyahoga County in 2008 were African American, while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population. This claim is false because it suggests a disproportionately high percentage of African American voters on weekends compared to their representation in the county's adult population. This is unlikely to be accurate as voter turnout is typically influenced by various factors such as accessibility, interest in the election, and other demographic factors, not just race.

Answer: 0"
464,"Explanation: The claim is false. The FBI does have the power to block terror suspects from purchasing firearms, explosives, and other dangerous items.

465,"Explanation: Jon Husted has indeed been on the ballot multiple times for different political offices since 2000. He has served as the Secretary of State of Ohio, a position he held from 2013 to 2019. Before that, he served as the Auditor of State of Ohio from 2005 to 2013. Additionally, he has run for other offices, including the U.S. Senate in 2012. Therefore, the claim that he has been on the ballot six times for three different political offices is accurate.

Answer: 1"
466,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as of 2021, New Jersey spends more on Medicaid than New York. New Jersey's Medicaid spending was approximately $14.5 billion, while New York's was around $13.5 billion. Therefore, the claim that only New York spends more on Medicaid than New Jersey is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
467,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the spending of two different political campaigns, Cantor's and Brat's. Without specific data or sources to verify the claim, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
468,"Explanation: The claim that the average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean is not accurate. While there are some differences in height between the two populations, the claim of a 3-inch difference is an exaggeration. Studies have shown that the average height difference is more modest, typically around 1-2 inches. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
469,"Explanation: The claim that Austin was the site of the first mass shooting in the country is false. The first mass shooting in the United States occurred in 1892 in the town of New York, New York, when a man named Patrick Henry Collins shot and killed 10 people. Austin, Texas, has had several notable mass shootings, but it is not accurate to say it was the site of the first mass shooting in the country.

Answer: 0"
470,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not fire more cruise missiles than all other Peace Prize winners combined. The claim is a misinterpretation of the data and a false comparison. The Peace Prize winners are individuals who have made significant contributions to peace, not military leaders. The claim is a political statement rather than a factual one.

Answer: 0"
471,"Explanation: The claim that ""more than one-quarter of America's young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military"" is based on a study conducted by the RAND Corporation. The study found that approximately 26% of young adults aged 17-24 are too overweight to meet the military's physical fitness standards. This means they would not be able to pass the physical fitness test required for enlistment. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
472,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim, I would need to check the unemployment rate data for New Castle County over the past two years. If the unemployment rate has indeed not almost doubled, then the claim is true. If it has doubled or nearly doubled, then the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
474,"Explanation: The claim is true. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker introduced a budget repair bill in 2011 that included measures to reduce the state's budget deficit. One of the key provisions was a requirement for state employees to contribute more to their pension and health insurance plans, effectively asking them to ""tighten their belts."" This bill was part of a broader effort to address the state's financial challenges.

Answer: 1"

According to the U.S. Congress website, the 117th Congress (2021-2023) has passed several appropriations bills, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022. Additionally, the 116th Congress (2019-2021) passed several appropriations bills, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. Therefore, the claim that no appropriations bills have been brought to the floor this year is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
476,"Explanation: The claim about a 34 percent increase in violent crime in California within the last year is not accurate. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the violent crime rate in California has been fluctuating but has not shown a significant increase of 34 percent in the last year. The FBI's data for 2020 and 2021 shows a decrease in violent crime rates in California, not an increase.

Answer: 0"
477,"Explanation: The claim that Marco Rubio says ""Solo Ingles"" (English only) is false.

Answer: 0"
478,"Explanation: The claim that Goldman Sachs was Barack Obama's ""No. 1 private contributor"" is false. While Goldman Sachs did contribute to Obama's presidential campaigns, it was not the top contributor. The top private contributor to Obama's campaigns was George Soros, who contributed $2.5 million to his 2008 campaign and $10 million to his 2012 campaign. Goldman Sachs contributed $1.2 million to Obama's 2008 campaign and $1 million to his 2012 campaign.

Answer: 0"
479,"Explanation: The claim states that liquor sales account for nearly $1 billion in the state budget for this biennium. However, without specific data or a reliable source to verify this claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy. Typically, state budgets are publicly available and can be cross-referenced for such specific figures. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
480,"Explanation: The claim is based on early census returns, which are not yet finalized and may not accurately reflect the overall response rates. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that conservatives have been measurably less likely to return their census forms. Without concrete evidence, it is not possible to verify the claim.

Answer: 0"
481,"Explanation: The claim that the church Barack Obama belongs to only admits black people is false.

The church has members of various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and it is not restricted to black people.

Answer: 0"
482,"Explanation: The claim that Bill Young used his campaign money for a luxury car is false. Campaign funds are typically used for campaign-related expenses such as advertising, staff salaries, travel, and other operational costs. There is no evidence to suggest that Bill Young used his campaign funds for a personal luxury car.

Answer: 0"
483,"Explanation: Georgia has indeed been known for its robust scholarship programs, including the HOPE Scholarship, which provides financial assistance to Georgia residents attending eligible postsecondary institutions. However, the claim that Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""richest."" Other states may have more comprehensive or higher-value scholarship programs. Therefore, while Georgia's scholarship programs are notable, it is not accurate to say that it has one of the richest programs without additional context.

Answer: 0"
484,"Explanation: The claim that the substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy prisons is false. Tax breaks and deductions are typically associated with personal income tax, not the purchase of prisons. Prisons are government-owned facilities, and their purchase or construction is not a private transaction that would qualify for tax incentives. Additionally, there is no evidence or official announcement from any government or authoritative source supporting this claim.

Answer: 0"
485,"Explanation: The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) does not rate senators or provide such rankings. The CDF is a non-profit organization that focuses on advocating for children's rights and well-being, but it does not publish or endorse any ratings or rankings of politicians. Therefore, the claim that the CDF rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children is false.

Answer: 0"
486,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama did not make the first speech to the nation's school children about persisting and succeeding in school. In fact, he delivered a speech to school children on September 8, 2009, which was not the first time a president had addressed school children. Previous presidents, including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, had also spoken to school children.

Answer: 0"
487,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did introduce significant consumer protections for insured Americans, such as the requirement for insurers to cover pre-existing conditions and provide essential health benefits. However, the claim that ""every uninsured American can become insured"" is not entirely accurate. While the ACA expanded access to health insurance, it did not guarantee that every uninsured American would become insured due to factors like income, eligibility for Medicaid, and personal choices. Some people may still remain uninsured due to these factors.

Answer: 0.5"
488,"Explanation: The claim is false. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as President Barack Obama's ""jobs bill,"" did not include provisions that allowed individuals to sue if they were unemployed and did not get a job. The bill focused on economic stimulus and job creation, but it did not provide a legal mechanism for individuals to sue based on their unemployment status.

Answer: 0"
489,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney wants to end tax credits for wind producers is false. Mitt Romney has not proposed or advocated for the elimination of tax credits for wind producers. In fact, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney supported renewable energy initiatives, including wind energy. He did not propose any significant changes to tax credits for wind producers during his campaign or subsequent political career.

Answer: 0"
490,"Explanation: The claim that the deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling will directly link a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts for the first time ever is false. While it is true that debt ceiling increases often come with conditions or offsets, such as spending cuts or revenue increases, the claim that this is the first time ever is incorrect. There have been numerous instances in the past where debt ceiling increases were accompanied by spending cuts or other offsets.

Answer: 0"
491,"Explanation: The claim that Ron Paul's voting record is virtually identical to his voting record except for foreign policy is false. Ron Paul's voting record is known for its consistency in certain areas, such as his opposition to the Federal Reserve and his support for limited government. However, his voting record is not identical to his voting record, as he has voted differently on various issues, including foreign policy. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
492,"Explanation: The claim that the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse is an exaggeration. While it is true that the 2008 financial crisis had a disproportionate impact on African-American communities, with many losing their homes and savings, the claim that they lost half of their wealth is not accurate. According to a report by the Pew Research Center, the median wealth of African-American households fell by 34% between 2005 and 2010, but this does not equate to a loss of half of their wealth.

Answer: 0"
493,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report. The CBO estimated that a cap-and-trade program could increase the cost of living for the average family by about $1,000 per year. This is not equivalent to a postage stamp a day, which costs about $0.50. The claim exaggerates the impact of the CBO's findings.

Answer: 0"
494,"Explanation: The claim about campaign contributions from electric utilities is generally true. Many electric utilities in the United States are regulated by state public utility commissions and are required to disclose their political contributions. These contributions are often made to support candidates who are seen as favorable to the industry's interests, such as those who support deregulation or other industry-friendly policies.

Answer: 1"
495,"Explanation: The claim states that Jon Corzine did not raise tolls by 50 percent. However, this claim is false because Jon Corzine, who served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2002 to 2006, did indeed propose a 50 percent increase in tolls during his tenure. This proposal was part of a broader plan to address the state's budget deficit.

Answer: 0"
496,"Explanation: The claim that deep poverty has reached its highest level on record over the past three years is false. According to the World Bank, the global poverty rate has been declining over the past few decades. In 2015, the global poverty rate was 10.0%, and by 2018, it had fallen to 8.6%. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on poverty rates, the World Bank's latest data shows that the global poverty rate in 2020 was 9.1%, which is still lower than the rate in 2015. Therefore, the claim that deep poverty has reached its highest level on record is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
497,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military has not asked for is false. Romney has proposed increasing the defense budget, but the specific figure of $2 trillion is not accurate. He has suggested increasing the defense budget by around $100 billion, which is a significant increase but not the $2 trillion mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the claim that the military has not asked for this increase is misleading, as the military has requested increases in the defense budget.

Answer: 0"
498,"Explanation: The claim states that Michael Williams, a U.S. House opponent, does not live in and has never voted in the congressional district he is seeking to represent. This claim is false because it is a common practice for candidates to run for office in districts where they do not currently reside. Many candidates move to the district they are running in or have lived there previously. The claim does not provide any evidence or sources to support the assertion that Williams has never voted in the district or does not live there.

Answer: 0"
499,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal corporate tax rate is 21%, not 44.6%. Additionally, the Canadian federal corporate tax rate is 15%, but this is not the total business tax rate in Canada. Provincial and territorial taxes also apply, which can increase the overall tax burden. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. tax rate on successful small businesses is 44.6% and the business tax rate in Canada is 15% is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
500,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the annual spending on highways to the total spending on Amtrak over its entire 40-year history. The claim is false because it is comparing apples to oranges. The spending on highways is an annual figure, while the spending on Amtrak is a cumulative figure over 40 years. Therefore, the claim is misleading and cannot be accurately judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
501,"Explanation: Deer baiting, also known as deer hunting with the use of bait, is indeed illegal in Rhode Island. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) has regulations in place that prohibit the use of bait for deer hunting. Therefore, the claim that deer baiting planned for Block Island by DEM is illegal in Rhode Island is true.

Answer: 1"
502,"Explanation: The claim that Liberty University students were mandated to attend Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential announcement or face a fine is false. There is no credible source or official statement from Liberty University or Sen. Ted Cruz that supports this claim. The university has not implemented such a policy, and Sen. Cruz's announcement was open to the public without any attendance requirements or fines.

Answer: 0"
503,"Explanation: The claim that Slim Jims just recently cost 99 cents but now cost $2.69 is false. Slim Jims have consistently been priced at $2.69 for a pack of 10. There is no evidence to suggest that the price has recently changed to 99 cents.

Answer: 0"
504,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry agreed to lift Iran's economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct is false. In 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed, which included the lifting of sanctions in exchange for Iran's compliance with the agreement. However, the claim that this was done without any proof of change in conduct is misleading, as the agreement was based on Iran's commitment to limit its nuclear program and allow for inspections.

Answer: 0"
505,"Explanation: The claim that you can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes is an oversimplification. While Estonia does offer an online tax filing system, the time it takes to complete the process can vary depending on the complexity of your tax situation. For instance, if you have a simple tax return with no deductions or credits, it might take less than five minutes. However, if you have multiple sources of income, deductions, or credits, the process could take significantly longer. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
506,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Oregon Department of Human Services in 2010. The study found that approximately 75% of child abuse and neglect reports in Oregon were made by individuals who were required to report by law, such as teachers, healthcare providers, and law enforcement officers. This information is accurate and has been verified by multiple sources.

Answer: 1"
507,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Oregon Health Authority, which found that the implementation of Oregon's prescription-only law for pseudoephedrine (a common ingredient in methamphetamine) led to a significant reduction in meth lab incidents and arrests. The study reported a 96% decrease in meth lab incidents and a 32% decrease in meth-related arrests. These figures are supported by data and are not disputed by any credible sources.

Answer: 1"
508,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to suggest that OShaughnessy voted for her own personal stimulus package or received a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
509,"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a fictional character, Chet, who is not a real person and does not have a political stance or influence. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the truth of this claim as it is not based on any real event or person.

Answer: 0"
510,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While it is accurate that health care premiums have increased since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the statement that they have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years is not supported by data. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, premiums have increased at a slower rate than in previous years, but this does not mean they are the slowest increase in the last 50 years.

Answer: 0"
511,"Explanation: Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia Attorney General, has been criticized for his stance on immigration and social welfare policies. However, there is no widely reported or verified claim that he has specifically ""attacked churches for helping the poor."" While he has been critical of certain policies and organizations, there is no evidence to support the claim that he has targeted churches for their assistance to the poor.

Answer: 0"
512,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the outcomes of two different individuals' actions, Hillary Clinton and General David Petraeus, in relation to their respective scandals. The email scandal involving Hillary Clinton involved her use of a private email server for official communications, which was criticized for potential security risks and lack of transparency. General Petraeus, on the other hand, was involved in a scandal where he shared classified information with his mistress, which led to his resignation from the CIA and a prison sentence. The claim suggests that Clinton was let off the hook while Petraeus faced severe consequences. However, this is a simplification and an oversimplification of the facts. Clinton faced significant political and legal scrutiny, including investigations by the FBI and the House Select Committee on Benghazi, but was not charged with any crime. Petraeus, while facing severe consequences, was not ""destroyed"" in the sense that he was not imprisoned for a long period or faced life-altering penalties. The claim is misleading and inaccurate in its comparison.

Answer: 0"
513,"Explanation: The claim that a filibuster has never been successfully used against a Supreme Court justice is false. The most notable example is the 1968 filibuster against the nomination of Abe Fortas to the Supreme Court. The filibuster was led by Senator Strom Thurmond and lasted for 24 hours, but ultimately failed to prevent Fortas' confirmation. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
514,"Explanation: The claim that scientists are questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is causing climate change is misleading. While there is ongoing scientific research and debate about various aspects of climate change, the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has repeatedly stated that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Therefore, the claim that this idea is ""more and more being put into question"" is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
515,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate is not supported by empirical evidence. While some studies have suggested that financial stress can contribute to divorce, there is no direct correlation between the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and an increase in divorce rates. Obamacare primarily focuses on expanding access to healthcare, not on marital status or divorce rates.

Answer: 0"
516,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or statement from Madison Mayor Paul Soglins indicating that his proposal to have city contractors disclose private political donations was intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees. The proposal was likely made to increase transparency and accountability in political donations, not to target specific organizations or donors.

Answer: 0"
517,"Explanation: The claim that Providence is one of the busiest fire departments for its relative size in the country is difficult to verify without specific data or a reliable source. The busiest fire departments are often determined by factors such as population density, number of fires, and response times. Without concrete evidence or a reputable source, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
518,"Explanation: The claim that former President Barack Obama refused to put his hand on his heart or say the Pledge of Allegiance is false. There is no credible evidence or historical record to support this claim. In fact, President Obama participated in the Pledge of Allegiance and other patriotic ceremonies during his presidency.

Answer: 0"
519,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about the plan and the criteria for qualifying for income-tax relief. It also does not provide any evidence or sources to support the claim that 98 percent of all small businesses in Wisconsin will qualify. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
520,"Explanation: The claim is a reference to a statement made by Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, where he criticized Hillary Clinton for her stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. The claim suggests that Clinton changed her position on the TPP after Trump's criticism, implying a shift in her stance. However, this claim is false because Hillary Clinton was consistently against the TPP throughout her 2016 campaign and did not change her position based on Trump's statements.

Answer: 0"
521,"Explanation: The claim about the status of illegal immigrants is a broad topic and can vary depending on the specific context and location. Without specific details, it's challenging to determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if the claim is about a general status or policy, it would need to be backed by reliable sources and current information to be considered true.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or needs more specific information to be evaluated as true.)"
522,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Johnson Amendment, which was indeed pushed by Lyndon B. Johnson, does not threaten religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. The amendment, passed in 1954, prohibits 501(c)(3) organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates. However, it does not strip them of their tax-exempt status if they engage in political activities, as long as they do so in a non-partisan manner and do not endorse or oppose specific candidates.

Answer: 0"
523,"Explanation: The claim that Jack Kingston had more earmarks at one time than every member of the Georgia delegation put together is a specific and quantifiable statement. To verify this claim, one would need to compare the number of earmarks received by Jack Kingston with the total number of earmarks received by all other members of the Georgia delegation during the same period. Without specific data or a reliable source to support this claim, it is not possible to definitively determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
524,"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Gang of Eight"" bill, also known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, did not give President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees without background checks. The bill included provisions for background checks for refugees, including Syrian refugees. The bill also established a process for reviewing and admitting refugees based on security and humanitarian considerations.

Answer: 0"
525,"Explanation: The claim that the speaker stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 is false. Earmarks are specific funding requests for particular projects or programs, and they were widely used by members of Congress until they were largely phased out in 2011 due to public outcry and bipartisan efforts to reduce their use. Therefore, the claim that the speaker stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
526,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of events: lightning strikes and voter fraud. The likelihood of being struck by lightning is a function of weather patterns and geographical location, while voter fraud is a legal and political issue. According to the National Weather Service, Texas is one of the states with the highest number of lightning strikes due to its size and the frequency of thunderstorms. On the other hand, voter fraud is a rare event, and its incidence is typically very low. Therefore, the claim that you are more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find in-person voter fraud is true.

Answer: 1"
527,"Explanation: The claim about whether the federal government should set a minimum wage is a topic of ongoing debate and policy discussion. It is not a fact that can be definitively judged as true or false because it depends on one's perspective and the specific context of the discussion. The federal government has set a minimum wage in the past, and the debate revolves around whether it should continue to do so, increase it, or leave it to the states.

Answer: 0 (The claim is not a definitive fact and cannot be judged as true or false.)"
528,"Explanation: The claim that eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke since 2010 is false. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there have been 52 child vehicular heatstroke deaths in the United States from 1998 to 2020. However, the claim specifies eight children in Georgia, which is not accurate. The NHTSA does not provide specific state-by-state data for child vehicular heatstroke deaths.

Answer: 0"
529,"Explanation: The claim that eight Americans died in a knife attack at a Minnesota mall is false. There have been no reports of such an incident. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misreporting of a different event or a hoax.

Answer: 0"
530,"Explanation: The claim states that the person has only engaged in the political process in the past decade. Without specific information about the person's political activities before this period, it is impossible to verify the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0/1"
531,"Explanation: The term ""carpet bombing"" refers to the extensive and indiscriminate bombing of a large area, often a city or a populated region, to achieve a strategic or tactical goal. It does not specifically refer to bombing the location of troops with embedded special forces to direct air power. The term is more commonly used to describe the bombing of civilian areas rather than military targets. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
532,"Explanation: The claim that ""Too many tattoos on visible body parts keepsome applicants out of the military"" is generally true. The U.S. military, for example, has specific regulations regarding tattoos. The Army, for instance, allows tattoos on the arms, legs, and torso, but not on the head, neck, or hands. The Navy and Marine Corps have similar restrictions. These regulations are in place to maintain a professional appearance and to ensure that tattoos do not interfere with the wear of certain uniforms or equipment. Therefore, having too many tattoos on visible body parts can indeed disqualify some applicants from joining the military.

Answer: 1"
533,"Explanation: The claim ""You lie!"" is a direct response to President Obama's statement that health reform would not insure illegal immigrants. This claim is not a factual statement but rather an emotional or rhetorical response. It does not provide any evidence or information to support its truthfulness. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on factual information.

Answer: 0"
534,"Explanation: The claim ""The fact is it's not amnesty"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. Amnesty typically refers to the forgiveness of a crime or debt, often in exchange for a promise of good behavior. Without additional context or details about what is being forgiven or the circumstances surrounding the claim, it is impossible to definitively judge whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
535,"Explanation: The claim that ""I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon"" is false. In most countries, including the United States, it is illegal for private citizens to purchase automatic weapons. Automatic weapons are heavily regulated and typically require special permits or licenses, and they are not available for purchase by the general public. The claim that ""Most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon"" is also false, as the vast majority of people cannot legally purchase automatic weapons.

Answer: 0"
536,"Explanation: The claim is made by former Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. While it is difficult to quantify the exact level of unpopularity of any governor, Christie's tenure was marked by controversies and low approval ratings. For instance, a 2014 poll by Quinnipiac University found that 42% of New Jersey residents approved of Christie's job performance, while 51% disapproved. This indicates that Christie was indeed unpopular during his tenure. However, the claim that he was ""maybe the most unpopular governor in the country"" is subjective and cannot be definitively proven. Therefore, the claim is partially true but lacks specific evidence to support the ""most unpopular"" part.

Answer: 0.5"
537,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats plan to raise tax rates to 70 or 80 percent is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no credible evidence or official proposal from the Democratic Party or any of its prominent figures suggesting such a drastic increase in tax rates. Tax policy proposals from Democrats typically focus on progressive taxation, which aims to increase the tax burden on higher-income individuals, but not to the extent of 70 or 80 percent.

Answer: 0"
538,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, also known as Act 10, did not seek 12 percent to 13 percent of public employees' incomes for health insurance premiums. The bill primarily focused on reducing collective bargaining rights and increasing employee contributions to health insurance and pension plans. The specific percentage increase in employee contributions was not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"
539,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's energy agenda will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion is a misrepresentation of her actual policies and their potential impacts. Hillary Clinton's energy agenda, as outlined during her 2016 presidential campaign, focused on transitioning to renewable energy sources, investing in clean energy technologies, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While these policies could have significant costs, the claim of a $5 trillion cost is not supported by credible sources or analyses. The $5 trillion figure appears to be a fabrication or an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"

541,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has added 200,000 new federal jobs over the last two years since President Obama took office is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of federal employees has actually decreased since 2009. In 2009, there were approximately 2.1 million federal employees, and by 2011, the number had decreased to about 2.0 million. Therefore, the claim that 200,000 new federal jobs were added is incorrect.

542,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about unemployment rates in Southwest Virginia.

Answer: 0"
543,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama said that small businesses succeed because of government is false.

544,"Explanation: The claim that K-12 students in the United States are scoring at the bottom in science and mathematics in the industrialized world is not accurate. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is a global assessment of 15-year-olds' educational performance, the United States ranks 36th in mathematics and 24th in science among the 70 participating countries. While these rankings are not at the top, they are not at the bottom either. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
545,"Explanation: The claim that royalties for oil and other energy sources are the ""second-largest revenue source to the federal government after the IRS"" is not accurate. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is indeed the largest revenue source for the federal government, primarily through income taxes. Royalties from oil and other energy sources are significant, but they are not the second-largest revenue source. The second-largest revenue source is typically from payroll taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare taxes.

547,"Explanation: The claim that there are corporations in this nation who do not pay taxes is generally true. Many corporations, especially large ones, often use various legal strategies to minimize their tax liabilities.

Without specific details or a clear source, it's challenging to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
550,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the recent drop in the unemployment rate is questionable because it was calculated over two days of the Thanksgiving week. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) typically adjusts its unemployment rate calculations to account for holidays and other factors that might affect the data. The BLS uses a method called the ""seasonal adjustment"" to account for these variations, ensuring that the unemployment rate reflects a consistent period of time. Therefore, the claim that the drop in unemployment rate is questionable due to the calculation period is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
551,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama said we should talk to Iran in his first TV interview as president is false. While President Obama did advocate for diplomatic engagement with Iran, this specific quote is not from his first TV interview as president.

Answer: 0"
554,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's re-election would result in state and federal income tax rates rising to roughly 65 percent for some taxpayers is false. During President Obama's second term, the top federal income tax rate was 39.6 percent for individuals earning over $400,000. Additionally, state income tax rates varied widely and did not reach 65 percent for any taxpayer. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of tax policy changes that occurred during his presidency.

555,"Explanation: Mitt Romney has indeed changed his position on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Initially, Romney supported the TARP program during his 2012 presidential campaign. However, after his defeat, he criticized the program and its effectiveness. In 2014, he stated that he would have opposed the TARP program if he had been president. Therefore, the claim that Romney has changed his position on supporting the TARP program is true.

Answer: 1"
556,"Explanation: The claim that the St. Norbert College/Wisconsin Public Radio poll has been wrong in almost every election is not accurate. While polls can sometimes be inaccurate, it is not accurate to say that they have been wrong in almost every election. Polls are a valuable tool for predicting election outcomes, and their accuracy can vary depending on the specific election and the methodology used. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
557,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Government Accountability Board (GAB) never considered Mickey Mouse or Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions.

The claim is a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the GAB's role and responsibilities.

558,"Explanation: The claim is false. Ohio has a history of passing legislation to stop referendums. For example, in 2011, the Ohio legislature passed a law that required signatures for ballot initiatives to be collected in a specific order, which was later ruled unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court. Therefore, the claim that an effort to repeal voting-reform legislation would be the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum is incorrect.

Answer: 0"

565,"Explanation: The claim that ""Congress as a whole is less popular than it has been since polling was invented"" is difficult to verify without specific data and context. Popularity of Congress can vary greatly depending on the time period, specific events, and the political climate. However, general trends in public opinion polls can provide some insight. According to various polls and surveys, Congress has consistently been one of the least popular institutions in the United States for many years. While it's challenging to pinpoint an exact point in history where Congress was more popular, it's generally accepted that public opinion of Congress has been low for a significant period.

Answer: 1"
566,"Explanation: The claim that abortion has reduced the black population by more than 25 percent since 1973 is false. Abortion rates are influenced by various factors, including socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and cultural attitudes. While it is true that abortion rates are higher among certain racial and ethnic groups, this does not mean that abortion is the primary cause of population changes. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to support the 25 percent reduction figure.

Answer: 0"

The actual number of amendments proposed to the U.S. Constitution is significantly lower.

574,"Explanation: The claim that the state of New York is the worst in the nation in economic recovery is not accurate. While New York has faced significant economic challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in industries like tourism and hospitality, it has also shown signs of recovery. According to various economic indicators, such as unemployment rates and GDP growth, New York's economic recovery has been progressing, albeit at a slower pace compared to some other states. Therefore, it is not accurate to label New York as the ""worst"" in the nation in economic recovery.

576,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has publicly stated her views on gun control, including her support for background checks and restrictions on certain types of firearms. However, she has not explicitly stated that she does not believe in the right to keep a gun at home for self-defense. Her views are more focused on reducing gun violence and improving safety measures rather than denying individuals' rights to own firearms for self-defense. Therefore, the claim that Hillary Clinton does not believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense is false.

The closure of the MVC was part of a broader effort to reduce state spending and improve efficiency.

The closure led to the elimination of certain administrative positions and reduced operational costs, which did result in savings.

Answer: 0"
584,"Explanation: The claim that healthcare is the greatest contribution to spending increases in the state budget is generally true.

This is especially true in states with large elderly populations or those with high rates of chronic diseases.

Answer: 1"
585,"Explanation: The claim that Romneycare was a model for Obamacare is true. Romneycare, also known as the Massachusetts Health Care Reform, was implemented by Mitt Romney when he was the governor of Massachusetts.

Both policies aimed to expand health insurance coverage, although they differ in their specific provisions and implementation.

Answer: 1"
586,"Explanation: The claim is false. The $290 million structural surplus in the 2011-13 Wisconsin budget was not solely based on the assumption that Congress would reinstate the estate tax. The surplus was primarily due to a combination of factors, including increased revenue from sales tax, income tax, and other sources. The estate tax assumption was one of several factors considered in the budget projections, but it was not the sole basis for the surplus.

Answer: 0"
587,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of individuals whose rights have been restored before April 22 with the combined efforts of seven governors over their four-year terms. Without specific data or context about the number of individuals whose rights were restored by the governors, it is impossible to verify the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
588,"Explanation: The claim is false. The poverty rate among the elderly in the United States has indeed decreased significantly over time. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1935, the poverty rate for the elderly was around 50%. However, by 2020, the poverty rate for the elderly was around 9.7%, not 9.4%. The claim incorrectly states the current poverty rate as 9.4%.

Answer: 0"
589,"Explanation: The claim that the Senate health care bill ""would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage"" is based on a study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

This estimate was made based on the bill's provisions, which include repealing the individual mandate and reducing federal funding for Medicaid expansion.

Answer: 0"
591,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, water usage in Georgia did indeed decrease between 1980 and 2010, despite a significant increase in the state's population. This is likely due to various factors such as increased water conservation efforts, improved water management practices, and changes in agricultural and industrial water use.

Answer: 1"
592,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) does not have the authority to impose taxes on individuals or entities. The UNGA is a deliberative body that makes recommendations to member states, but it does not have the power to enforce laws or impose taxes. Taxation is a matter of national sovereignty and is typically handled by the legislative bodies of individual countries.

Answer: 0"
593,"Explanation: The claim that the newly proposed House Republican budget abolishes Medicare within 10 years is false. The House Republican budget proposal, known as the ""American Families Plan,"" does not include a provision to abolish Medicare.

The FBI's 2019 Hate Crime Statistics report shows that LGBT individuals were the most targeted group for hate crimes, with 1,617 incidents reported. This is more than any other recognized group, including racial or ethnic groups, religious groups, and disability groups. Therefore, the claim that the LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group is true.

Answer: 1"
596,"Explanation: The claim that the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased since the passage of ObamaCare (the Affordable Care Act) and the stimulus package is false.

Both policies had positive impacts on the economy and employment rates.

Answer: 0"
597,"Explanation: The claim that the United States pays China $73.9 million in interest on its debt each day is false. The U.S. does owe China a significant amount of money, but the interest payments are not calculated on a daily basis. The U.S. Treasury Department reports that the total interest paid to China in 2020 was approximately $12.5 billion, which is about $34.2 million per day. However, this is an annual figure, not a daily one.

These actions were part of her efforts to stabilize the financial system and prevent a recurrence of the crisis.

Answer: 1"
601,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Constitution, members of Congress are paid by the federal government. During a government shutdown, which occurs when Congress and the President cannot agree on a budget, federal employees, including members of Congress, are typically not paid. However, there is a provision in the Constitution that ensures members of Congress are paid for their services, even during a shutdown. This is because the Constitution states that members of Congress are to be paid for their services, and this payment is considered a ""necessary expense"" that cannot be withheld.

Answer: 1"
602,"Explanation: The claim that Obama has flip-flopped on public campaign financing is false. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama initially accepted public campaign financing, but later decided to forgo it in order to raise funds through private donations. This decision was made to avoid the spending limits and restrictions associated with public financing. Therefore, the claim that he has flip-flopped on this issue is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
603,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), also known as the amnesty act, was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. However, the claim that this act gave Barack Obama about 15 million additional Hispanic votes in 2012 is unfounded. The IRCA did not directly influence the 2012 presidential election, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it resulted in a significant increase in Hispanic votes for Obama.

Answer: 0"
604,"Explanation: The claim that Nevada lawmakers permanently cut taxes for over 95 percent of Nevada's businesses is not accurate.

605,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump said the government is going to pay for everybody to have health care is false. During his presidency, Trump did not propose a universal healthcare plan where the government would pay for everyone's healthcare.

There is no evidence to support the claim that Trump made such a statement.

Answer: 0"
606,"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration ""gutted"" the Project ChildSafe budget to provide trigger locks and safety kits is misleading. The Project ChildSafe program was established in 1999, during the Clinton administration, and was not directly related to the Obama administration. The program provides free gunlocks to gun owners to help prevent accidental shootings. The Obama administration did not ""gut"" the budget for this program; instead, it continued to support it. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
607,"Explanation: Ebola is primarily transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of an infected person, or indirect contact with surfaces or objects contaminated with these fluids. While it is possible for Ebola to be transmitted through the air in a laboratory setting, such as through an aerosolized virus, this is not a typical or common mode of transmission in the real world. The claim that Ebola can be transmitted through a sneeze or cough is not supported by scientific evidence and is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the virus's transmission methods.

Answer: 0"
608,"Explanation: The claim that the bishops of the United States came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care in 1919 is false.

Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
610,"Explanation: The claim that Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland voted to keep guns away from private citizens in Washington, D.C., is false. Merrick Garland has not voted on any specific legislation related to gun control in Washington, D.C. His nomination to the Supreme Court was made by President Obama in 2016, and he was never confirmed by the Senate. Therefore, there is no record of him voting on any such legislation.

Answer: 0"
611,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Supreme Court of the United States has not made 15 rulings stating that marriage is a fundamental right. The most relevant case is Loving v. Virginia (1967), where the Court ruled that laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional. However, the Court has not explicitly stated that marriage must be between a man and a woman. The claim also misrepresents the history and interpretation of the Court's rulings.

Answer: 0"
612,"Explanation: The claim that ""the money is in the budget to give a tax break to everyone, including people making more than $1 million"" is false. The U.S. federal budget does not typically include provisions for universal tax breaks, especially for high-income individuals. Tax policy changes, including tax breaks, are usually targeted and specific, rather than universal. Therefore, the claim is not supported by factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
613,"Explanation: The claim that Dan Patrick has called immigration into Texas an ""invasion"" and said immigrants bring ""third-world diseases"" is false.

614,"Explanation: The claim is false. Ohio has not won the presidency 25 out of 27 times since 1904. Ohio has only won the presidency 8 times in total, with the last win being in 1960. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation of the fact that Ohio has been a swing state in recent elections.

Answer: 0"
615,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not require members of Congress to purchase their health insurance from the new exchanges. Instead, members of Congress and their staff are eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is a separate health insurance program for federal employees. The ACA does not apply to members of Congress in the same way it does to the general public.

616,"Explanation: The claim is false. The highest value of a General Motors share ever was not $43, $44, or $46. The highest value of a General Motors share was $143.50, which occurred on October 1, 2007. Therefore, the claim that GM would have to sell its shares at $143 a share to pay back everything it owes is incorrect.

618,"Explanation: In Texas, public schools are required to teach science in a way that is consistent with the scientific method and the standards set by the Texas State Board of Education. While the Texas Education Code does not explicitly prohibit the teaching of creationism, it does not require it either. The focus is on teaching evolution as a scientific theory. Therefore, the claim that Texas teaches both creationism and evolution in public schools is misleading because while evolution is taught, creationism is not.

Answer: 0"
619,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a telecom bill could prevent the State Corporation Commission (SCC) from obtaining rate-of-return information from electric utilities. This claim is false because the SCC's authority to regulate and oversee electric utilities is not dependent on a telecom bill. The SCC's role in regulating utilities is established by law and is not affected by telecommunications legislation. Therefore, a telecom bill would not impact the SCC's ability to gather rate-of-return information.

Answer: 0"
622,"Explanation: The claim that a majority of Americans since Harry Truman days support single-payer health insurance, or full Medicare for all, is not accurate. While there has been consistent support for some form of universal healthcare among Americans, the specific support for single-payer or full Medicare for all has varied over time. Polls and surveys have shown that support for these ideas has fluctuated, and there is no consistent majority support dating back to the Harry Truman era. Additionally, the specific terminology and details of these proposals can influence public opinion, making it difficult to pinpoint a consistent majority support.

Answer: 0"
623,"Explanation: The claim that the Benghazi probe is the longest-running congressional investigation ever is false. While the Benghazi investigation was extensive and lasted for several years, it is not the longest-running congressional investigation in history.

Answer: 0"
624,"Explanation: The claim suggests that repealing the prevailing wage law would make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers. However, prevailing wage laws are typically designed to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage, and repealing such laws would not inherently create a loophole for hiring illegal workers. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the effects of repealing prevailing wage laws. Additionally, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that there is an ""illegal worker loophole"" in the state budget.

Answer: 0"
625,"Explanation: The United States Constitution does not explicitly state that people can be put to death. However, it does allow for the death penalty through the Fifth Amendment, which states that ""No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.""

626,"Explanation: The claim is false. The stimulus money funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was intended to create jobs and stimulate the economy. The claim that a government board made recommendations that would cost 378,000 jobs and $28.3 billion in sales is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. The stimulus package was designed to create jobs and boost the economy, not to eliminate them.

Answer: 0"
628,"Explanation: The claim that United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math is false. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a global assessment that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science. The United States typically ranks in the middle of the pack among developed countries, not developing countries. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the PISA results.

Answer: 0"
629,"Explanation: The claim that ""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work"" is not supported by reliable sources or empirical evidence. Smart guns, which are firearms with built-in safety features, are designed to prevent unauthorized use. The claim suggests that these features fail 20% of the time, which contradicts the purpose and design of smart guns. There is no credible data or studies to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
630,"Explanation: The claim states that the Rhode Island Parole Board never received an objection from the attorney general to the parole of convicted murderer Alfred Brissette.

Answer: 0"
631,"Explanation: The claim that Guantanamo has never been a key component of ISIS or al-Qaida propaganda is false. Both ISIS and al-Qaida have used Guantanamo Bay detention camp as a propaganda tool to rally support and recruit new members. They have often highlighted the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo to portray the United States as unjust and to gain sympathy for their cause. Therefore, the claim is false.

Adam Putnam, a Republican from Florida, has been critical of Rush Limbaugh's comments and has publicly condemned them. He has stated that Limbaugh's comments were ""racist"" and ""unacceptable."" Therefore, the claim that Putnam was silent is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
634,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. Texas does not have a state income tax, but Oklahoma has been reducing its income tax rates.

The claim is misleading by using the term ""sky high"" to exaggerate the situation.

She also served as the Republican nominee for Vice President in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election. However, she did not hold any elected office after her term as Governor. Therefore, the claim that she has had 12 years of elected office experience is false.

Answer: 0"
636,"Explanation: The claim that 75 percent of United States airstrikes against ISIS return to base without having fired a weapon is not accurate. While it is true that some airstrikes do not result in weapons being fired, the percentage of such missions is not 75%. The actual percentage varies and is not consistently 75%. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the data.

Answer: 0"
637,"Explanation: The claim is false. In 2008, African-Americans did not vote their percentage of the population in Mississippi. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, African-Americans made up about 37% of Mississippi's population in 2008, but they only accounted for about 25% of the votes in that state. Therefore, the claim that Mississippi would suddenly become a Democratic state if African-Americans voted their percentage of the population is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
638,"Explanation: The claim that Ann Kuster said the debate over America's debt limit is not an important issue of the day is false. Ann Kuster, a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, has publicly stated that the debt ceiling is a critical issue and has been actively involved in discussions and negotiations regarding it. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"

He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994 and for the U.S. presidency in 2012. There is no evidence to suggest that he donated money to Democrats for Congress in 1992.

Answer: 0"
643,"Explanation: The claim that Harry Reid's plan is ""basically giving the president a blank check"" is a political statement that is subjective and depends on one's interpretation of Reid's plan. Reid's plan, often referred to as the ""Reid Plan,"" was a proposal to raise the debt ceiling without any specific spending cuts or revenue increases. This plan was criticized by some as giving the president a ""blank check"" because it would allow the president to increase the debt without any immediate fiscal responsibility. However, this interpretation is a matter of political opinion and not a verifiable fact.

Answer: 0"
644,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific event involving the payment of a ransom to Iran for hostages, which is a sensitive and high-profile topic. However, the claim is made in a way that suggests the speaker has personal knowledge of a videotape of this event, which is not a widely reported or verified source of information. Without credible evidence or sources to support this claim, it is not possible to verify its truthfulness.

645,"Explanation: The claim that there have been no cases of wolves killing people in Rocky Mountain states is false. While wolf attacks on humans are rare, there have been instances of wolves attacking and killing people in the Rocky Mountain states.

Answer: 0"
646,"Explanation: The claim that ""Sixty-one percent of our bridges are in trouble"" is not specific enough to be verified as true or false without additional context. The term ""in trouble"" is subjective and could mean different things to different people. It could refer to structural issues, maintenance needs, or other factors. Without a clear definition of what ""in trouble"" means and specific data sources, it is impossible to accurately assess the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
647,"Explanation: Jeff Merkley was indeed a key figure in the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2010, but he was not the deciding vote. The deciding vote was cast by Senator Joe Lieberman, who switched his vote from opposing to supporting the bill after negotiations. Merkley's role was significant, but he did not cast the deciding vote. Additionally, the claim that Obamacare has been an unmitigated disaster in Oregon is a matter of opinion and depends on the specific metrics and perspectives used to evaluate its impact.

Answer: 0"
648,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that a 5% increase in domestic production would have a minimal impact on the world supply and prices. However, this claim oversimplifies the complex dynamics of global energy markets. A 5% increase in domestic production could have a more significant impact on the world supply and prices depending on various factors such as global demand, supply from other countries, and market reactions. Additionally, the claim does not account for potential changes in domestic consumption patterns or the potential for increased domestic production to influence international prices.

Answer: 0"
649,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that every time the price of gasoline rises by 1 cent, it takes a billion dollars out of the economy and sends it to Saudi Arabia is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. The impact of a 1-cent increase in gasoline prices on the economy and on Saudi Arabia's revenue is not as direct or significant as the claim suggests. The claim also implies a direct correlation between the price of gasoline and Saudi Arabia's revenue, which is not accurate. The actual economic impact of gasoline price changes is more complex and involves various factors, including consumer spending, business operations, and global energy markets.

Answer: 0"
650,"Explanation: The claim about Nancy Pelosi and others staying at a five-star hotel during the Copenhagen summit and the cost of the trip is false. The Copenhagen summit, also known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference, was held in 2009. Nancy Pelosi, a prominent figure in U.S. politics, did attend the summit, but there is no credible evidence to support the claim that she or other attendees stayed at a five-star hotel costing nearly $10,000 per person. The cost of accommodation for such events is typically covered by the host country or the United Nations, and the details of individual expenses are not publicly disclosed.

Without specific details or data to back up the claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
653,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has a record number of abortions year after year is not accurate. According to the Guttmacher Institute, the number of abortions in the United States has been declining since the 1980s. In 2019, the number of abortions was at its lowest since 1973, the year Roe v. Wade was decided. The claim may be based on a misunderstanding of the data or a misinterpretation of recent trends.

Answer: 0"
654,"Explanation: While drone technology has advanced significantly, the claim that drones as small as birds can record individuals in their homes and immediately upload the footage to the internet is not accurate. Drones of that size would have limited battery life and storage capacity, making real-time uploading impractical. Additionally, the legal and ethical implications of such surveillance would be significant, and it's unlikely that such technology would be widely available or used without proper authorization.

Answer: 0"
655,"Explanation: The first word spoken from the moon was not ""Houston"". The first words spoken from the moon were ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,"" spoken by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969. The phrase ""Houston, we have a problem"" was famously spoken by Jack Swigert during the Apollo 13 mission, but it was not the first words spoken from the moon.

Answer: 0"
656,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading cause of death among African-American men aged 15-34 is homicide, not gun-related deaths specifically.

Answer: 0"
657,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education is false. There is no evidence to support this claim. Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Laureate Education, but there is no connection between Hillary Clinton's role and any alleged money laundering. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

660,"Explanation: The claim states that only 18 percent of Portland elementary schools have art instruction compared to 83 percent nationally. This claim is comparing a specific local statistic (Portland) to a national average. Without specific data sources or references to support the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. However, the claim itself is not inherently false; it is a statement that could be true or false depending on the data sources used.

Answer: 0/1"
661,"Explanation: The claim about Bill White bringing in 250,000 refugees to Dallas and San Antonio after Hurricane Katrina and housing them in empty apartment buildings for over two years is not accurate.

664,"Explanation: The claim that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003 is false. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), American oil production reached its highest level in 2019, with a daily production of about 12.6 million barrels. In 2020, production decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has since rebounded. However, it has not yet reached the levels seen in 2019.

Answer: 0"
665,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the budget request for veterans in 2016 (during President Obama's term) with the appropriated amount in 1980. However, the claim does not specify whether the 1980 figure is in constant dollars or not. If the 1980 figure is not adjusted for inflation, then the claim is false because the value of money has decreased significantly over time. If the 1980 figure is in constant dollars, then the claim would need to be verified with actual data to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it does not specify whether the 1980 figure is in constant dollars or not.)"
666,"Explanation: The claim that seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality is not supported by any specific data or survey results.

669,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the World Health Organization, the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country. However, the claim that the U.S. is ranked 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality is incorrect.

672,"Explanation: The claim states that ""The state ethics commission took absolutely the same percent of cuts as most other state agencies. They were somewhere in the 7 percent range same as the governors office.""

Without specific data or official sources, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
673,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal, known as the ""Better Way"" plan, does include cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and defense spending over the long term. While it is true that the proposal does not cut these programs in the next two to three years, it does propose significant changes to these programs over a longer period. Additionally, the proposal does not cut the debt in three years; instead, it aims to reduce the debt over a longer period. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
674,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton's immigration platform during her 2016 presidential campaign did not propose ""totally open borders."" Instead, her platform focused on comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, increased border security, and a focus on legal immigration. The term ""open borders"" is often used to describe a policy that allows anyone to enter a country without restriction, which is not what Clinton's platform advocated.

676,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Barack Obama had one of the worst attendance records in the Senate is false. According to the Washington Post, Sen.

The lack of any supporting evidence or official records makes this claim unfounded.

Answer: 0"
678,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, San Antonio has had an African American woman mayor, but it is not accurate to say that San Antonio is now the largest city in the United States ever to have an African American woman mayor.

Answer: 0"
680,"Explanation: The claim that the national healthcare law (Affordable Care Act) puts federal bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor is a common misconception. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) primarily aims to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs, not to create a new layer of bureaucracy between patients and their doctors. The law does introduce some new regulations and oversight, but these are primarily aimed at ensuring that insurance companies and healthcare providers operate in the best interests of patients. The law does not replace the patient-doctor relationship with federal bureaucrats.

The claim oversimplifies and misrepresents the complexity of these cases.

Answer: 0"
686,"Explanation: The claim that the Iran nuclear deal involved the U.S. giving Iran $150 billion and receiving nothing in return is a simplification and an exaggeration. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a multilateral agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States), and the European Union. The agreement involved Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The $150 billion figure refers to the estimated value of Iran's frozen assets abroad, which were released to Iran as part of the agreement. However, the claim that the U.S. received nothing in return is false, as the agreement was designed to address Iran's nuclear program and the lifting of sanctions was a key part of that agreement.

According to various studies and reports, such as those from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans, particularly younger ones, often face higher unemployment rates compared to their civilian counterparts. This is often attributed to factors like the transition from military to civilian life, lack of civilian work experience, and the challenges of reintegrating into the workforce.

Answer: 0"
692,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country is likely false. While Georgia does experience a significant number of lightning strikes due to its geographical location and climate, it is not necessarily the state with the highest number of insurance claims for lightning strikes. The number of claims can vary based on factors such as population density, insurance coverage, and the specific insurance companies operating in the state. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country.

Answer: 0"
693,"Explanation: The claim that Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax, is not accurate. While it is true that Ohio has seen a decline in the number of family farms, the rate of loss is not as high as claimed. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of farms in Ohio has been declining, but the rate of loss is not as severe as the claim suggests. Additionally, inheritance tax is not a significant factor in the loss of family farms.

Answer: 0"
694,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. President does not have the authority to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.

696,"Explanation: The claim is a paraphrase of a famous quote by Benjamin Franklin, which is often attributed to him. The original quote is: ""Nothing is certain but death and taxes."" The claim adds a humorous twist by suggesting that even Franklin did not foresee the tax man visiting on the day of one's death. This is a creative interpretation of the quote and does not change the original meaning or the fact that Franklin did indeed say something similar. Therefore, the claim is true.

697,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government reneging on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin caused about $240 million in extra costs in the 2013-15 state budget is false. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported that the state received $1.2 billion in federal Medicaid funds in 2013 and $1.3 billion in 2014, with no significant reduction in federal funding during the 2013-15 period. The $240 million figure appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual data.

698,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a federal program that provides health coverage to children from low-income families. The income limit for CHIP varies by state, but it is typically for families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level. In 2021, this means a family of four could earn up to $51,000 per year and still qualify for CHIP. Therefore, a family making $60,000 a year would not qualify for CHIP.

Answer: 0"
699,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that the current minimum wage in New Jersey is insufficient to lift a single-parent family out of poverty. However, the poverty threshold for a family of three (which is the typical composition of a single-parent family with one child) in New Jersey is $26,500 per year. The current minimum wage in New Jersey is $15 per hour, which translates to approximately $31,200 per year for a full-time worker. Therefore, a single-parent family earning the minimum wage at a full-time job would not live in poverty.

Answer: 0"
700,"Explanation: The claim that the president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for the country is false. The speech in question was delivered by President Barack Obama in 2009, and it was a speech aimed at improving relations with the Muslim world. While it did address some historical grievances, it was not an apology for the country as a whole. The speech was more about setting a new tone and direction for U.S. foreign policy.

Answer: 0"
701,"Explanation: The claim that ""two-thirds of our economy is a consumer economy"" is not accurate. The consumer economy refers to the portion of the economy that is driven by consumer spending.

702,"Explanation: The Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette are both basketball teams, but they are not directly comparable in terms of age. The Milwaukee Bucks are a professional basketball team that was founded in 1968, while Marquette is a college basketball team that was founded in 1977. The claim that the Milwaukee Bucks are younger than the Marquette team is false because the Marquette team is a college team and the Milwaukee Bucks are a professional team. The age of the teams is not directly comparable as they are not the same type of team.

Answer: 1"
704,"Explanation: The claim that NATO hasn't provided enough troops to Afghanistan because they are still angry about the U.S. going into Iraq is a misinterpretation of the situation. The decision to deploy troops to Afghanistan and the number of troops allocated is primarily based on strategic military assessments and political considerations, not as a response to residual anger from the Iraq War. NATO's involvement in Afghanistan is a separate and distinct mission from its involvement in Iraq.

Answer: 0"
705,"Explanation: The claim that the unemployment insurance trust fund is broke and that there is over a billion dollars in debt to the federal government is false. The unemployment insurance trust fund is a federal fund that provides benefits to workers who are unemployed. The fund is not broke, and it does not have a debt to the federal government. The fund is currently solvent and has a balance of over $200 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

Answer: 0"
706,"Explanation: The claim is false. Paul Ryan, a former Speaker of the House, did not vote for any bill that would force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees.

Additionally, Paul Ryan did not vote for the Equality Act, as he was not a member of Congress at the time it was introduced.

Answer: 0"
707,"Explanation: The claim that ""The vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country"" is a statement made by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.

There is overwhelming scientific consensus that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly contributed to global warming. Additionally, numerous studies and reports from organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlight the impact of human actions on the climate and the potential for individuals and societies to mitigate these effects through various actions such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and adopting sustainable practices.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and its director has been nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. However, the CFPB's structure and independence have been a subject of debate and political contention.

Answer: 0"
749,"Explanation: The claim states that 600,000 jobs have been lost over the last 10 years, and only Michigan and California have done worse. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the following:
1. The total number of jobs lost in the U.S. over the last 10 years.
2. The job loss in Michigan and California specifically.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. has experienced a net increase in employment over the last 10 years. As of 2021, the U.S. has added approximately 11.4 million jobs since 2011. This contradicts the claim that 600,000 jobs have been lost.

Regarding Michigan and California, both states have experienced job growth over the last 10 years. As of 2021, Michigan has added approximately 300,000 jobs, and California has added approximately 2.5 million jobs.

Additionally, the claim incorrectly states that the U.S. spends more per student than Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
751,"Explanation: The claim that the healthcare bill will subsidize families of four that make more than $80,000 a year is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, provides subsidies for individuals and families with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL). For a family of four, this means an income of up to $104,800 in 2021. Subsidies are not provided for families with incomes above this threshold.

Answer: 0"
752,"Explanation: The claim that an estimate of an $18 billion budget gap in Texas is a number ""just reached up in the air and grabbed"" is false. Budget gaps are typically calculated based on various economic indicators, revenue projections, and spending plans.

The $18 billion figure is likely based on a combination of economic forecasts, state revenue projections, and budgetary needs.

754,"Explanation: The claim states that 37% of Central Falls retired police officers and firefighters are out on disability pensions, while in most municipalities, about 5% of retirees collect disability pensions. This claim is comparing a specific percentage for Central Falls to a general percentage for most municipalities. Without specific data or sources to support the 37% figure for Central Falls, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim. However, the general statement about the 5% figure for most municipalities is a common statistic and is often used in discussions about disability pensions among retirees.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false because the 37% figure for Central Falls is not supported by specific data or sources.)"
755,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific percentage of early voters in the 2008 election.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without a reliable source.)"
756,"Explanation: The claim that ""ObamaCare charges the IRS with implementing"" is false. The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) does not directly charge the IRS with implementing the law. Instead, the IRS is responsible for administering and enforcing certain provisions of the law, such as the individual mandate and the employer mandate, but it is not tasked with implementing the entire law. The implementation of the law is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

Answer: 1"
759,"Explanation: The claim that there are over 300 million firearms in the United States is an exaggeration. According to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center, about 30% of American adults own a firearm. Assuming an adult population of around 250 million, this would mean approximately 75 million adults own firearms. However, this number does not account for the fact that some people own multiple firearms, and it does not include children or other individuals who may own firearms. Therefore, the claim that there are over 300 million firearms in the country is an overestimation.

Answer: 0"
760,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government has allocated a total of $1.9 trillion for the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which includes the stimulus plan. As of the latest reports, the majority of the funds have been spent or allocated. The remaining funds are not necessarily unspent but are being held for future use or are in the process of being allocated. The claim that there is still about $400 billion or $500 billion unspent is an oversimplification and not accurate.

765,"Explanation: The claim is based on a comparison of the wealth of the Walton family, which is estimated to be around $200 billion, with the wealth of the bottom 40 percent of American people. According to a 2021 report by the Federal Reserve, the median net worth of American households is around $100,000. The bottom 40 percent of Americans have a combined wealth of around $1.5 trillion.

Answer: 1"
768,"Explanation: The claim that a 9-9-9 tax reform plan is not regressive is based on the specifics of the plan. A regressive tax system is one where the tax burden is higher for lower-income individuals relative to their income. The 9-9-9 tax reform plan, proposed by some politicians, suggests a flat tax rate of 9% for income, 9% for sales, and 9% for capital gains. While this plan simplifies the tax code, it is generally considered regressive because it does not account for the ability to pay and can disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who spend a larger portion of their income on consumption.

Answer: 0"

770,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a maximum age limit of 112 years for active Social Security numbers. However, the SSA does not issue Social Security numbers to individuals who are 112 years old or older. The SSA only issues Social Security numbers to individuals who are alive and have not yet reached the maximum age limit. Therefore, it is not possible for there to be 6.5 million people with active Social Security numbers who are 112 years old or older.

For example, in a 2015 speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, he said, ""We are the first nation to make the words 'liberty' and 'justice' more than just words."" He also used the phrase in a 2016 speech at the Pentagon.

776,"Explanation: The claim is false. The amendment in question, known as the ""Use of Force"" amendment, does indeed change existing rules of engagement for American service members. It specifies that military members may use deadly force in certain situations, such as when they reasonably believe that doing so is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or others. This is a significant change from the previous rules, which were more restrictive. Therefore, the claim that the amendment does nothing to change existing rules of engagement is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
777,"Explanation: The claim ""Sometimes I was the only no vote on the entire board"" is subjective and cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence.

Without concrete information or proof, it is impossible to definitively judge the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
778,"Explanation: The claim that we can fix our roads without raising taxes is generally false. Road maintenance and repair require significant funding, which often comes from taxes. While there may be some potential for cost savings through efficiency improvements, innovative funding mechanisms, or public-private partnerships, the primary source of funding for road infrastructure is typically tax revenue. Therefore, the claim that we can fix our roads without raising taxes is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
779,"Explanation: The claim that Obama couldn't have afforded his home without Rezko's help is false. Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama purchased their home in Chicago in 2005, before he became a U.S. Senator. The home was purchased for $1.65 million, and they paid for it with their own funds. The claim that Rezko, a businessman and political donor, helped Obama afford the home is a misinterpretation of the facts. Rezko was involved in a political scandal in Illinois, but there is no evidence to suggest that he provided financial assistance to the Obamas for their home purchase.

Answer: 0"
780,"Explanation: The claim suggests that former President Barack Obama did not condemn left-wing attacks on General David Petraeus, despite casting other ""important votes"" earlier and later in the day.

Answer: 0/1"
781,"Explanation: The claim that the Clintons charge the Secret Service $10,000 monthly rent for the use of a Secret Service residence is false. The Secret Service does not charge the Clintons for the use of their residence. The Secret Service provides security for the Clintons, and the cost of their residence is covered by the federal government. The claim about the rent being equal to their mortgage payment is also false, as the Clintons do not pay a mortgage for the Secret Service residence.

Answer: 0"
782,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), also known as the ""death panel"" by critics, was created under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to recommend changes to Medicare payments to reduce the program's costs. However, the IPAB does not have the authority to interfere with the treatment decisions between patients and their doctors. The IPAB's role is limited to making recommendations to Congress about Medicare payments, not to dictate medical treatment. The term ""death panel"" was a misnomer used by critics to suggest that the IPAB would make decisions about end-of-life care, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
783,"Explanation: The claim that David Cicilline is the 5th most liberal person in the House of Representatives is not verifiable with the information provided.

784,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world is false. As of 2021, the U.S. has a federal corporate tax rate of 21%, which is lower than many other countries. For example, the corporate tax rate in France is 25%, in Germany it is 25%, and in Japan it is 30.62%. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world at 35% is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
785,"Explanation: The claim states that the United States doubled its commitment to fighting global AIDS in the first 17 months of the current president's term. The original commitment was $500 million per year. To double this commitment, the new commitment would need to be $1 billion per year. However, the claim does not specify the new commitment amount or provide any evidence to support the doubling of the commitment. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
786,"Explanation: The claim is referring to the ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows individuals to use deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm. The claim suggests that this law has led to ""horrific events"" and that lives have been put into these situations. While it is true that the law has been criticized for contributing to an increase in gun violence and controversial shootings, the claim itself is vague and does not provide specific examples or evidence to support the assertion that the law has directly caused ""horrific events"" or put lives into these situations. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and lacks specific evidence to support its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
787,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of anti-women's choice bills introduced in the first half of the current session to the last three General Assemblies.

Answer: 0"
792,"Explanation: The claim about the unemployment rate among blacks in Texas being 9.5% and wages falling for black workers since 2000 is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for blacks in Texas in 2021 was around 8.5%, which is indeed higher than the rate for whites (around 4.5%). However, the claim that the unemployment rate is ""far more than double white unemployment"" is misleading because it suggests a much higher disparity than the actual figures. Additionally, the claim about wages falling for black workers since 2000 is not supported by data. In fact, wages for black workers have generally increased over time, although the rate of increase has been slower compared to other groups.

Answer: 0"
794,"Explanation: The claim is true. In Florida, a proposed revenue smart cap would indeed require a 60 percent vote by citizens to impose a new tax, fee, license, fine, charge, or assessment. This is part of the state's constitutional amendment process, which aims to give citizens more control over tax increases.

Answer: 1"
795,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fourteen million Americans mortgages are greater than the value of their homes"" is false. This statement is misleading because it implies that a significant number of Americans are underwater on their mortgages, which is not accurate. According to various sources, the number of Americans with mortgages greater than the value of their homes is much lower. For instance, as of 2021, the number of underwater mortgages in the U.S. was around 1.5 million, which is significantly less than the 14 million stated in the claim.

Answer: 0"
797,"Explanation: The claim that 20 million illegals voting would lead to the repeal of the Second Amendment is a false and misleading statement. The Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms, is a part of the U.S. Constitution and cannot be repealed by a simple majority vote. Additionally, the claim that 20 million illegals would vote is not supported by any credible evidence or data. The actual number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is estimated to be around 10.5 million, and even if they were all to vote, it would not be enough to repeal the Second Amendment.

Answer: 0"
798,"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood has illegally sold baby parts is a misrepresentation of a 2015 controversy. The claim originated from a series of videos released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress, which alleged that Planned Parenthood was selling fetal tissue for profit. However, multiple investigations, including those by the FBI and the Department of Justice, found no evidence of illegal activity. The videos were later found to have been heavily edited and misleading. Therefore, the claim is false.

799,"Explanation: While toothaches can be extremely painful and uncomfortable, they are not typically life-threatening. Toothaches are usually caused by dental issues such as cavities, infections, or impacted wisdom teeth. While severe infections can lead to complications like sepsis, which can be life-threatening, this is not a common outcome of a typical toothache. Therefore, the claim that ""anyone can die of a toothache"" is an exaggeration and is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
800,"Explanation: The claim that Jim Frishe wanted to tax us for doing our taxes through an accountant is false. Jim Frishe is a fictional character from the TV show ""The Office.""

802,"Explanation: The claim is false. Jason Carter is a former governor of Georgia, and Nathan Deal was the governor of Georgia from 2011 to 2019. Jason Carter served as governor from 2019 to 2023. Therefore, it is not possible for Jason Carter to have backed Nathan Deal's budgets, as they were not in office at the same time. Additionally, the claim that Jason Carter accuses the governor of underfunding education is not supported by any known statements or actions from Jason Carter.

Answer: 0"
803,"Explanation: The claim is true. Oil drilling off the coast of Florida has been a topic of debate and controversy for many years. The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has been involved in leasing areas for oil and gas exploration and development in the Gulf of Mexico, which includes waters off the coast of Florida.

808,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has indeed led to a reduction in the number of insurance options in some states. This is primarily due to the consolidation of insurance markets, as some insurers have exited the market or reduced their offerings. However, the claim that it is ""four or five states"" is not accurate. The number of states affected varies, and it's not limited to just four or five. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
809,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted women the right to vote, was ratified in 1920, not 1915. Additionally, the amendment was passed by the U.S. Congress and ratified by the states, not by a referendum in New Jersey.

810,"Explanation: Carlos Curbelo, a former U.S. Representative from Florida, has been a vocal critic of Medicare for All proposals and has advocated for a more gradual approach to healthcare reform. However, he has not publicly supported ending the Medicare guarantee. In fact, he has expressed support for maintaining and improving Medicare. Therefore, the claim that he supported ending the Medicare guarantee is false.

Answer: 0"
811,"Explanation: The claim is false. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a massive spending bill, was indeed rushed through Congress in a short period, but it was not signed by President Obama until February 17, 2009, after it had been on his desk for three days. However, the claim that he was away on vacation during this time is incorrect. President Obama was in Washington, D.C., and did not leave the country until February 20, 2009.

Answer: 0"
812,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama directed ""Project Vote"" in 1992 is false. Barack Obama was not involved in ""Project Vote"" or ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) in 1992. He was a community organizer in Chicago at that time and did not become involved in politics until later. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his early career.

Answer: 0"
813,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fleeing Syria, a million children are now refugees"" is an exaggeration. While it is true that there are many children who have fled Syria due to the ongoing conflict, the number of children refugees is not exactly one million. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of 2021, there are approximately 2.5 million Syrian refugee children. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
814,"Explanation: The claim is true. In the United States, federal law requires that military personnel be paid on time, regardless of government shutdowns. However, during a shutdown, the military is funded by the previous year's appropriations, and personnel are paid retroactively once the shutdown ends and appropriations are available. This means that while military personnel continue to serve and accrue pay, they will not actually receive their pay until the shutdown is over and the government has appropriated funds.

Answer: 1"
815,"Explanation: The claim that Rand Paul's speech on Gattaca was totally ripped off of Wikipedia is false. While it is possible that some elements of the speech may have been inspired by information found on Wikipedia, it is not accurate to say that the entire speech was copied from Wikipedia. Speeches often draw from a variety of sources, including personal knowledge, research, and other public sources, and are typically not verbatim copies of any single source.

Answer: 0"
816,"Explanation: The claim is false. Polls conducted during the 2016 U.S. presidential election did include third-party candidates like Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. For example, the RealClearPolitics average of polls in October 2016 showed Trump at 44.1%, Clinton at 45.1%, and Johnson at 11.5%. The claim that no polls included third-party candidates is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
817,"Explanation: The claim that 98 percent of American families make under $250,000 a year is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, the median household income in the United States was $68,703. While it's true that a large percentage of families earn less than $250,000, the claim that 98 percent do so is an exaggeration. The actual percentage of families earning less than $250,000 is closer to 90 percent.

Answer: 0"
818,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Barbara Boxer passed only three bills in 18 years into law is false. According to the Library of Congress, Sen. Boxer has sponsored 1,000 bills and resolutions, and has had 100 bills signed into law during her time in the Senate. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of her legislative record.

Answer: 0"
819,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of Americans working in 2016 (when Obama was president) was 155.0 million, and in 2020, it was 153.7 million. This means there were 1.3 million fewer Americans working in 2020 compared to 2016, not 8.3 million.

Answer: 0"
820,"Explanation: The claim is generally true. Hedge fund managers and private equity professionals often have access to various tax strategies and structures that can result in lower effective tax rates compared to those of truck drivers, teachers, and nurses. These strategies can include the use of pass-through entities, complex tax planning, and the ability to defer or reduce taxes through various deductions and credits. However, it's important to note that the specific tax rates can vary based on individual circumstances and the tax laws in different jurisdictions.

Answer: 1"
821,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the roads or the location. It does not specify what ""terrible"" means in this context (e.g., heavy traffic, accidents, road closures, etc.). Without additional context or specific details, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
822,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there have been several Latinos who have served on the Austin City Council. The exact number can vary, but it is accurate to say that at least four Latinos have served on the council. The claim mentions ""maybe five,"" which is a bit ambiguous but generally aligns with the historical data.

Answer: 1"
823,"Explanation: The claim is false. There are many people and organizations in various fields who are against amnesty for illegal immigrants. For example, the Center for Immigration Studies, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, and many conservative politicians and advocacy groups have publicly opposed amnesty. Additionally, there are numerous legal scholars and immigration experts who have argued against amnesty. Therefore, the claim that the speaker is the only person in this field who is against amnesty is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
827,"Explanation: The claim that the entire state of Florida led the nation last year with the most prison inmates committing tax fraud is false. While Florida does have a high number of prison inmates, it is not accurate to say that it led the nation in tax fraud specifically. The claim is misleading and lacks specific data to support it.

Answer: 0"
828,"Explanation: The claim suggests that most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums and it would still be half the national average. This claim is false because it implies a specific comparison between state employees' premiums and the national average, which is not provided in the claim. Without specific data or context, it is impossible to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
830,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2019, the median household income in Texas was $64,000. While Texas has a high concentration of wealthy individuals, particularly in the oil and gas industry, the majority of Texans do not fall into the millionaire category. The claim that ""most Texans aren't millionaires"" is supported by statistical data.

Answer: 1"
831,"Explanation: The claim is false. The weight of a single $1 bill is approximately 1 gram. The national debt of $14.1 trillion would require 14,100,000,000,000 bills. The weight of these bills would be 14,100,000,000,000 grams, or 14,100,000,000 kilograms. An aircraft carrier typically weighs around 100,000 tons (90,718,474 kilograms). Therefore, the weight of the bills would be approximately 155 aircraft carriers, not 136.

Answer: 0"
832,"Explanation: The claim that the Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country under Scott Walker is not accurate. According to a 2018 report by the Wisconsin Policy Forum, Wisconsin's middle class has been shrinking, but it is not the fastest rate among all states. The report also noted that Wisconsin's middle class has been shrinking at a similar rate to other states in the Midwest. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
833,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the per-student spending in Virginia in 2008 with the current spending. According to the Virginia Department of Education, the state's per-student spending in 2008 was approximately $10,000. In recent years, the per-student spending has been around $12,000 to $13,000. Therefore, the claim that Virginia spends less per student today than in 2008 is false.

Answer: 0"
834,"Explanation: The claim that the economic impact of Atlanta's 2000 Super Bowl was $292 million is false. The actual economic impact of the Super Bowl in Atlanta in 2000 was estimated to be around $300 million, not $292 million. This information is based on reports from the time and subsequent economic impact studies.

Answer: 0"
835,"Explanation: To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of people who hunt and fish in Texas with the total attendance of the Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets games. According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold in Texas annually is around 1.5 million. On the other hand, the combined attendance of the four sports teams (Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets) is significantly lower. For example, in the 2021-2022 season, the combined attendance of these teams was approximately 3.5 million. Therefore, the claim that more people hunt and fish in Texas in a given year than attend the games of the four teams combined is false.

Answer: 0"
836,"Explanation: The claim states that there has been only one tax increase since the speaker has been in office, specifically a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area. This claim is true because it accurately reflects the tax increase that occurred during their tenure.

Answer: 1"
837,"Explanation: The claim that the profit from automated traffic enforcement cameras is going to private corporations rather than to the city or state is generally false. The revenue generated from these cameras typically goes to the city or state, which uses it for various purposes such as improving infrastructure, maintaining public services, or reducing traffic congestion. Private corporations may be involved in the installation, maintenance, or operation of these cameras, but the revenue itself is usually managed by the public entity.

Answer: 0"
838,"Explanation: The claim ""We broke. We don't have any more money"" is a subjective statement and does not provide specific details or evidence to support its truthfulness.

He has been criticized for questioning the official account of the event, but he did not deny the deaths of people involved.

Answer: 0"
840,"Explanation: The claim is made by former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. However, there is no credible evidence or record of 10 percent of the state legislature being put in jail during his tenure. This claim is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of his accomplishments.

Answer: 0"
841,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker has given back over $370,000 of his salary to the county since being elected in 2002 is false. Scott Walker served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, not since 2002. Additionally, there is no record of him giving back such a significant amount of his salary to the county.

Answer: 0"
842,"Explanation: The claim is false. The religious liberty bill proposed in the Georgia House of Representatives, known as HB 105, does not explicitly exclude corporations from claiming a religious exemption. However, the bill does not provide a blanket exemption for corporations either. It allows individuals and businesses to claim a religious exemption based on their sincerely held beliefs, but it does not specify that corporations can automatically claim this exemption. Therefore, while corporations could potentially claim a religious exemption, it is not explicitly stated in the bill that they can do so.

Answer: 0"
843,"Explanation: David Dewhurst, a former Lieutenant Governor of Texas, has been criticized for his role in budget cuts during his tenure. In 2011, he was involved in a budget reduction plan that led to cuts in various state programs. Therefore, the claim that he has never once cut one penny from the state budget is false.

The claim of 150 different pension plans is an exaggeration and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
845,"Explanation: The claim that a defense bill includes language that would require military hospitals to provide abortions on demand is false. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2023, which is a defense bill, does not include such language.

Answer: 0"
846,"Explanation: The claim is true. Wisconsin does not have a state law specifically prohibiting gender discrimination in pay, unlike many other states. This is due to the repeal of a 2009 law by Governor Scott Walker. Wisconsin is one of five states without such a law.

Answer: 1"
847,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the latest data from the New Jersey Department of Corrections, as of 2021, the prison population in New Jersey is approximately 40% African-American, not 61%. The state's overall African-American population is indeed around 13%, but the prison population is disproportionately higher due to various factors such as higher rates of arrest and conviction among African-Americans.

Answer: 0"
848,"Explanation: The claim is not supported by reliable statistical evidence. While it is true that some students may experience a decrease in their SAT scores when retaking the test, the claim that one third of test-takers will get a lower score is an overgeneralization and not based on established data. The College Board, which administers the SAT, does not provide specific statistics on the percentage of students who score lower on a retake. Therefore, the claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
849,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Obama has declared and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions is false. While Sen. Barack Obama did express a willingness to engage in diplomatic talks with Iran during his presidency, he did not do so without preconditions. In fact, he maintained that such talks would require Iran to meet certain conditions, such as addressing its nuclear program and regional behavior. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
850,"Explanation: The claim ""I'm proud to have had a 100 percent pro-life voting record"" is a statement that can be true or false depending on the context and the specific political positions of the individual making the claim. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting record of the individual in question. Without specific information about the individual's voting history, it is impossible to definitively determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0/1"
851,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in their monthly report on U.S. crude oil production and imports. The EIA reported that in March 2021, the U.S. produced more oil than it imported for the first time since 2002. This is a significant milestone, as it indicates a shift in the U.S.'s dependence on oil imports and a rise in domestic production.

Answer: 1"
852,"Explanation: The claim that every eligible Mexican citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram is false.

Answer: 0"
854,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that reducing obesity rates to the levels of the 1980s would significantly decrease healthcare costs, specifically for Medicare. However, this claim oversimplifies the issue. Obesity rates have been increasing due to a combination of factors, including changes in diet, physical activity, and environmental factors. Simply reducing obesity rates to 1980s levels would not necessarily lead to a trillion-dollar savings in Medicare costs. Additionally, the claim does not account for the potential costs of implementing and maintaining such a reduction in obesity rates, nor does it consider the potential economic benefits of a healthier population.

Answer: 0"
855,"Explanation: Austin, Texas, does not have nonstop flights to Europe. The city is served by Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS), which offers flights to several international destinations, but none of these are nonstop flights to Europe. The claim is true.

Answer: 1"
856,"Explanation: The claim states that a 12-year council member has never chaired, vice-chaired, or led a single council committee meeting. This claim is false because it is not possible for a council member to have been in office for 12 years without having chaired, vice-chaired, or led at least one committee meeting. Council members typically have roles and responsibilities that include participating in and leading committee meetings.

Answer: 0"
857,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Supreme Court's website, six justices have been confirmed during election years since 1900. These justices include Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in 1988, the final year of the Reagan Administration.

Answer: 1"
858,"Explanation: The claim that Mexico can afford to build a wall because of its trade deficit with the United States is misleading. While it is true that Mexico has a trade deficit with the United States, this does not directly translate to Mexico having the financial resources to build a wall. The trade deficit refers to the difference between the value of imports and exports, which is influenced by various factors including trade policies, economic conditions, and consumer preferences. The cost of building a wall would be a significant investment that would need to be funded through government spending, which is not directly related to the trade deficit.

Answer: 0"
859,"Explanation: The claim that the Chicago White Sox can still get into the playoffs mathematically depends on several factors, including their remaining schedule, the performance of other teams, and the current standings. As of my last update, I don't have real-time data, but typically, teams can still mathematically make the playoffs if they have a reasonable number of games left and are within a certain number of games behind the teams in the playoff spots. However, without specific data on the current standings and remaining games, it's challenging to definitively say whether they can still make the playoffs.

Answer: 0/1"
860,"Explanation: The claim that a candidate has released their past tax returns is a common political statement. However, without specific details or evidence, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of this claim. Typically, candidates release their tax returns to build trust with voters and demonstrate transparency. If the candidate has indeed released their tax returns, this claim would be true. If not, it would be false.

Answer: 1 (assuming the candidate has released their tax returns)"
861,"Explanation: The claim that the media widely overlooked comments made by former President Bill Clinton about Hillary Clinton's concussion is false. The incident in question occurred in 2016 when Hillary Clinton collapsed at a 9/11 memorial service. The media extensively covered the incident, and Bill Clinton himself made comments about it. He stated that Hillary Clinton had a concussion and that it took her six months to recover. This information was widely reported in the media at the time. Therefore, the claim that the media overlooked this information is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
862,"Explanation: The claim that she voted against the Medicare Part D prescription drug program because it was unfunded is false. Medicare Part D was actually funded through a combination of premiums paid by beneficiaries, general revenue, and other sources. The program was not unfunded.

Answer: 0"
863,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual's position on guns and their actions as a governor, as well as receiving an endorsement from the National Rifle Association (NRA). This claim is subjective and cannot be objectively verified without additional context or evidence. It is a personal statement and does not provide verifiable information.

Answer: 0"
864,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the average cost per vote for a candidate to the cost per vote for another candidate. However, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the figures mentioned (two bucks a pop for the votes they got and 42 bucks for incumbent Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele). Without concrete evidence or data to back up these figures, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"

866,"Explanation: The claim is about the political stance of Mitt Romney regarding a three-state solution in Iraq. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified statement from Mitt Romney specifically stating his position on a three-state solution in Iraq. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on available information.

Answer: 0"
867,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, Missouri does not have a perfect AAA credit rating. The state's credit rating is typically lower, reflecting its fiscal health and debt levels. Texas, on the other hand, has a higher credit rating, but it is not perfect AAA either. Therefore, the claim that Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating is false.

Answer: 0"
868,"Explanation: The 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act was a proposal by President Obama to invest in infrastructure and job creation. The claim that it would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year is not accurate. The act was designed to create jobs and improve infrastructure, but the cost per family was not $1,000 a year. The claim also suggests that the act would have made no significant impact, which is a subjective statement and not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
869,"Explanation: The claim about the number of car crashes on the Columbia River Bridge is not accurate. According to the Washington State Department of Transportation, the number of crashes on the bridge is significantly lower. For instance, in 2020, there were approximately 1,000 crashes on the bridge, not 400. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not based on reliable data.

Answer: 0"
870,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Boston is 60 minutes away from Providence and offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent, while construction costs are similar. This claim is misleading because the distance between Boston and Providence is approximately 45 minutes by car, not 60. Additionally, the claim that Boston offers subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent is not accurate. Boston does not have a specific subsidy program for developers that allows them to charge higher rent. The claim about the skyline being dominated by cranes is true, as Boston has been experiencing significant construction activity in recent years.

Answer: 0"
871,"Explanation: The claim that notices were sent to Jews in Ukraine indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews is false. There is no credible evidence or official reports supporting this claim. The Ukrainian government has not implemented such a policy, and it would be against international human rights laws and Ukrainian laws protecting religious freedom.

Answer: 0"
872,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that the judicial system is the most underfunded in the state and that judges receive some of the richest pensions among public employees is not supported by reliable sources. The funding and pension information for the judicial system would typically be available through official government reports or budget documents, which would provide specific figures and comparisons. Without such evidence, the claim cannot be verified as true.

Answer: 0"
873,"Explanation: George Washington, the first President of the United States, was known for his religious beliefs and often referenced God in his speeches and writings. He frequently invoked divine guidance and providence in his public addresses. Therefore, it is accurate to say that one would likely hear him reference God, the Almighty, in his speeches.

Answer: 1"
874,"Explanation: The claim suggests that if Oregon's legislature authorizes $450 million for the Columbia River Crossing (CRC) project, it will result in Oregon bearing a greater cost responsibility than initially planned. However, the claim does not provide specific details or evidence to support this assertion. Without concrete information on the total cost of the project, the additional costs Oregon might be responsible for, or the funding sources and allocations, it is not possible to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
877,"Explanation: The claim that photos prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership is not accurate. Photos alone cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of ridership. To accurately assess ridership, one would need to consider data from the transit authority, such as passenger counts, ridership trends, and other relevant statistics. Photos can provide visual evidence but do not provide quantitative data.

Answer: 0"
878,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 data, Rhode Island does indeed have the highest gambling revenue per capita among all states in the U.S. This is primarily due to the state's legalized gambling industry, which includes casinos, lottery, and other forms of gambling. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
879,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that a pack-a-day smoker spends $1,650 a year on cigarettes. However, the actual cost of cigarettes can vary greatly depending on the location, brand, and tax rates. Therefore, the claim is not universally applicable and cannot be considered true without specific data on the cost of cigarettes in the context of the tax increase.

Answer: 0"
880,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher is the only working farmer currently serving in the House is false. While Rep. Fincher is a farmer, there are other members of Congress who also work in agriculture or have farming backgrounds. For example, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) is a farmer and has served in the House. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
881,"Explanation: The claim about Milwaukee police and firefighters receiving 4 percent raises annually while others receive zero or one percent raises is not accurate. Public sector employees, including police and firefighters, often have collective bargaining agreements that determine their salary increases. These agreements are typically negotiated between the unions representing the employees and the city or county governments. While it is possible for certain groups to receive higher raises, it is not accurate to say that this is a routine occurrence for all police and firefighters. The claim seems to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the actual salary negotiation process.

Answer: 0"
882,"Explanation: The claim that Disney was looking to build Disney World in Miami and was told to ""take a hike"" is false. Disney World was actually built in Orlando, Florida, not Miami. The misconception might arise from the fact that Disney initially considered building in Miami before deciding on Orlando.

Answer: 0"
883,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times is false. While John McCain did support cap and trade legislation, he did not introduce it three times. He was a co-sponsor of the Climate Security Act of 2007, which was introduced by Senator Joseph Lieberman, but he did not introduce it himself. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

Answer: 0"

There is no evidence or credible source to support the claim that Susan Happ, a district attorney, took $180,000 in a shady land deal from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution. This claim appears to be a fabrication or misinformation.

Answer: 0"
886,"Explanation: The claim that 300,000 voters were turned away by Wisconsin's strict voter ID law in the 2016 presidential election is false. According to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, only about 17,000 voters were unable to cast a ballot due to the voter ID law in the 2016 election. The claim significantly overstates the number of voters affected.

Answer: 0"
887,"Explanation: The claim states that Dan Patrick was the only state senator who voted against the Veteran Entrepreneurship Program. However, without specific information about the voting record of all state senators on this particular bill, it is impossible to verify if Dan Patrick was indeed the only one to vote against it. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
888,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely known or proposed immigration legislation that provides new immigrants with taxpayer-funded cellular phones. Immigration policies typically focus on issues such as visa requirements, border control, and integration programs, but not on providing specific items like cellular phones. Therefore, this claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
889,"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigrants mow the grass around the Texas Capitol is true.

890,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific policy, ""Blueprint for Prosperity,"" and its impact on tax relief.

Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
891,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt was reduced every year under Obama is false. While the national debt did decrease in 2013, 2014, and 2015, it increased in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Therefore, the statement that the national debt was reduced every year for the last five years is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
892,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement ""Since 1961 our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs"" is not accurate. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the total number of private-sector jobs in the U.S. has fluctuated over time, but it has not consistently been 66 million since 1961. Additionally, the claim that Republicans have created 24 million jobs and Democrats have created 42 million jobs is not supported by any reliable data source. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of job creation statistics.

Answer: 0"
893,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. tax code does not provide a tax deduction for companies that close down American factories and offices and move those jobs overseas. In fact, the U.S. tax code has provisions that can discourage companies from moving jobs overseas, such as the Foreign Tax Credit and the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, which are designed to prevent U.S. companies from avoiding U.S. taxes by moving operations abroad.

Answer: 0"
894,"Explanation: The claim that ""We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day"" is false. The baby boomer generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is a large cohort, but the number of baby boomers retiring each day is not 10,000. The actual number of baby boomers retiring each day is much lower, typically around 10,000 per day, but this is a general estimate and not an exact figure. The claim exaggerates the number significantly.

Answer: 0"

As of the latest data available, the unemployment rate for young people in the U.S. is around 10.3%, which is still significantly higher than the claimed 2.6%.

Answer: 0"

899,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of crime statistics. The U.K. figure of over 2,000 crimes per 100,000 population is a general crime rate, while the U.S. figure of 466 violent crimes per 100,000 is a specific type of crime rate. These two figures are not directly comparable because they measure different things. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
900,"Explanation: According to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey, only 16% of Americans say they often get news from Facebook. This is significantly lower than the percentage of Americans who get news from other sources such as TV (55%), radio (24%), or news websites (29%).

Answer: 0"
902,"Explanation: The claim suggests that illegal immigration would not be a significant issue if it weren't for the person making the claim. This statement is false because illegal immigration is a complex issue influenced by numerous factors, including economic conditions, political instability, and international policies.

Answer: 0"
903,"Explanation: The claim about a $300 million stimulus allocation to Wisconsin leading to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in every corner of the state is not verifiable with the information provided.

Without specific data or sources to back up the claim, it is not possible to confirm its accuracy.

Nancy Pelosi has been the Speaker of the House of Representatives since 2007, and during her tenure, she has had a consistent voting record.

Answer: 0"
905,"Explanation: The claim that former President Barack Obama ""supports hate-crimes expansion ... potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality"" is false. During his presidency, Obama did not support expanding hate-crime laws to include sexual orientation. In fact, he signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law in 2009, which expanded federal hate-crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. However, this law did not target churches or religious institutions for preaching about homosexuality. The claim is a misinterpretation of the law and its intent.

Answer: 0"
906,"Explanation: The claim that Democrats' budget resolution would raise America's tax bill by ""$500-billion"" is false. The budget resolution proposed by Democrats does not include a $500 billion tax increase.

Answer: 0"
907,"Explanation: The claim is false. Barack Obama did not propose to ""restore"" the estate tax that George W. Bush ""repealed.""

This data suggests that there are indeed more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than in higher education.

Answer: 1"
909,"Explanation: The claim that the Greenlight Pinellas transportation plan involves a 300% tax increase is false. The Greenlight Pinellas plan, which is a proposed sales tax increase to fund transportation projects in Pinellas County, Florida, has been widely reported to involve a 1% sales tax increase, not a 300% increase. The 1% increase would be added to the existing 7% sales tax rate in Pinellas County.

Answer: 0"
910,"Explanation: The claim that some men serving in the Afghan armed forces have never driven a vehicle before is plausible. In many countries, including Afghanistan, not all individuals have access to or experience with driving vehicles. This could be due to various reasons such as lack of access to vehicles, lack of driving education, or cultural factors. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that some individuals in the Afghan armed forces may not have driven a vehicle before.

Answer: 1"
911,"Explanation: The claim that the economy shrank during the last three months of 2012 is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 0.1%, indicating a slight growth in the economy. Therefore, the claim that the economy shrank is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
912,"Explanation: Mercury is indeed present in compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), and if a CFL bulb is broken, it can release mercury vapor. However, the amount of mercury released is very small and not enough to pose a significant health risk. The primary concern with broken CFLs is the glass shards and the potential for electrical shock. The claim that you should throw away your shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them is an exaggeration. It is recommended to clean up the broken bulb carefully, using a damp cloth to avoid inhaling mercury vapor, and to dispose of the bulb according to local regulations.

Answer: 0"
913,"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator from Arizona, was known for his bipartisan approach to politics and had a mixed record on environmental issues.

Answer: 1"
917,"Explanation: The claim that closing the tobacco loophole would save Missouri taxpayers $50,000,000 is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. The term ""tobacco loophole"" is not a widely recognized term in the context of Missouri's tax policy, and there is no specific legislation or policy that is referred to as such. Therefore, it is not possible to verify the claim that closing this hypothetical loophole would save $50,000,000 for Missouri taxpayers.

Answer: 0"
918,"Explanation: The claim that health care premiums have increased by 90 percent in New Hampshire is likely false. While health care costs have been rising in the United States, a 90 percent increase is an unusually high figure and is not supported by reliable sources. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average annual increase in premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance plans in New Hampshire has been around 4-5 percent per year in recent years.

Answer: 0"
919,"Explanation: The claim is true. The House of Representatives has 435 members, and the speaker's statement about freshmen lawmakers and their experience aligns with the typical distribution of experience in the House. Freshmen lawmakers are those who have been elected for the first time, and they indeed account for one-third of the House. Additionally, two-thirds of the chamber having two years or less experience is a common observation in the House, as many members are elected for the first time or have limited prior experience.

Answer: 1"
920,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate was the end of his chances to win is not accurate. While the selection of Ryan did have some political implications, it did not definitively end Romney's chances of winning the election. The 2012 presidential election was highly competitive and influenced by various factors, including the economy, the candidates' performances in debates, and campaign strategies. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
922,"Explanation: The claim is false. The line-item veto authority allows a president to veto specific spending items in a bill, but it does not allow them to reduce the overall budget size. The claim that the budget is smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by the predecessor is not accurate, as the overall budget size is determined by the total spending approved by Congress, not by the line-item veto authority.

Answer: 0"
923,"Explanation: The claim that someone paid one dollar for a sweater at Kohls is highly unlikely. Kohls is a retail store that sells a variety of products, including clothing, but their prices are typically higher than one dollar. It's possible that the sweater was on sale or there was a mistake in the price, but it's not a common occurrence for a sweater to be priced at one dollar.

Answer: 0"
924,"Explanation: The claim is false. The combined inflation and unemployment rates in October 2011 were not the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter. In October 2011, the unemployment rate was 9.1% and the inflation rate was around 3.5%. During Ronald Reagan's presidency, the unemployment rate peaked at 10.8% in November 1982, and the inflation rate peaked at 13.5% in October 1980. Therefore, the claim that the combined rates in October 2011 were the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
925,"Explanation: The claim that black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in the states with the strictest voter ID laws, is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, black voter turnout in 2012 was 66.2%, while white voter turnout was 64.1%. Additionally, studies have shown that strict voter ID laws can disproportionately affect minority voters, potentially reducing their turnout. Therefore, the claim that black voter turnout exceeded white voter turnout in states with strict voter ID laws is incorrect.

Answer: 0"

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, was passed in 2010. Sen. Brown voted in favor of the bill, but the deciding vote was cast by Sen. Ted Kennedy, who was the last Democrat to vote in favor of the bill, securing its passage.

Answer: 0"
931,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rudy Giuliani did not omit the September 11, 2001, strikes as a successful terrorist attack. In fact, Giuliani has repeatedly spoken about the 9/11 attacks and their impact on his life and career. He has also been critical of President Obama's handling of the Benghazi incident, which he has compared to the 9/11 attacks. Therefore, the claim that Giuliani omitted the 9/11 attacks as a successful terrorist attack is inaccurate.

The decision to privatize or not privatize the Ohio Turnpike would depend on various factors such as financial needs, public opinion, and potential benefits or drawbacks of privatization. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer of 0 or 1 based on the information given.

Answer: N/A"
935,"Explanation: The claim that it costs more to shut the government down than to keep it open is generally true. Government shutdowns can lead to significant economic costs, including lost productivity, delayed payments, and increased uncertainty. For example, during the 2018-2019 shutdown, the U.S. government estimated that the shutdown cost the economy $11 billion. In contrast, keeping the government open ensures that essential services continue to function, and the economy operates smoothly. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
936,"Explanation: The claim is false. Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor and current U.S. Representative, has not been reported to have ridden on a jet belonging to a serial polluter.

938,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney's health care plan provides a $50 co-pay for abortions is false. Romney's health care plan, as proposed during his 2012 presidential campaign, did not include provisions for abortion coverage.

Therefore, the claim that there is a $50 co-pay for abortions under Romney's health care plan is inaccurate.

940,"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is out of money and is borrowing from the general treasury is not accurate. Social Security is a self-funded program that collects payroll taxes and uses them to pay benefits. It does not borrow from the general treasury.

Answer: 0"
941,"Explanation: The claim that under his tax plan, seniors making less than $50,000 per year won't pay any income taxes is a simplification. While it's true that some tax plans propose to reduce or eliminate taxes for low-income individuals, including seniors, the specifics of the plan would need to be examined to determine if it indeed applies to all seniors making less than $50,000 per year. The claim as stated is an oversimplification and may not accurately reflect the full scope of the tax plan.

Answer: 0"
942,"Explanation: The claim that this kind of snowstorm happens every 10 or 15 years is not accurate. Snowstorms, like any weather event, are influenced by a variety of factors including atmospheric conditions, temperature, and pressure systems.

The Koch Brothers, through their various organizations, did spend a significant amount of money in the 2016 elections, but they did not exceed the spending of the Democratic or Republican parties. The Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee both raised and spent more money than the Koch Brothers in the 2016 election cycle.

Answer: 0"
944,"Explanation: The claim that the Bush tax cuts helped to create a substantial part of the deficit is true. The Bush tax cuts, implemented in 2001 and 2003, reduced tax rates for both individuals and businesses.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has reported that the tax cuts, along with other factors, significantly increased the federal deficit.

Answer: 1"

The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of the Girl Scouts' educational goals.

Answer: 0"
947,"Explanation: The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was indeed designed to ensure that wealthy individuals and corporations pay at least a minimum amount of tax, regardless of deductions and credits they might otherwise claim. However, the AMT was not originally intended to target middle-income individuals. It was primarily aimed at high-income individuals and corporations who might use tax loopholes to reduce their tax liability. Over time, due to changes in tax law and inflation, the AMT has affected more middle-income taxpayers than originally intended.

Answer: 0"
948,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2019.

Answer: 1"
950,"Explanation: The claim that many local governments in Wisconsin already require employees to pay 20 percent, 30 percent, or even 40 percent of their health insurance premiums is not accurate. While it is true that some employers may require employees to contribute a portion of their health insurance premiums, the percentages mentioned (20%, 30%, and 40%) are not typical or standard across Wisconsin. The actual contribution rates can vary widely, and there is no evidence to support that a significant number of local governments in Wisconsin are requiring such high percentages.

Answer: 0"
951,"Explanation: The claim that ""Today, the Social Security system is broke"" is not accurate.

According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas, there are approximately 200 inspectors for the entire state.

956,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama's policies led to a 29 percent increase in grocery prices is a misattribution. While it is true that grocery prices have increased, this increase is primarily due to factors such as supply chain disruptions, inflation, and increased demand, rather than specific policies of former President Obama. The claim also incorrectly attributes the 29 percent increase in grocery prices to a single event (Barack Obama's policies) rather than acknowledging the complex interplay of multiple factors.

Answer: 0"

Additionally, a 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that 61% of Americans support legal abortion in all or most cases. These polls suggest that public support for abortion has been relatively stable or slightly increasing, not decreasing.

Answer: 0"
961,"Explanation: The claim is true. The tradition of not filling Supreme Court vacancies during a presidential election year is indeed a longstanding practice among Senate Republicans. This tradition is often referred to as the ""Biden Rule,"" named after former Vice President Joe Biden, who as a senator in 1992 advocated for not confirming Supreme Court nominees during an election year. This practice is based on the belief that the decision should be made by the incoming president, rather than the outgoing one.

971,"Explanation: The claim that unemployment in Ohio is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and that it has always been that way is not accurate. Ohio is a right-to-work state, which means that workers cannot be required to join a union as a condition of employment. The unemployment rate in Ohio can vary over time and is influenced by numerous factors, including economic conditions, industry trends, and labor market dynamics. It is not accurate to attribute higher unemployment rates solely to unionization status. Additionally, the claim that this has always been the case is not supported by historical data, as unemployment rates fluctuate based on various economic factors.

981,"Explanation: The claim that Joe Kyrillos voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion, costing New Jersey taxpayers nearly $15 billion to repay, is false.
