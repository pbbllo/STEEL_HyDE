0,"Explanation: The claim states that a specific individual condemned violence at a campaign stop in Arizona in March. Without specific details about the individual and the context of the campaign stop, it is not possible to verify the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
1,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Ohio House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, has not voted to change the process for drawing legislative boundaries to create objective criteria and modify the Constitution. The redistricting process in Ohio is currently controlled by the Republican-led legislature, and there is no evidence to suggest that they have voted to change the process to make it more objective or to take politics out of it.

Answer: 0"
2,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is responsible for over $14 trillion in debt is false. Debt accumulation is a result of the actions of the entire government, including the executive branch and Congress, and is not attributable to a single individual. Sen. Brown has been a member of Congress since 1993 and has served in various capacities, but the debt level is a cumulative figure that reflects the policies and actions of multiple administrations and Congresses over many years.

Answer: 0"
3,"Explanation: The claim that consumers save an average of $500 per car sold through franchised dealer model compared to direct sales by manufacturers is not universally accurate. The savings can vary greatly depending on the specific manufacturer, the model of the car, the location, and the individual dealership's pricing strategies. Additionally, direct sales by manufacturers often come with additional perks like lower overhead costs, which can sometimes offset the savings. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
4,"Explanation: The claim that 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance both before and after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is misleading. While it is true that Wisconsin had a high rate of insurance coverage before Obamacare, the claim that the rate remained unchanged after the implementation is inaccurate. The Affordable Care Act expanded access to health insurance, particularly for low-income individuals and families, which led to an increase in the number of people with health insurance coverage. Therefore, the claim that Obamacare had no impact on insurance coverage rates is false.

Answer: 0"
5,"Explanation: The claim about the Atlanta Streetcar creating 1,399 jobs is based on a study conducted by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) in 2014. The study estimated that the streetcar would create 1,399 jobs during its construction and operation. This study was widely reported in local media and has been cited as a basis for the claim. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
6,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin is one of the bluest states and that under Scott Walker its unemployment rate is around 3.5% is partially true. Wisconsin is indeed considered a ""blue"" state, meaning it tends to vote Democratic. However, the unemployment rate under Scott Walker, who served as governor from 2011 to 2019, was not around 3.5%. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin during his tenure varied, but it was generally higher than 3.5%. For example, in 2015, the unemployment rate was around 5.5%, and in 2019, it was around 3.2%.

Answer: 0"
9,"Explanation: The claim ""I don't have lobbyists running my campaign"" is a statement made by a candidate or political figure. The truthfulness of this claim depends on the specific context and the definition of ""lobbyists."" In political campaigns, ""lobbyists"" can refer to individuals or groups who advocate for or against specific policies or candidates. If the candidate is referring to professional lobbyists who are actively working on their behalf, then the claim would be false if such individuals are indeed involved. However, if the candidate is referring to informal supporters or volunteers, the claim could be true. Without specific information about the context and the definition of ""lobbyists,"" it is not possible to definitively judge the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
10,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that alcohol is illegal for individuals under 21 in many jurisdictions, this does not mean that underage alcohol use has increased. The claim seems to imply a contradiction, suggesting that underage alcohol use has increased despite the legal prohibition. This is not supported by evidence and is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
11,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was designed to improve access to healthcare and reduce administrative burdens. It includes provisions to ensure that patients receive timely care, including access to necessary medical services like CAT scans. The claim that a bureaucrat would delay treatment under Obamacare is not supported by the actual provisions of the law, which aim to streamline and expedite healthcare services. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
12,"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true in many contexts, but not universally true.)"

14,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific event involving Bill Flores and a company that laid off over 3,000 workers and paid off executives with millions.

Answer: 0"
16,"Explanation: The claim that Tammy Baldwin supports a law in which the government will take over your decisions on medicine, doctors, and hospitals is false. Tammy Baldwin, a Democratic Senator from Wisconsin, has been a strong advocate for healthcare reform, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare for All proposals. However, these proposals do not involve the government taking over individual decisions about medicine, doctors, and hospitals. Instead, they aim to expand access to healthcare and reduce costs. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of her positions.

Answer: 0"
17,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) will cause Medicare to ""go away in less than 10 years"" is a misrepresentation of the facts. The Affordable Care Act was designed to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by reducing waste, fraud, and abuse, and by encouraging preventive care and wellness programs. The claim that Medicare will ""fall apart at the seams"" due to Obamacare is not supported by evidence or expert analysis. The Medicare Trustees' Report for 2021 projects that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted by 2026, but this is due to long-term trends in healthcare costs and demographics, not specifically due to the Affordable Care Act.

Answer: 0"
18,"Explanation: The claim is false. Sen. John McCain did not spend the July 4 weekend in Islamabad, Pakistan, selling F-16s and advanced weapons. McCain was a prominent figure in U.S. politics and was known for his involvement in foreign policy, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he was in Pakistan during that time or that he was involved in selling weapons to the Pakistani government. Additionally, the claim that Pakistan ""harbored Osama bin Laden"" is also false, as bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in 2011, and the U.S. military operation that led to his death was conducted in Abbottabad, Pakistan, not Islamabad.

Answer: 0"
19,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump ""doesn't make a thing in America"" is false. Donald Trump has been involved in various business ventures and has made significant contributions to the American economy. He has been a prominent figure in real estate, television, and politics.

Answer: 0"
21,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama's plan calls for ""mandates and fines for small businesses"" is false. During his presidency, Obama's administration implemented the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which included provisions for small businesses to provide health insurance to their employees. However, the ACA did not mandate that all small businesses provide health insurance, nor did it impose fines specifically for small businesses that did not comply with the law. The fines were primarily targeted at larger businesses that did not offer health insurance to their employees.

Answer: 0"
22,"Explanation: The claim states that the area near the proposed northern Wisconsin iron ore mine is 15 hours away from where the public hearing on mining was held. This claim is false because the distance between two locations is typically measured in miles or kilometers, not hours. The time it takes to travel between two locations depends on the mode of transportation and the speed at which it travels. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine the distance between two locations using hours as the unit of measurement.

Answer: 0"
23,"Explanation: The claim that ""Our credit rating went up since I've been in office"" is a subjective statement that depends on the specific context and the time frame in question. Credit ratings are influenced by various economic factors and policies, and it's not always clear whether a specific leader's actions directly led to an improvement in the credit rating. Therefore, without specific data or evidence, it's difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
24,"Explanation: The claim that African-American children are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids is an exaggeration. While it is true that African-American children are disproportionately affected by asthma, the mortality rate is not 500 percent higher. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), African-American children are about 2.5 times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma and 2.5 times more likely to die from asthma than white children. This is a significant disparity, but it is not 500 percent.

Answer: 0"
25,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of people killed by U.S. police in a single month to the number killed by U.K. police over a century. This is a misleading comparison because it does not account for the population size, the time period, or the context of each country's law enforcement practices. The U.S. has a much larger population and a higher rate of police interactions, which would naturally lead to a higher number of deaths. The U.K., on the other hand, has a smaller population and a different legal and cultural context. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
26,"Explanation: The claim that the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios is false. In fact, the Rhode Island General Assembly did debate and vote on the loan. The loan was approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly in 2010, with the state providing $75 million to the video game company 38 Studios. This information is well-documented in various news reports and official records.

The claim that 11 soccer players on the USMNT are immigrants is not accurate based on the information available up to that point.

28,"Explanation: The claim that China owns about 29 percent of the U.S. debt is true. As of 2021, China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, with holdings of approximately $1.07 trillion, which is about 29% of the total U.S. debt.

Answer: 1"
29,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2019, which estimated that Americans spend approximately 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax law. The study also estimated that the cost of compliance with tax laws annually is around $163 billion. These figures are derived from the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's annual report to Congress, which provides an analysis of the cost of compliance with the federal tax system.

Answer: 1"
30,"Explanation: The claim that Florida has the second-lowest campaign contribution limit in the entire country is false. According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Florida's campaign contribution limits are actually among the highest in the country. For example, in 2021, the contribution limit for federal candidates in Florida was $2,800 for primary elections and $2,800 for general elections, which is higher than many other states.

Answer: 0"
32,"Explanation: The claim that David Beckham's proposed soccer stadium at Miami's Port threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries is not supported by any credible sources. The economic impact of the stadium on the cargo and cruise industries has not been substantiated, and there is no evidence to suggest that the stadium would directly threaten the jobs and economic impact of these industries. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the potential effects of the stadium's development.

Answer: 0"
33,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies, specifically corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns and got $570 million in job-development incentives, is a complex issue that involves multiple factors. While it is true that Scott Walker's administration provided job-development incentives to various businesses, including those that had contributed to his campaigns, the claim that $570 million was specifically given to his cronies is not supported by verifiable evidence. The amount of $570 million is not explicitly tied to his cronies or campaign contributors in any publicly available records or reports.

Answer: 0"
34,"Explanation: The claim that Burger King is pulling its franchises from military bases due to actions by President Barack Obama is false. There is no credible evidence or official statement from Burger King or any other source indicating that this decision was made as a result of actions taken by President Obama.

35,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the United States has not engaged in a fourth conflict in a foreign land. The U.S. has been involved in conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, but there is no ongoing fourth conflict. Therefore, the claim is false.

Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
37,"Explanation: The claim that a 2005 gay pride vote had nothing to do with discrimination is false. The 2005 gay pride vote was a significant event in the history of LGBTQ+ rights, and it was directly related to discrimination. The vote was held in response to the passage of Proposition 8 in California, which banned same-sex marriage. The vote was a show of support for the LGBTQ+ community and a protest against the discrimination and inequality they faced.

Answer: 0"
38,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt increased $16,000 every second is an exaggeration. While the national debt does increase over time, the rate of increase is not constant and does not reach $16,000 per second. The claim is likely intended to be sensational and is not an accurate representation of the actual increase in the national debt.

Answer: 0"
39,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the current staff size of 51 with the staff size a decade ago. It does not provide specific numbers from a decade ago, so it is impossible to verify the claim without additional information. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0/1"
40,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that detainees at Guantanamo Bay will receive the H1N1 vaccine. The U.S. military has been known to provide medical care to detainees, but there is no public record or official statement confirming that the H1N1 vaccine will be administered to them.

Answer: 0"
41,"Explanation: The claim is asking about a specific political action (voting for a budget) by a specific individual (Rep. Paul Ryan). This type of claim is typically fact-based and can be verified through reliable sources such as news articles, official statements, or public records. Since the claim does not provide any specific context or source, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of the statement without additional information.

Answer: 0"
42,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy is false. The birther controversy, which questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama, began during his 2008 presidential campaign. While Hillary Clinton's campaign did not start the controversy, she did not actively promote it either. The birther movement was primarily led by conservative political figures and individuals who questioned Obama's eligibility to be president.

Answer: 0"
43,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about surveys conducted with Wisconsin employers. While it is possible that some employers have cited the anti-business litigation climate as a factor affecting their expansion decisions, it is not specific enough to be verified as true or false without additional context or data. Surveys can vary in their methodology, sample size, and interpretation, making it difficult to confirm the claim without more detailed information.

Answer: 0"
44,"Explanation: The claim that the Pasco County budget has doubled in the past three years is not accurate. According to the Pasco County's official budget reports, the budget has increased, but not by a factor of two. For example, the budget for the 2019-2020 fiscal year was approximately $1.2 billion, and the budget for the 2022-2023 fiscal year was approximately $1.4 billion. This represents an increase of about 16.7%, not a doubling.

Answer: 0"
45,"Explanation: The claim is false. The FBI Director, Christopher Wray, has not made any public statements about Hillary Clinton's misconduct. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his statements or actions.

Answer: 0"
46,"Explanation: The claim that there were no government benefits for immigrants when the grandfather arrived in the United States is false. While it is true that the current system of government benefits for immigrants is more extensive than it was in the past, there were indeed some forms of assistance available to immigrants in the early 20th century. For example, the Dillingham Commission, established in 1907, recommended that immigrants be provided with assistance in finding jobs and housing. Additionally, some states and cities offered assistance to immigrants through public works programs and other initiatives. Therefore, the claim that there were no government benefits for immigrants is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
47,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal aid for Medicaid expansion is not a tax that can be redirected to other states. Medicaid is a federal program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals and families. When a state chooses not to expand Medicaid, it does not send federal funds to other states. Instead, the federal funds remain with the state that chose not to expand Medicaid. The claim is a misinterpretation of how Medicaid funding works.

Answer: 0"
48,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""a third of all the young people in America are not in America today because of abortion"" is misleading and inaccurate. While it is true that one in three pregnancies in the United States end in abortion, this does not mean that one in three young people are not in America today due to abortion. The claim confuses the number of pregnancies that end in abortion with the number of young people who are not in America. The number of young people in America is not directly affected by the number of abortions.

Answer: 0"
49,"Explanation: Same-sex marriage is a legal recognition of a marriage between two people of the same sex. This practice has been legalized in many countries and is widely accepted in many societies. Therefore, the claim that same-sex marriage is a true statement.

50,"Explanation: Fidel Castro, the former leader of Cuba, was known for his political views and criticisms of various world leaders and governments.

There is no specific context or source mentioned to support this claim.

Answer: 0"
51,"Explanation: The federal gas tax in the United States has indeed been raised since 1993. The current federal gas tax rate is 18.4 cents per gallon for regular gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel fuel, which was last increased in 1993. However, the claim that the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993 is false because it has been raised multiple times since then, including in 1993 itself.

Answer: 0"
52,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker's budget includes ""No weekend for workers"" is a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual policy. Scott Walker, a former governor of Wisconsin, implemented a policy that required state employees to work on Saturdays and Sundays, but this was not a complete elimination of weekends for workers. The policy was aimed at reducing the state's budget deficit and did not mean that all workers would have no weekend at all. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
53,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did not give control of Medicare patients' healthcare decisions to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats. The ACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was intended to make recommendations to Congress on how to reduce Medicare spending. However, the IPAB was never activated, and its powers were repealed in 2019. The claim misrepresents the role and existence of the IPAB.

Answer: 0"
54,"Explanation: The claim that under Hillary Clinton, State Department officials were sending official thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation is false. The Clinton Foundation is a private organization, and it is not appropriate for government officials to send official thank-yous to individuals for donations to a private foundation. This practice would be a violation of government ethics rules and could be seen as a conflict of interest.

Answer: 0"
55,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States is not the only nation that affords citizenship to anyone born within its borders, regardless of the legal status of their parents. Many countries, including Canada, Mexico, and several European nations, have similar policies. For example, Canada's Citizenship Act grants citizenship to anyone born in Canada, regardless of their parents' immigration status. Similarly, Mexico's constitution grants citizenship to anyone born in Mexico, regardless of their parents' immigration status.

Answer: 0"
57,"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood provides about 140 visits for prenatal care in each state is false. Planned Parenthood does provide prenatal care services, but the number of visits per state is not accurate. According to Planned Parenthood's own data, they provide prenatal care to approximately 1.5 million patients annually, but this number is not specific to 140 visits per state.

Answer: 0"
58,"Explanation: The claim that in 41 states, government workers are better paid than the taxpayers who support them is not accurate. While it is true that government workers often have higher salaries and benefits compared to private sector workers, the claim that this is true in 41 states is an oversimplification and not supported by comprehensive data. The claim does not provide specific data or sources to back up the statement, making it difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
59,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain said last year he didn't know of a solution to the mortgage crisis is false. John McCain, a former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate, has publicly discussed and proposed solutions to the mortgage crisis. He has advocated for various measures, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and other financial reforms. Therefore, the claim that he didn't know of a solution is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
60,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney said ""'No' to in-state tuition"" for illegal immigrants is false. Mitt Romney, during his 2012 presidential campaign, did propose a plan to deny in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, but he did not explicitly say ""'No' to in-state tuition"" in the way the claim suggests. The claim is a misrepresentation of Romney's stance.

Answer: 0"
61,"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, it is illegal to perform an abortion without the consent of the pregnant person. Additionally, administering medication to a child without permission is also illegal and unethical. The claim also suggests that it is acceptable to secretly take a child off for an abortion, which is not only illegal but also highly unethical and harmful.

Answer: 0"
62,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about a specific demographic group (single adults, ages 21 to 25 with no kids) and does not provide any specific data or source to support the claim. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time period or the geographical location, which could affect the validity of the statement.

Answer: 0"
63,"Explanation: The claim ""On torture"" is incomplete and lacks context. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
64,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama plans to impose a tax of at least 23 percent on the Medicare prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries is false. There is no evidence or official statement from President Obama or his administration indicating such a plan. Medicare prescription drug benefits are funded through a combination of premiums, taxes, and government contributions, and any changes to these benefits would typically be announced and discussed in the context of broader healthcare reform initiatives.

Answer: 0"
65,"Explanation: The claim is based on a hypothetical scenario and does not provide any specific source or data to support it. President Obama's policies were in effect during the 2008-2016 period, and the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 4.7%. The claim does not provide any evidence or data to suggest that continuing with his policies would lead to a 9% unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the following year.

Answer: 0"
66,"Explanation: The claim is asking for an opinion on how the federal government should spend Florida's rejected high-speed rail money. This is a subjective and political question that does not have a definitive true or false answer. It is a matter of policy and personal belief rather than a factual statement that can be verified as true or false.

Answer: 0"
67,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that Barack Obama has enacted a law that requires healthcare professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government for the purpose of gun confiscation. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law by President Obama, does not include such provisions. Additionally, the ACA does not give the government the authority to confiscate guns based on medical data.

Answer: 0"
68,"Explanation: As of the latest data, the population of Florida is indeed approximately 19 million people. The combined population of the earlier primary and caucus states (such as Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada) is significantly less than 19 million. Therefore, the claim that the population of Florida is larger than all the earlier primary and caucus states combined is true.

Answer: 1"
69,"Explanation: The claim suggests a direct and arbitrary comparison between the cost of an ESD superintendent position and the cost of three speech pathologists, three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers. This comparison is not valid because the roles, responsibilities, and qualifications required for these positions are vastly different. The cost of each position is determined by various factors such as education, experience, and the specific needs of the role, not by a simple numerical ratio. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
70,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama Administration did not close 75 percent of the air traffic control towers in Republican Congressional Districts. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) closed 143 towers between 2013 and 2018, and only 40 of these were in Republican districts. This represents approximately 28 percent, not 75 percent.

Answer: 0"
71,"Explanation: The claim that Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954 is false. Crimea has a complex history, but it was not part of Ukraine until 1954. Before that, it was part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union. In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev, then the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, transferred Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR as part of a territorial reorganization within the Soviet Union. This transfer was not a gift or a gesture but a formal administrative decision.

Answer: 0"
72,"Explanation: The claim is true. A fiduciary responsibility is a legal and ethical obligation to act in the best interests of another party. In the context of a business, this means that the individual has a duty to act in the best interests of the business, its employees, and its shareholders. Paying no more tax than legally required is a way to maximize the value of the business, which aligns with the fiduciary responsibility.

Answer: 1"
73,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rick Scott was not forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud. In fact, Rick Scott was the Governor of Florida from 2011 to 2019 and has not been involved in any such fraud case. The company you are referring to is likely HCA Healthcare, which was involved in a fraud case, but Rick Scott was not the CEO or involved in the company's operations during that time.

Answer: 0"
74,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government restricts how much salt we can put on our food is false. While the U.S. government does recommend limiting salt intake to reduce health risks, it does not impose specific restrictions on the amount of salt individuals can use in their food. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day, but this is a recommendation, not a regulation.

Answer: 0"
75,"Explanation: The claim is false. The NClaw (North Carolina Law) for body camera footage does not give police broad authority to keep video footage secret from individuals who are filmed. In fact, North Carolina law requires that body camera footage be made available to individuals who are the subject of the footage, with certain exceptions for privacy and safety concerns. The law also provides for public access to body camera footage, subject to certain restrictions.

Answer: 0"
76,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific incident involving a 42-inch redfish and fishing rules. Without additional context or verification, it's difficult to determine the authenticity of this claim. However, the claim itself is not inherently impossible; it's plausible that someone could catch a 42-inch redfish and be unable to keep it due to fishing regulations.

77,"Explanation: The claim about the accuracy of state job numbers is complex and depends on the specific context and data source. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, for example, regularly releases data on employment and unemployment rates, which are considered reliable and accurate. However, the accuracy of state-specific job numbers can vary depending on the methodology used by individual states and the reliability of their data collection processes. Therefore, without specific details about the source and methodology of the claim, it is difficult to definitively judge its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
78,"Explanation: The claim that ""Right now we are at 90 percent health insurance covered. That's the highest we've ever been in our country"" is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, the percentage of people without health insurance in the United States was around 8.9%, not 90%. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the data.

Answer: 0"
79,"Explanation: The claim that the No. 1 cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34 is murder is not accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading causes of death for African-American males in this age group are homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries. However, homicide is not the No. 1 cause of death overall. The CDC's data shows that unintentional injuries, such as motor vehicle accidents, are the leading cause of death for African-American males aged 15-34.

Answer: 0"
80,"Explanation: Ron Johnson, a former CEO of J.C. Penney and a current U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, has been actively involved in addressing opioid abuse and heroin addiction. He has introduced legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis, such as the ""Opioid Crisis Response Act"" and the ""Opioid Addiction Prevention Act."" Additionally, he has been vocal about the issue and has participated in various discussions and hearings on the topic. Therefore, the claim that he has done nothing to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse is false.

Answer: 0"
81,"Explanation: The claim is false. While Virginia has been recognized for its business-friendly environment and has been ranked high in various surveys, it has not been named ""best managed state"" or ""best state to raise a child"" during the tenure of any specific governor. These rankings are typically based on comprehensive surveys and studies conducted by independent organizations, and they do not specifically attribute these rankings to any particular governor.

He has advocated for reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that would make it more sustainable and affordable, but he has not supported raising rates for policyholders.

Answer: 0"
83,"Explanation: The claim that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit is false. This claim originated from a series of videos released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress in 2015. However, multiple investigations, including those by the FBI and the Department of Justice, found no evidence to support the claim. The videos were later found to have been heavily edited and misrepresented the context of the conversations. Planned Parenthood has consistently denied the allegations and has stated that it does not sell fetal tissue.

Answer: 0"
84,"Explanation: The claim that the new 21st State Senate district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard and was drawn within half a block of his house is a political allegation that lacks specific evidence or official confirmation. The creation of legislative districts is typically a public process involving input from various stakeholders and is subject to legal and political scrutiny. Without concrete evidence or official statements supporting this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
85,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island's voter identification law was pushed by a black Democrat in the House and a black Democrat in the Senate is false. The Rhode Island voter identification law was actually passed in 2011 by a Republican-controlled legislature. The law was not pushed by any black Democrats in the House or Senate.

Answer: 0"
86,"Explanation: The claim states that Jeff Greene only moved from California to Florida in the last two years and that he would not legally be allowed to run for any other statewide office because he has not lived here long enough to meet the residency requirement. This claim is false because Jeff Greene has been a resident of Florida for more than two years. He has been a resident of Florida since 2018, which means he has met the residency requirement for running for statewide office.

Answer: 0"
87,"Explanation: The claim is false. The individual in question, George W. Bush, was the President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 and was a strong supporter of the war in Iraq. He authorized the invasion in 2003, which was based on the premise that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The invasion was later criticized for its lack of evidence supporting the initial claims.

89,"Explanation: The claim states that manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three years, which contradicts the earlier statement that manufacturers have been shedding jobs for more than 10 years.

Answer: 0"
90,"Explanation: The claim that ""Fifty-one percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009"" is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, in 2009, approximately 46.4% of tax returns did not report any taxable income, which means they did not owe any income tax. However, this does not mean that 51% of households paid no income tax, as some households may have had taxable income but did not owe any tax due to credits or deductions.

Answer: 0"
91,"Explanation: The claim that Majority Leader Eric Cantor called for abolishing Social Security and Medicare is false. While Cantor has been critical of the Social Security system and has proposed reforms, he has never advocated for its complete abolition. This claim is a misrepresentation of his actual stance.

Donald Trump, during his presidential campaign and presidency, made several statements that suggested Muslims would be subject to profiling and other forms of surveillance.

Answer: 0"
93,"Explanation: The claim that Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards was forced to concede that 86 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenue is from abortion is false. While it is true that abortion services are a significant part of Planned Parenthood's work, the claim that 86 percent of their revenue comes from abortion is an exaggeration. According to Planned Parenthood's own financial reports, abortion services account for about 32 percent of their total revenue. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the actual figures.

Answer: 0"
94,"Explanation: According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Georgia spends more on tourism advertising than many other states in the South. For example, in 2019, Georgia spent $15.5 million on tourism advertising, while states like Alabama and South Carolina spent less. Therefore, the claim that Georgia spends fewer tourism advertising dollars than any other state in the South is false.

Answer: 0"
95,"Explanation: The claim that foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unionization rate for all private industry workers in the United States is around 6.5%, while the rate for foreign-owned companies is around 5.5%. This indicates that foreign-owned companies have a slightly lower unionization rate than the overall private industry rate.

Answer: 0"
96,"Explanation: The claim is false. Federal grant funds for the Milwaukee streetcar project are subject to specific conditions and restrictions, but they are not exclusively tied to the streetcar project. The funds can be redirected to other modes of public transportation or to public schools if the project is canceled or if the funds are not used as intended. The claim suggests a rigid restriction that does not align with typical grant fund usage policies.

Answer: 0"
97,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's deal allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon is false. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The deal included strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure Iran's compliance. It did not allow Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.

Answer: 0"
98,"Explanation: The claim that ""nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything"" when the United States first created the federal income tax is false. The federal income tax was implemented in 1913 with the 16th Amendment, and it initially applied to a broad range of incomes. The first tax brackets were set at 1% for incomes up to $3,000, 2% for incomes up to $5,000, and 6% for incomes above $5,000. Therefore, individuals with incomes below $3,000 did not pay any federal income tax, but those with incomes above $3,000 did pay a tax.

Answer: 0"
99,"Explanation: The claim states that there are over 300 state agencies, and 45 of those are related to healthcare. This claim is true because the United States has a large number of state agencies, and many of them are indeed related to healthcare. The exact number of state agencies can vary, but the claim is generally accurate.

Answer: 0"
101,"Explanation: The claim that the premiums on Medicare's prescription drug program have fallen almost every year since it began is not accurate. Medicare Part D, the prescription drug program, has seen fluctuations in premiums over the years, but it has not consistently fallen. Premiums can vary based on factors such as the specific plan chosen, the region, and the year. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

Answer: 0"
102,"Explanation: The claim is false. Mitt Romney did not make the statement ""This plant kills"" while pointing at a coal plant during his time as governor of Massachusetts.

Answer: 0"
103,"Explanation: The claim that ""No other Northeastern state has passed a photo ID law"" is false. Several Northeastern states have implemented photo ID laws. For example, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Connecticut have all passed laws requiring photo ID for voting. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
104,"Explanation: The claim that ""government is a barrier to innovation and development"" is not universally true. While it is true that excessive regulation, bureaucracy, or lack of support can hinder innovation, governments also play a crucial role in fostering innovation through policies, funding, and infrastructure. For instance, many governments provide funding for research and development, create regulatory environments that encourage innovation, and invest in education and infrastructure. Therefore, the claim is not accurate in its entirety.

Answer: 0"
105,"Explanation: The claim about a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in inner-city schools is not accurate. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the overall dropout rate for public schools in the United States was around 5% in 2019. While dropout rates can vary significantly by location and demographic, the claim of a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
106,"Explanation: The claim suggests that individuals should unconditionally follow police orders and then deal with any potential issues later. This advice is not accurate and can be dangerous. When a police officer stops you, it is important to remain calm and cooperative, but you also have rights. You should not feel compelled to follow orders that you believe are illegal or unjust. If you feel that your rights are being violated, you should document the incident and seek legal advice.

Answer: 0"
107,"Explanation: Ohio does not have a law that explicitly allows employers or landlords to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation. In fact, Ohio's Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. Therefore, it is not legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay.

Answer: 0"
108,"Explanation: In Georgia, ride-sharing companies like Uber are required to carry auto insurance. However, the specifics of the insurance coverage can vary depending on the status of the driver (e.g., whether they are currently driving for the company or are off-duty). When a driver is logged into the app and waiting for a ride request, the company's insurance coverage typically applies. When the driver is off-duty, the driver's personal insurance may cover them. Therefore, the claim that Uber and other ride-share firms are not required to carry auto insurance under Georgia law is false.

Answer: 0"
109,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has publicly stated her support for abortion rights, including late-term abortions, but she has also emphasized the importance of reducing the number of abortions.

Answer: 0"
110,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the conversations or the context in which they occurred.

Answer: 0"
111,"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey has the lowest corruption risk of any state due to the #jerseycomeback is not verifiable with the information provided. The #jerseycomeback is a hashtag used to promote a return to normalcy and economic recovery in New Jersey, but it does not directly correlate to a reduction in corruption risk. Corruption risk is typically measured by indices such as Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which is based on various factors including public sector corruption, political corruption, and business corruption. Without specific data or sources to support the claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
112,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a referendum on an aquarium for Clearwater will directly impact future funding for neighborhoods. However, there is no direct correlation between a local referendum on an aquarium and the funding for neighborhoods. The funding for neighborhoods is typically managed by separate budgetary processes and is not directly tied to the outcome of a local referendum on a specific project like an aquarium.

Answer: 0"
113,"Explanation: The claim states that Gov. McAuliffe has vetoed more bills in two years than the previous three governors did in each of their four-year terms. To verify this claim, we would need to compare the number of bills vetoed by Gov. McAuliffe in his first two years in office with the total number of bills vetoed by the previous three governors in their four-year terms. Without specific data on the number of bills vetoed by each governor, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
114,"Explanation: The claim that ""Everything I have said (on the campaign trail) has been factually accurate"" is a subjective statement that cannot be universally verified as true or false without specific examples and context.

Answer: 0/1"
115,"Explanation: The claim that 10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes is false. The Clinton Foundation has been criticized for its spending practices, with some reports suggesting that a significant portion of its funds are used for administrative costs and salaries rather than direct charitable work. The foundation has also faced scrutiny over its donations and the influence of its donors.

Answer: 0"
116,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Social Security system was established in the United States in 1935, during the Great Depression. The average life expectancy at that time was around 61 years for men and 62 years for women. However, the Social Security system was designed to provide benefits to workers who had contributed to the system through payroll taxes. The age at which people could start receiving benefits was initially set at 65, which was higher than the average life expectancy at the time. Therefore, the claim that people died before they were old enough to get Social Security is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
117,"Explanation: The claim is false. The last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate was in 1972, as stated in the claim. However, the claim also states that ""We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate,"" which implies that the 40th anniversary is approaching. Since 1972 was 40 years ago, the claim is false because it suggests that the anniversary is still approaching, which is not the case.

Answer: 0"
118,"Explanation: The claim states that Rob Cornilles has been endorsed by 20 local mayors, including Independent, Democratic, and Republican.

119,"Explanation: The claim that Attorney General Eric Holder was involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation is false. In 2009, the Department of Justice under Holder's leadership did not dismiss the charges against the New Black Panther Party. Instead, the case was dismissed due to a lack of evidence and the government's failure to prove its case. Holder himself was not directly involved in the dismissal of the charges.

Answer: 0"

The newspaper has consistently reported on the topic and has expressed concerns about the practice.

Answer: 0"
122,"Explanation: The claim suggests that a person can drive the length of a football field (approximately 100 yards or 91.44 meters) in five seconds. This is highly unlikely because the average speed required to cover this distance in five seconds would be approximately 182.88 meters per second, which is far beyond the capabilities of any vehicle, including a car or a motorcycle. Even the fastest cars in the world cannot achieve such speeds.

Answer: 0"
123,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the water sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 was equivalent to three years' worth of Austin's water use. This claim is misleading because it does not specify the total amount of water used by Austin in a year. Without knowing the total annual water usage of Austin, it is impossible to accurately compare the water sent to downstream rice farmers to three years' worth of Austin's water use. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
124,"Explanation: Wisconsin does not require a photographic identification to vote. The state allows voters to present a variety of identification documents, including non-photographic ones, such as utility bills, bank statements, or pay stubs. This policy is in line with the state's voter ID law, which was implemented in 2011 but has since been modified to allow for a broader range of acceptable identification documents.

Answer: 1"
125,"Explanation: The claim suggests that learning about Donald Trump's financial dealings can be better understood by examining his financial disclosure form rather than his tax returns. This is false because financial disclosure forms and tax returns serve different purposes and provide different types of information. Financial disclosure forms provide details about assets, liabilities, and income sources, while tax returns provide information about income, deductions, and taxes paid. Both are important for understanding a person's financial situation, but they are not interchangeable. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
126,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified program in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, that guarantees a college savings account for every child who enters kindergarten.

Answer: 0"
127,"Explanation: According to recent data from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, the percentage of women in medical schools has been increasing but is not yet over half. In 2019-2020, women made up 48.5% of medical school students. Similarly, in dental schools, women constituted 58.1% of the student body in 2019-2020. In law schools, women accounted for 49.5% of the student population in 2019-2020. Therefore, the claim that over half of the young people in medical, dental, and law schools are women is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
128,"Explanation: The claim suggests that an opponent's promise to bring back old jobs is based solely on wishing away the global economy, implying that this promise is unrealistic and not grounded in practical solutions. This is a common tactic in political debates to dismiss an opponent's proposals as naive or impractical.

Answer: 0"
129,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, recall petitions are governed by state laws, and the specific rules can vary. However, in most states, including Wisconsin where Governor Scott Walker was governor, a person can only sign one recall petition for a single elected official. Signing multiple petitions for the same official is not allowed, and only the first signature counts. Therefore, the claim that it is legal to sign a recall petition even if you have already signed another recall petition is incorrect.

130,"Explanation: The Rebuild America Jobs Act is a piece of legislation introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2017. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) and Rep. John Delaney (D-MD). There is no record of the claimant co-sponsoring this bill.

131,"Explanation: The claim states that a new report proves the stimulus supported by New Jersey Democrats cost $278,000 per job. However, without specific details about the report, its methodology, and the source of the data, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim. The claim could be true, but it could also be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual data. Therefore, without further information, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
132,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no credible evidence to support the idea that the wives of the 9/11 hijackers knew about the attacks in advance or that they traveled to Saudi Arabia to watch their husbands on television.

Burris was seated in the Senate on January 15, 2009.

Answer: 1"
136,"Explanation: The claim that Obama ""remains silent"" and ""is never asked how he feels about his church honoring Farrakhan"" is false. Former President Barack Obama has publicly addressed his relationship with the Nation of Islam and its leader, Louis Farrakhan. In 2016, he distanced himself from Farrakhan and his organization, stating that he does not support their views. Additionally, he has been asked about his relationship with the church and Farrakhan in various interviews and public appearances.

Answer: 0"
137,"Explanation: The claim that Rep. Jon Runyan voted to redefine rape is false. Rep. Jon Runyan, a Republican from New Jersey, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2009.

Answer: 0"
138,"Explanation: John Paul Stevens was indeed a Protestant, specifically a Lutheran, and he served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1975 to 2010. However, he was not the only Protestant on the court during his tenure. Other justices who were Protestants include Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. Therefore, the claim that John Paul Stevens is the only Protestant on the U.S. Supreme Court is false.

Answer: 0"
139,"Explanation: The claim that Eric Cantor has received more money from oil companies than any other member of Congress this year is not verifiable with the information provided.

Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or sources to support it.

Answer: 0"
140,"Explanation: The claim that Rep. Steve Stockman ""basically wants gun-filled zones in schools"" is a misrepresentation of his actual stance. Rep.

The claim exaggerates and misinterprets his position.

Answer: 0"
141,"Explanation: According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the United States spent $778 billion on military expenditures in 2020. The combined military spending of the next 14 largest nations (excluding the United States) was $1,047 billion.

142,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Iran Nuclear Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), does not include provisions that require Iran to defend itself against Israel, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia if any other country tries to undermine its nuclear program. The JCPOA is an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) that aims to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It does not involve any obligations to defend Iran against other countries.

144,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election, Barack Obama was not running unopposed in Ohio. He faced competition from Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. The claim suggests that more people voted for Obama than for Romney and Santorum combined, which is not possible because the total votes for Obama would be less than the sum of votes for Romney and Santorum.

Answer: 0"
145,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident is true. The U.S. Navy has been operating nuclear-powered ships since the 1950s, and while there have been incidents and accidents involving nuclear reactors, none have resulted in a significant release of radioactive material. The most notable incident was the 1968 nuclear accident on the USS Thresher, which resulted in the loss of the ship and its crew, but this was not a result of a nuclear accident but rather a mechanical failure. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

It is possible that such funding has been secured, but without official documentation or a credible source, the claim cannot be definitively verified.

Answer: 0"
149,"Explanation: The claim is false. The North Carolina government did not use stimulus money to hire a new state worker whose sole job is to apply for more stimulus funds.

156,"Explanation: The claim states that the 2020 U.S. Senate race in Ohio was the closest in 36 years, referring to the 1976 race between Howard Metzenbaum and Robert Taft. However, the 2020 race was between J.D. Vance and Sherrod Brown. The claim is false because it incorrectly identifies the candidates and the year of the closest race.

Answer: 0"
157,"Explanation: The claim is false. The House health reform bill, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), does not put new restrictions on women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market. The AHCA does not change the existing law that allows women to purchase private health insurance plans that cover abortion services. The claim is a misinterpretation of the bill's provisions.

159,"Explanation: The claim that a particular state was the ""worst"" in moving people from welfare to work is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""worst."" Without specific data or context, it's impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true or false. Different states may have different challenges and successes in this area, and what constitutes ""worst"" could vary based on factors such as the state's size, economic conditions, and specific welfare-to-work programs.

Answer: 0"
160,"Explanation: The claim that Cobb is one of the largest school systems in the nation that is debt-free is not accurate. Cobb County School District in Georgia is indeed one of the largest school districts in the nation, but it is not debt-free. As of 2021, Cobb County School District had a debt of approximately $1.2 billion. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
161,"Explanation: The claim ""We've got more revenue than we ever have"" is vague and lacks specific context. Without knowing the entity making the claim and the time frame being referred to, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement. Revenue figures can vary greatly depending on the industry, company size, and economic conditions. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false without additional information.

Answer: 0"
162,"Explanation: The claim that the Social Security disability fund is going belly up in 2016 is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been reporting that the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, which finances Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), is expected to be depleted by 2034, not 2016. This misinformation is likely due to confusion or misinterpretation of the SSA's reports.

Answer: 0"
163,"Explanation: The claim that 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day is an exaggeration. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the suicide rate among veterans is approximately 20 per day, but this figure is not exclusive to older veterans and includes all veterans. The claim also implies that the suicide rate is higher among older veterans, which is not accurate as the rate is consistent across different age groups.

Answer: 0"
164,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language is false. While the U.S. does not have an official language at the federal level, it is not accurate to say that it is one of the very few nations without an official language. Many countries, including the U.S., do not have an official language, but this is not a unique or rare situation. The U.S. has no official language, but English is the de facto national language.

Answer: 0"
165,"Explanation: The claim that the Florida Legislature raised taxes and fees by almost $2 billion in the 2009 session is false. According to the Florida Senate's official website and various news reports from 2009, the 2009 legislative session did not result in a $2 billion increase in taxes and fees. The session primarily focused on budget cuts and other measures to address the state's financial situation during the economic downturn.

Answer: 0"
166,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2021, there were approximately 1.1 million jobs in the clean energy sector, including solar, wind, and energy efficiency. In contrast, the oil and gas industry employed around 1.2 million people. Therefore, the claim that there are more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas is false.

Answer: 0"
167,"Explanation: The claim that the fastest-growing part of the Pentagon's budget are health care expenses is false. The Pentagon's budget primarily consists of expenses related to defense operations, procurement, and personnel costs, not health care. While there are health care expenses for military personnel, these are typically a small portion of the overall budget. The Pentagon's budget is primarily focused on defense-related activities, and the fastest-growing areas are often related to procurement, research and development, and personnel costs.

Answer: 0"
168,"Explanation: The claim that fireworks have never been safer and their use continues to increase each year is not entirely accurate. While it is true that fireworks technology has improved over time, leading to safer products, the statement that they have never been safer is an oversimplification. Additionally, the claim that their use continues to increase each year is not supported by consistent data. Fireworks usage can vary greatly from year to year and is influenced by factors such as local regulations, cultural events, and economic conditions.

Answer: 0"
169,"Explanation: The Medicare program was passed in 1965 as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965. While it is true that the bill had significant Democratic support, it also had some Republican support. The bill was passed with a vote of 307-116 in the House of Representatives and 57-21 in the Senate. While it is accurate to say that the bill had virtually no Republican support in the sense that the majority of Republicans voted against it, it is not entirely accurate to say that it passed with virtually no Republican support.

Answer: 0"
170,"Explanation: The claim about Wisconsin state Senate President Michael Ellis (R-Neenah) breaking Senate rules during debate on a photo ID bill for voters is false.

Answer: 1"
172,"Explanation: The claim is true. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) requires candidates and political committees to file detailed reports on their financial activities.

Answer: 1"
173,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen knew about the Ken Kratz sexting case for nearly a year and did nothing about it is false. The Ken Kratz sexting case involved Ken Kratz, a former Wisconsin district attorney, who was accused of sending inappropriate text messages to a 15-year-old girl. The case was investigated by the Wisconsin Department of Justice, and Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen was not involved in the investigation. The claim is a misinterpretation of the facts and is not supported by any credible sources.

Answer: 0"
175,"Explanation: The claim that ""More businesses went out of business last year than were started for the first time in our history"" is not accurate. While it is true that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant number of business closures, it is not accurate to say that more businesses went out of business than were started. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of business applications for employer identification numbers (EINs) in 2020 was higher than in any previous year, indicating that more businesses were started than in previous years. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
176,"Explanation: The claim that Houston National Cemetery is preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals is false. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which manages national cemeteries, allows for religious leaders to conduct prayers at military funerals. The VA's policy states that religious leaders can participate in the funeral service, and they can lead prayers if requested by the family. There is no evidence to suggest that Houston National Cemetery or any other national cemetery is preventing Christian prayers from being said.

Answer: 0"
177,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the fiscal year 2013 budget to the level of state spending when the speaker took office. Without specific data or context, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim. However, if the speaker is referring to a specific fiscal year and the level of state spending has been publicly reported, it would be possible to verify the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified without additional context.)"
178,"Explanation: The claim states that John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government.

Answer: 0"
179,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about public opinion in Wisconsin regarding collective bargaining rights. However, it does not provide specific data or sources to support the claim that ""two thirds of the people in Wisconsin strongly disagree"" with the idea of permanently taking away these rights. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
180,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin's 6th congressional district has more manufacturing jobs than almost any other in the nation is not accurate. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 6th congressional district in Wisconsin has a significant number of manufacturing jobs, but it does not have the highest concentration of manufacturing jobs in the nation. Other districts, such as those in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, have higher concentrations of manufacturing jobs.

Answer: 0"
181,"Explanation: The claim that Mitch McConnell is the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is a generalization and an oversimplification. While it is true that Mitch McConnell has received significant donations from individuals and organizations associated with the coal industry, it is not accurate to say that he is the only candidate receiving such donations. Many other political figures, including those from both major parties, have received donations from various industries, including coal. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
182,"Explanation: The claim is false. The national debt of the United States is approximately $16 trillion, and if we were to convert this into $1 bills, it would not cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times. The area of Ohio is approximately 44,829 square miles. If we assume each $1 bill has a thickness of 0.0043 inches (the thickness of a typical U.S. banknote), the volume of $1 bills needed to cover Ohio would be far greater than the volume of the state itself. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
183,"Explanation: The claim is referring to a specific situation in 2014 regarding health insurance policies held by individuals in New Hampshire (Granite State). In 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented, and there were changes to health insurance policies and networks.

Answer: 0"
185,"Explanation: Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. During his presidency, he did reach across party lines to achieve significant legislation. For example, he worked with Republicans to pass the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Additionally, he signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was a bipartisan effort. Therefore, the claim that he ""has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done"" is false.

Answer: 0"
186,"Explanation: The claim that former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDS drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa is false. The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) is a non-profit organization that works to improve access to HIV/AIDS treatment in resource-limited settings. It has been involved in providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that CHAI distributed watered-down drugs. The organization has been recognized for its efforts in improving access to quality HIV/AIDS treatment.

Answer: 0"
187,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study of private bail bond systems, which suggests that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states. However, without specific details about the study, its methodology, and the data used, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. Additionally, no-show rates can be influenced by various factors such as the severity of the crime, the defendant's personal circumstances, and the effectiveness of the bail bond system itself. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false without further information.

Answer: 0"
188,"Explanation: The claim suggests that scientists are now advising to leave nuclear waste where it is, implying that the problem of nuclear waste disposal has been solved. However, this is a simplification and not entirely accurate. While some scientists and experts have proposed various methods for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, including leaving it in place under certain conditions, the consensus is that the problem is far from solved. The storage and disposal of nuclear waste remain significant challenges in the field of nuclear energy. Therefore, the claim is misleading and not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
189,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not estimated that it must hire 16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to enforce the federal health care overhaul. The IRS has stated that it will need to hire additional employees to implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but the specific numbers and costs have been subject to debate and are not as straightforward as the claim suggests.

Answer: N/A"
191,"Explanation: The claim that the economy in New Jersey gets $38 billion from businesses at the Shore is not accurate. While the Jersey Shore is a significant economic driver for New Jersey, the total economic impact is not $38 billion. According to various economic reports and studies, the total economic impact of the Jersey Shore is estimated to be around $20 billion to $25 billion annually. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
192,"Explanation: The claim states that the Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. This claim is vague and does not provide specific details about which bills or the exact vote counts. Without specific information, it is impossible to verify the claim's accuracy. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
193,"Explanation: The claim is based on data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the IRS, the top 1 percent of income earners paid 36.7 percent of the taxes in 2019. Similarly, the top 50 percent of income earners paid 97.7 percent of the taxes in 2019. These figures are accurate and are based on official data sources.

Answer: 1"
194,"Explanation: The claim that Milwaukee has the second-highest number of children recovered from sex trafficking is not accurate. According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), the number of children recovered from sex trafficking varies by location, and Milwaukee does not consistently rank as having the second-highest number of recovered children. The NCMEC's data shows that the number of recovered children can fluctuate, and rankings can change from year to year.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
196,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. Constitution does not specify any citizenship requirements for presidential candidates.

Answer: 0"
197,"Explanation: The claim ""House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress"" is not accurate.

The claim is hyperbolic and does not provide specific data or evidence to support the claim of dominance.

Answer: 0"
198,"Explanation: The claim that Americans ""have never paid more for gas at the pump"" is false. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average price of regular gasoline in the United States has been higher in the past, particularly in the 2008 and 2011-2014 periods. The current prices are indeed high, but they are not unprecedented.

Answer: 0"
199,"Explanation: The claim is false. The United States uses the Electoral College system to elect the President, where each state's electoral votes are allocated based on its representation in Congress. Texas, California, and New York have a combined total of 55 electoral votes, which is more than half of the 538 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. However, it is not mathematically impossible for Republicans to elect a president because the remaining states could still vote for a Republican candidate, and the candidate could win the majority of electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.

Answer: 0"
200,"Explanation: The claim that ""close to 90 percent of the population growth in Texas over the last decade was non-Anglo"" is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Texas grew by approximately 10.5 million people between 2010 and 2020. While it is true that a significant portion of this growth is due to immigration, the claim that 90 percent of this growth was non-Anglo is an overstatement. The actual percentage of non-Anglo population growth is likely to be higher than the Anglo population growth, but it is not accurate to say that 90 percent of the total growth was non-Anglo.

Answer: 0"
201,"Explanation: The claim is false. The bipartisan background check amendment, known as the ""Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,"" does not outlaw any gun registry. The act expands background checks to cover more individuals, including those who purchase guns at gun shows and online, but it does not prohibit the creation or maintenance of gun registries. The claim misinterprets the legislation's intent and content.

Answer: 0"
202,"Explanation: The claim states that Rep. John Katko promised he would not vote to defund Planned Parenthood and has done so four times since he has been in office. However, Rep. Katko has consistently voted against defunding Planned Parenthood. According to his voting record, he has voted against defunding Planned Parenthood in 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
203,"Explanation: The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not attribute work-related fatalities to increasing numbers of employees and drivers who cannot read or understand warning signs in English. The BLS reports on various factors contributing to work-related fatalities, such as industry, occupation, and specific hazards, but it does not focus on language proficiency as a primary cause. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of BLS data.

Answer: 0"
204,"Explanation: The claim that Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons because the United States of America said it would ensure its territorial integrity from Russia is true. This is a well-documented historical event. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom. This agreement was formalized in the Budapest Memorandum, where the signatory states (the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom) agreed to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Answer: 1"
205,"Explanation: The claim that waterboarding was used on three terrorists is false. Waterboarding is a form of torture that involves pouring water over a person's face to simulate drowning. While it has been used in the past, the number of individuals subjected to this practice is not accurately stated as ""three terrorists."" The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual number of individuals who were subjected to waterboarding.

Answer: 0"
206,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific statement about the number of cases brought on access to public records over a certain period. To verify this claim, one would need to access official records or reports from the relevant authority that handles such cases.

Answer: 0"
207,"Explanation: The claim that ""nobody in higher education believes Gov. Rick Perry's proposal to serve up $10,000 college degrees is possible"" is a generalization that is not supported by evidence. While there may be some critics or skeptics of the proposal, it is not accurate to say that ""nobody"" in higher education believes it is possible. The proposal has been discussed and debated by various stakeholders in higher education, including educators, administrators, and policymakers. Some may support the idea, while others may have concerns or criticisms. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and is not entirely true.

Answer: 0"
208,"Explanation: According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the total number of violent crimes in Arizona decreased from 2019 to 2020. However, property crimes increased slightly. Therefore, the claim that ""crime is down in Arizona"" is not entirely accurate as it does not account for the increase in property crimes.

Answer: 0"
209,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim, I would need to compare the salaries of faculty members across different universities in New England. However, without specific data or a reliable source, it is challenging to verify the claim. Typically, salary comparisons are based on data from sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or specific university reports. If the claim is based on a reliable source, it would be true; otherwise, it would be false.

Answer: 0/1"
210,"Explanation: Preventive care, such as regular check-ups, vaccinations, and health education, can indeed save the government money in the long run. By identifying and treating health issues early, preventive care can reduce the need for more expensive treatments and hospitalizations. Additionally, preventive care can help manage chronic diseases, which can lead to lower healthcare costs. Therefore, the claim that preventive care does not save the government money is false.

Answer: 0"
211,"Explanation: The claim that Abraham Lincoln tried to buy slaves' freedom in border states and that the states all rejected it is false. Lincoln did propose a plan to compensate slave owners for freeing their slaves, but this was not a direct attempt to buy slaves' freedom. The plan was part of his Emancipation Proclamation, which was not accepted by all border states. However, the claim that all states rejected it is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
212,"Explanation: A 5-cent charge on paper bags is not a tax. A tax is a compulsory financial charge or levy imposed by a government authority on a person or organization for the purpose of raising revenue. A charge on paper bags is typically a fee or surcharge imposed by a retailer or a local government to encourage the use of reusable bags and reduce waste. It is not a tax because it is not imposed by a government authority for the purpose of raising revenue.

Answer: 0"
213,"Explanation: The claim that the U.N. arms treaty will mandate a new international gun registry is false. The United Nations has been working on an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) since 2012, but it does not include provisions for a global gun registry. The ATT aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, but it does not require countries to establish a global registry of firearms. The treaty focuses on transparency and record-keeping in the arms trade, not on individual gun ownership.

Answer: 0"
214,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Rick Scott did not attend his own education summit but attended a Tea Party convention instead. This claim is false because it is not supported by any credible sources or evidence. There is no information provided to verify that Rick Scott did not attend his own education summit, and it is not accurate to imply that he attended a Tea Party convention instead without any evidence.

Answer: 0"
215,"Explanation: The 9-9-9 plan, proposed by Andrew Yang, is a tax reform plan that includes a universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 per month for every American adult. The plan also includes a 10% value-added tax (VAT) on goods and services, and a 10% tax on corporate income. While the UBI component does not raise taxes on those making the least, the VAT and corporate tax increases would indeed raise taxes on many Americans. Therefore, the claim that the 9-9-9 plan does not raise taxes on those making the least is false.

Answer: 0"
216,"Explanation: The claim ""I did not support the sequester"" is a statement made by a person, and without additional context or verification, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness. The sequester refers to a budgetary process in the United States where non-discretionary spending is reduced to meet budgetary targets. The claim could be true or false depending on the specific context and the person making the statement.

Answer: 0"
217,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz voted to cut off Florida veterans and their benefits is false. Rep. Wasserman Schultz has been a strong advocate for veterans' issues and has voted in favor of legislation that supports veterans. There is no evidence to support the claim that she voted to cut off veterans' benefits.

Answer: 0"
218,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government borrows almost $60 billion per week is false. The U.S. federal government's borrowing is typically measured in terms of the debt ceiling and the deficit, not weekly borrowing. The U.S. Treasury Department reports the federal debt on a daily basis, and the weekly borrowing figures are not a standard measure. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the federal debt.

Answer: 0"
219,"Explanation: Clayton County's millage rate is indeed one of the lowest in Metro Atlanta. As of 2021, Clayton County's millage rate was 1.50, which is lower than many other counties in the region.

220,"Explanation: The claim is based on data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. According to the FBI's 2020 Crime in the United States report, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States decreased by 24.5% from 2000 to 2019. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm also decreased, but the percentage is not specified in the FBI report. Therefore, the claim that the number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has declined by nearly 70% is not supported by the data.

Answer: 0"
221,"Explanation: The claim that former President Barack Obama opposes offshore drilling and a gas tax holiday is false.

Answer: 0"
222,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the United States spends more on its military than the next 10, 11, or 12 countries combined. However, the claim suggests that the U.S. spends more than the next 10, 11, or 12 countries combined, which is not accurate. The U.S. spends more than the next 10 countries combined, but not the next 11 or 12.

Answer: 0"
223,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no known requirement for developers to use a specific union contractor, and there is no evidence to suggest that an additional $10 million is being added to any construction project due to this requirement.

225,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence or credible source that supports the statement that a federal judge has sanctioned a Tennessee birther lawyer for bringing a frivolous lawsuit. The term ""birther"" is often used to describe individuals who question the citizenship of U.S. President Barack Obama, but there is no record of a federal judge taking such action against a lawyer in this context.

Answer: 0"
226,"Explanation: The claim states that property taxes in 2009 were $3 billion below those in 2007 due to tax cuts and lower property values. However, without specific data or sources to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Property tax rates and values can be influenced by various factors, and a decrease of $3 billion over two years is a significant change that would typically require detailed economic analysis and data to substantiate.

Answer: 0"
227,"Explanation: The claim that food stamp spending doubled under President Bush and doubled again under President Obama is not accurate. While it is true that food stamp spending increased significantly during both administrations, the claim of doubling is an oversimplification. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food stamp spending increased from $30 billion in 2001 to $78 billion in 2009 under President Bush, and then to $80 billion in 2013 under President Obama. This represents a significant increase, but not a doubling in each case.

Answer: 0"
230,"Explanation: The claim that the cost of a college education increased by 439 percent between 1982 and 2007 is based on a study by the College Board, which reported that the cost of tuition and fees at public institutions increased by 439 percent over that period. However, this figure includes only tuition and fees, not room and board, which are also significant components of the total cost of attendance. Therefore, while the claim is technically true in terms of tuition and fees, it is misleading because it does not account for the full cost of attendance.

Answer: 0"
231,"Explanation: The claim that ""most tips left at Dunkin Donuts don't go to employees"" is false. In the United States, tips are typically distributed to employees, including baristas, through a system called ""tip pooling."" This means that tips are collected and then divided among all employees who work in the establishment. The exact distribution can vary by location and company policy, but the general practice is that tips are shared among the staff.

232,"Explanation: The claim ""On banning assault weapons"" is incomplete and lacks specific context.

Answer: 0"
233,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. loses more on tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes is not accurate. According to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the total amount of tax breaks (or tax expenditures) in the U.S. is significantly less than the total amount of personal income taxes collected. For example, in 2019, the IRS reported that the total amount of tax expenditures was approximately $1.6 trillion, while the total amount of personal income taxes collected was around $1.4 trillion. Therefore, the U.S. does not lose more on tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes.

Answer: 0"
235,"Explanation: The claim that taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals in California are ""a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare"" is misleading. While it is true that some undocumented immigrants may receive certain benefits, such as emergency medical care, it is not accurate to say that these benefits are a ""skyrocketing cost under Obamacare."" Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not provide benefits to undocumented immigrants. The ACA primarily provides benefits to U.S. citizens and legal residents. Additionally, the cost of benefits for undocumented immigrants is not funded by taxpayers but rather by the undocumented immigrants themselves through their own contributions to the healthcare system.

Answer: 0"
236,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""every income tax bracket will increase on Jan. 1, 2011"" is not accurate. The 2010 Tax Relief Act, which was signed into law by President Obama, extended the Bush-era tax cuts for two years, but it did not increase all income tax brackets. The tax cuts were extended for most taxpayers, but some high-income individuals saw their tax rates increase. Therefore, the claim that ""every income tax bracket will increase"" is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
237,"Explanation: The claim that Jeanne Shaheen was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama's political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election is false. The IRS scandal, also known as the ""IRS targeting scandal,"" involved the IRS's practice of scrutinizing conservative and liberal nonprofit groups differently. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Jeanne Shaheen was involved in this plot. The investigation into the IRS targeting scandal did not implicate Jeanne Shaheen.

Answer: 0"
238,"Explanation: The claim is false. The King Street Patriots is a group that promotes conservative and libertarian views, and they have held fundraisers featuring various speakers. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they have ever featured an author who believes that registering the poor to vote is un-American. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of the group's activities.

Answer: 0"
239,"Explanation: The claim is false. The ""Bridge to Nowhere"" was a project that was proposed by Alaska Senator Ted Stevens in 2005. The project was intended to build a bridge to the remote island of Gravina in the Aleutian Islands. However, the project was highly controversial and was eventually canceled. The claim that the senator was one of a dozen who voted against the project is incorrect because the project was never voted on by the Senate.

Answer: 0"
240,"Explanation: The claim is asking about a hypothetical situation where someone is considering running for the U.S. Senate as an independent. This is a general statement about a potential action and does not provide specific information about a particular person or event. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truth or falsity of this claim based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
241,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Bush did not deny health insurance to 3.8 million kids under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In fact, he signed the CHIP reauthorization bill into law in 2009, which expanded the program to cover more children. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
242,"Explanation: The claim is false. Libya does supply oil to China, but it also supplies oil to other countries, including the United States. The statement ""We get no oil from Libya"" is incorrect as the U.S. does receive oil from Libya.

Answer: 0"
243,"Explanation: The claim that there is a Republican plan to end Medicare is false. While there have been discussions and proposals within the Republican Party to modify or reform Medicare, there is no current plan or proposal to completely end the program. Medicare is a significant part of the U.S. healthcare system, and any changes to it would likely be incremental and subject to extensive debate and political process.

Answer: 0"
244,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said it is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets is false.

245,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama supported Ted Kennedy's ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition is false. There is no evidence to suggest that Barack Obama supported such a ban.

Additionally, the amendment was not included in the final version of the crime bill.

Answer: 0"
246,"Explanation: The claim is false. While Texas has been increasing funding for women's health services, the statement that they just increased their level by another $50 million for the next two years is not accurate. The Texas Department of State Health Services has been receiving increased funding for women's health services, but the specific amount of $50 million for the next two years is not supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
247,"Explanation: The claim that Tennessee's higher education funding model is 100 percent outcomes-based and that this model is already changing the way postsecondary institutions do business is not entirely accurate. While Tennessee has implemented a performance-based funding model, it is not exclusively outcomes-based. The model includes factors such as student retention, graduation rates, and other performance metrics, but it also considers other factors like institutional size and student demographics. Therefore, the claim that it is 100 percent outcomes-based is an overstatement.

Answer: 0"
248,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Islanders pay among the highest auto repair bills in the nation is not supported by reliable data. While Rhode Island may have higher costs for certain services, it is not accurate to say that it consistently ranks among the highest in the nation. Costs for auto repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific service, the location within the state, and the type of vehicle. Therefore, the claim is not true.

Answer: 0"
249,"Explanation: The claim is true. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that a particular U.S. Senator is running for re-election. However, it is a common practice for U.S. Senators to run for re-election, and many do so regularly. Therefore, the claim is not specific enough to be false, and it is a plausible scenario.

Answer: 1"
250,"Explanation: The claim that overdosing is now the number one accidental killer in the Commonwealth is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading cause of accidental death in the United States is unintentional injuries, which include motor vehicle accidents, falls, and drowning.

The Georgia Department of Corrections has reported savings from various initiatives, but the total savings are not as high as the claim suggests.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
259,"Explanation: The claim that the Ryan budget gets rid of Medicare in 10 years and turns it into a voucher program is false. The Ryan budget, proposed by then-Rep. Paul Ryan in 2011, did propose changes to Medicare, including a shift to a voucher system for future beneficiaries. However, it did not eliminate Medicare entirely. The voucher system would have provided beneficiaries with a set amount to purchase private insurance, but Medicare would have continued to exist for current beneficiaries. The claim that Medicare would be eliminated in 10 years is a misrepresentation of the Ryan budget's proposals.

Answer: 0"
260,"Explanation: The claim about the increase in the garbage tax imposed by Mayor Allan Fung in Cranston being as much as $200 is not supported by any reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
262,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA does not require Americans to give up their current health plans. Instead, it provides options for those who may not have access to affordable coverage or want to change their plans. The prediction that 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan is a misrepresentation of the ACA's impact. The ACA aims to expand coverage, not to force people to change their plans.

Answer: 0"
263,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific action taken by the individual in their role as a State Legislator. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting records of the legislator for any tax increase bills they voted on. Without access to this specific data, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be accurately judged as true or false.

Answer: N/A"
264,"Explanation: The claim that the U.S. is spending millions for each individual held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is not accurate. The cost of detaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay is not primarily based on the number of detainees but rather on the overall operational costs of the facility. The U.S. government has not publicly disclosed the exact cost per detainee, but it is known that the total cost of the detention facility and operations is significant. However, the claim that spending is directly proportional to the number of detainees is misleading.

266,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama won't use the term ""war on terrorism"" is false. During his presidency, Barack Obama frequently used the term ""war on terrorism"" in his speeches and policy statements. For example, in his 2009 speech at the National Defense University, he stated, ""We must also recognize that our military efforts alone will not be enough to defeat the terrorists."" This statement, among others, demonstrates that he did indeed use the term.

Answer: 0"
267,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Senate opponent Tammy Baldwin supported a federal budget that spent trillions more money than the Obama budget is misleading. The federal budget for the fiscal year 2021, which was signed into law by President Biden, was approximately $4.8 trillion. The federal budget for the fiscal year 2016, which was the last full year of the Obama administration, was approximately $3.9 trillion. While the 2021 budget is larger than the 2016 budget, the difference is not in the trillions but rather in the hundreds of billions. Additionally, the claim does not specify which budget Tammy Baldwin supported, and her voting record does not indicate support for a budget that spent trillions more than the Obama budget.

Answer: 0"
268,"Explanation: The claim is false. The debt increased by 100% under President Obama, not 23%. The debt increased from $10.6 trillion to $19.9 trillion during his presidency, which is a 90% increase. The claim also incorrectly states that this was less than under any president going back to Ronald Reagan. In fact, the debt increased by 100% under George W. Bush and by 100% under Ronald Reagan.

Answer: 0"
269,"Explanation: The claim that you spent only $36.29 on your campaign for governor is highly unlikely. Campaigns for governor, especially in the United States, typically involve significant expenditures. The $36.29 figure is suspiciously low for such a campaign, which usually involves large sums of money for advertising, staff salaries, travel, and other expenses. Therefore, this claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
270,"Explanation: The claim that the number of terrorists has doubled is not supported by reliable data or sources. The number of terrorist incidents and groups has fluctuated over time, but there is no evidence to suggest a doubling in the past few years. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of current trends.

Answer: 0"
271,"Explanation: Medical cannabis oil, like other forms of cannabis, contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the compound responsible for the psychoactive effects. Therefore, it is possible for medical cannabis oil to get you high, especially if it is not properly dosed or if the user is not experienced with cannabis. The claim that medical cannabis oil cannot get you high is false.

Answer: 0"
272,"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion a year in Florida, and that this amounts to $700 for every household in Florida, is based on a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). However, the methodology and assumptions used in this study have been criticized by other researchers and organizations. The study's calculations are not universally accepted, and the actual costs of illegal immigration are subject to debate. Therefore, the claim cannot be considered definitively true without further verification and context.

Answer: 0"
273,"Explanation: The claim is false. The bill in question, known as the Continuing Resolution (CR), did not include funding for Planned Parenthood. However, it did not explicitly defund Planned Parenthood either. The claim is misleading because it suggests that there is no money for Planned Parenthood in the bill, which is not accurate as the bill did not address funding for Planned Parenthood at all.

Answer: 0"
274,"Explanation: The claim about the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank is true. The Export-Import Bank of the United States is a government-owned bank that provides financing to U.S. exporters. It was reauthorized in 2018 by the U.S. Congress, extending its authorization until 2022.

Answer: 1"
275,"Explanation: The claim that ""We already have $23 billion worth of debt"" is not specific enough to be evaluated as true or false without additional context. The term ""we"" is ambiguous and could refer to a country, a company, or an individual. Additionally, the claim does not specify the time period or the entity to which the debt belongs. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of this claim without more information.

Answer: 0"
276,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require industry approval before issuing a recall. Once the source of a contamination is identified, the FDA can issue a recall immediately to protect public health. The process of recalling products is governed by regulations and procedures that do not involve waiting for industry approval.

Answer: 0"
277,"Explanation: The claim states that the private sector has invested more than double the amount invested by the public sector at Quonset Business Park. To verify this claim, I would need specific data on the investments made by both sectors. Without such data, it is impossible to accurately assess the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"
278,"Explanation: The claim that Wall Street hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a sheet metal worker in Parma or a school teacher in Cleveland is generally true. Hedge fund managers often have access to various tax strategies and deductions that can lower their effective tax rates. For example, they may use complex investment structures, such as partnerships and LLCs, which can provide significant tax advantages. On the other hand, the sheet metal worker and school teacher typically have more straightforward tax situations, with less opportunity for tax avoidance strategies. Therefore, the claim is supported by the general principles of tax law and the different tax treatment of various income sources.

Answer: 1"
279,"Explanation: The claim that Harry Reid and Senate Democrats only took action on veteran healthcare after news broke about veterans dying due to inadequate care is a simplification of the timeline of events. While it is true that the issue gained significant attention and momentum after reports of veteran deaths, it is not accurate to say that no action was taken before. In fact, there have been ongoing efforts and legislation related to veteran healthcare for many years. The claim also overlooks the broader context of political and legislative processes that involve multiple factors and stakeholders.

Answer: 0"
280,"Explanation: Rick Perry, the former Governor of Texas, has publicly stated that he believes in the right of states to secede from the union. However, he has also stated that he does not support secession at this time. Therefore, while he has expressed a desire for states to have the right to secede, he has not actively sought to secede from the union himself.

Answer: 1"
281,"Explanation: The claim that a Medicaid provision added to the Senate health care reform bill is ""not a special deal for Nebraska"" is false. The provision in question, known as the Nebraska Option, was indeed a special deal for Nebraska. It allowed the state to keep its existing Medicaid program, which was more generous than the standard Medicaid program, and receive federal funding to cover the costs. This provision was included in the bill to secure Nebraska's support for the legislation.

Answer: 0"
282,"Explanation: The claim that Warren Buffett has publicly said his secretary should not be paying a higher tax rate than him is false.

The misattribution of this statement is a common example of misinformation.

Answer: 0"
283,"Explanation: The claim is false. The 113th Congress, which met from 2013 to 2015, passed 288 bills into law, not 67. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the actual number of bills passed.

Answer: 0"
284,"Explanation: Georgia's gun laws are generally considered to be relatively permissive compared to many other states. However, it is not accurate to say that Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation. Several other states, such as Alaska, Arizona, and Wyoming, have even fewer restrictions on gun ownership and use. Therefore, the claim that Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation is false.

Answer: 0"
285,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump required every school in America to let people carry guns into classrooms on his very first day in office is false. While Trump did propose to arm teachers and school staff, he did not mandate that every school must allow people to carry guns into classrooms. His proposal was to allow states and local school districts to decide whether to arm teachers and staff, not to require it nationwide.

Answer: 0"
286,"Explanation: The claim is based on a report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is a business advocacy group. The report's findings are often criticized for being overly pessimistic and not accounting for potential economic benefits or job creation in other sectors. The specific figures of 244,000 jobs lost and $1,200 additional cost per family are disputed by many economists and environmental groups. The Chamber of Commerce's reports are often used to argue against environmental regulations, but their methodology and conclusions are not universally accepted.

Answer: 0"
287,"Explanation: The claim is about a Massachusetts governor erasing electronic communications as he left office. This practice is not uncommon among public officials, as it is often done to protect personal privacy and avoid potential misuse of public records. However, the claim does not specify which governor or provide any evidence to support the claim. Therefore, without specific details or evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim's authenticity.

Answer: 0"
288,"Explanation: The claim that ""many states are floundering under crushing deficit spending"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While some states may indeed face significant budgetary challenges, it's not accurate to say that ""many"" states are in this situation. The financial health of states varies greatly, and some states are actually experiencing surpluses or have balanced budgets. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
289,"Explanation: The claim is false. Planned Parenthood does provide mammograms as part of their health services.

Answer: 0"
290,"Explanation: According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, in 2019, Medicaid covered 45.5% of births in Texas. This is less than half, so the claim that ""more than half of the births in Texas are paid for by Medicaid"" is false.

Answer: 0"
291,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama never made such a suggestion. The misquote originated from a Republican political ad during the 2010 midterm elections, which distorted and misrepresented his actual words. Obama's actual statement was about the potential for cost savings in the healthcare system, not about individual healthcare decisions.

Answer: 0"
292,"Explanation: The claim that ""We have had some significant accomplishments on a bipartisan basis"" is vague and does not provide specific details about the accomplishments or the context in which they were achieved. Without specific examples or evidence, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness of this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
293,"Explanation: The claim that ""most of Perry's chiefs of staff have been lobbyists"" is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to research the specific individuals who have served as chiefs of staff for Perry and their professional backgrounds. Without this specific information, it is impossible to determine the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0"
294,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton has said that NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) was a boon to the economy is false. Hillary Clinton has been critical of NAFTA throughout her political career, including during her 2016 presidential campaign. She has argued that NAFTA has led to job losses in the United States and has not been beneficial to the economy. Therefore, the claim that she has said NAFTA was a boon to the economy is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
295,"Explanation: The claim that Russ Feingold was the only senator to vote against the Homeland Security Act is false. While Russ Feingold was one of the few senators who voted against the act, he was not the only one. Several other senators also voted against it. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and inaccurate.

296,"Explanation: The claim is false. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat from Alaska, did not cast the deciding vote in favor of President Obama's executive amnesty for illegal aliens. The executive action, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), was announced by President Obama in November 2014. However, it was blocked by a federal court and never went into effect. Sen. Begich did not play a role in the decision-making process regarding this executive action.

Answer: 0"
297,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the U.S. economy has shown signs of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, with GDP growth and employment figures improving. However, the pace of recovery can vary depending on the specific economic indicators and sectors being considered. Europe, on the other hand, has also been recovering, but the pace of recovery can differ between countries and regions within Europe. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the U.S. economy is recovering slower than Europe overall, as the recovery rates can be comparable or even faster in some European countries.

Answer: 0"
298,"Explanation: The claim that Allen West violated federal law by scuba diving with a U.S. flag is false. There is no federal law that prohibits scuba diving with a U.S. flag.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional information.)"
300,"Explanation: The claim states that the building in question is not a mosque but a cultural center with a prayer area. This claim is true because a mosque is a place of worship specifically for Muslims, while a cultural center can be a place for various cultural activities and may include a prayer area for Muslims. The claim does not contradict the definition of a mosque, and it accurately describes the building as a cultural center with a prayer area.

Answer: 1"
301,"Explanation: The claim that the odds of winning the Monopoly Millionaire instant win game are 1 in 3.27 is false. The odds of winning such games are typically much higher than 1 in 3.27. For example, the odds of winning a typical instant win game are often around 1 in 10 or 1 in 20, depending on the specific game and its rules. The claim of 1 in 3.27 is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual odds.

Answer: 0"
302,"Explanation: The claim that many citizens think a significant portion of the federal budget is devoted to foreign aid is not necessarily false, but it is not accurate to say that a full quarter or even a third of the federal budget is allocated to foreign aid. According to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the total amount of foreign aid in the U.S. federal budget is typically around 1% of the total federal budget. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
303,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal government does not typically provide loans to foreign state-owned companies for exploration activities. Such activities are usually conducted by private companies or through international agreements and partnerships. The U.S. government's role in energy exploration is typically limited to regulatory and policy-making, rather than direct financial support.

Answer: 0"
304,"Explanation: The claim that the United States had declared war on Islam over 200 years ago and that Thomas Jefferson led the charge is false. The United States has never declared war on Islam as a whole. The Barbary Wars, which were fought in the early 19th century, were conflicts between the United States and the Barbary States (Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli) over piracy and tribute. Thomas Jefferson was involved in these conflicts, but they were not directed against Islam as a religion. The claim misrepresents the historical context and the role of Thomas Jefferson.

Answer: 0"
305,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific political action and its impact on a particular organization. However, without specific details about the state, the Republican leadership, and the exact budget cuts, it is difficult to verify the claim.

Answer: 0"
306,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has seen a net loss of people with health insurance because of Obamacare is false. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the uninsured rate in the United States has been declining since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In 2010, the uninsured rate was 16.0%, but by 2019, it had dropped to 8.9%. This indicates that more people have gained health insurance coverage, not a net loss.

The claim is likely a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the actual procedures in place.

Answer: 0"
309,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney is proposing a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country is false. Romney's tax plan, as proposed during his 2012 presidential campaign, included a reduction in the top tax rate for the wealthy, but it did not specify a $250,000 tax cut for every millionaire. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresentation of Romney's actual proposal.

Answer: 0"
310,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the budget of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to the amount banks generate from late fees and overdraft fees. While it is true that banks generate significant revenue from these fees, the claim does not provide specific figures or sources to support the statement that the CFPB's budget is only about 1 percent of this amount. Without concrete data, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

The number of law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty in the United States in 2023 is not 83, and the number of officers shot and killed in cold blood is not 24. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, as of October 2023, 103 law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty in the United States in 2023. The number of officers shot and killed in cold blood is 41.

Answer: 0"
312,"Explanation: The claim that repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied by Hillary Clinton's State Department is a misrepresentation of the facts. The Benghazi attacks occurred on September 11, 2012, and there were indeed requests for additional security. However, these requests were not routinely denied. The State Department had been providing security upgrades and additional personnel, but the specific requests for more security on the day of the attacks were not denied. The claim is often used to imply that Hillary Clinton was responsible for the attacks, which is not supported by the evidence.

Answer: 0"
313,"Explanation: The claim states that there has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of a specific city. This claim is false because there have been instances where aldermen have defeated incumbent mayors. For example, in the 2019 election in Chicago, Alderman George Cardenas defeated incumbent Mayor Rahm Emanuel in the Democratic primary for mayor. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
314,"Explanation: The claim ""On running a civil and polite campaign"" is a statement about the nature of a campaign, not a specific event or fact. It does not provide any verifiable information that can be checked for truthfulness. Therefore, it cannot be judged as true or false based on the information given.

Answer: 0"
315,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about the plant, the reason for its closure, and the company responsible. Without additional context or verification, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
316,"Explanation: The claim is based on demographic projections, which are subject to change and uncertainty. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Latino population in Texas is indeed growing rapidly, and it is projected to become the largest ethnic group in the state by 2025. However, the claim specifies a timeframe of ""five to eight to ten years,"" which is more precise than the Census Bureau's projection. Therefore, while the overall trend is accurate, the specific timeframe is uncertain.

Answer: 0"
317,"Explanation: The claim that the only segment in the beer market that is growing is the craft beer segment is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the craft beer segment has been growing significantly in recent years, other segments of the beer market, such as premium and imported beer segments, have also shown growth. Additionally, the overall beer market has been experiencing a steady growth in certain regions, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification of the market trends.

Answer: 0"
318,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, the claim that a $15-an-hour proposal in Cleveland is the most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country is not accurate. While Cleveland has proposed a significant increase in its minimum wage, there are other cities and states that have implemented or proposed even higher minimum wages. For example, Seattle has a minimum wage of $15 per hour, and some states like California have proposed or implemented higher minimum wages. Therefore, the claim that Cleveland's proposal is the most aggressive is not true.

Answer: 0"
319,"Explanation: The claim that 90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate in Morocco is not accurate. According to the latest data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the literacy rate for women in Morocco is around 65.5% as of 2019. This data suggests that the claim is exaggerated and not supported by reliable sources.

Answer: 0"
320,"Explanation: The claim that the Multnomah County Library system is the second busiest in the nation is not accurate. According to the American Library Association's 2021 statistics, the Multnomah County Library system is the 10th busiest in the nation in terms of circulation. The claim may have been based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the data.

Answer: 0"
321,"Explanation: The claim about Senator McCain's education policy is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information indicating that Senator McCain has proposed or is advocating for an increase in the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his actual policy positions.

Answer: 0"
322,"Explanation: The claim that there are mandatory ultrasounds before abortions is false. While some states in the United States have laws requiring ultrasounds before abortions, these are not mandatory nationwide. The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) struck down a Texas law that required ultrasounds before abortions, and similar laws in other states have been challenged or struck down as well. Therefore, the claim that there are mandatory ultrasounds before abortions is false.

Answer: 0"
323,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton's State Department sent three comedians to India on the ""Make Chai, Not War"" tour is false. There is no evidence or record of such an event. Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and while she did engage in various diplomatic efforts, there is no known initiative involving a tour by comedians to promote peace.

Answer: 0"
324,"Explanation: The claim that the intelligence community can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism is false. The U.S. intelligence community, including the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is subject to strict legal and regulatory oversight to prevent the collection of information on law-abiding Americans without a valid legal basis. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and other laws require a specific legal process and probable cause to collect information on U.S. citizens. The collection of business records on law-abiding Americans without a connection to terrorism would violate these laws and regulations.

Answer: 0"
325,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific incident involving Wisconsin state Sen. Jim Holperin and recall petitions. While it is possible for such incidents to occur, the claim itself does not provide concrete evidence or sources to verify the authenticity of the harassment. Without specific details or credible sources, it is difficult to confirm the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0"
326,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, Virginia's state and local governments contributed 47.5% of the total funding for public education, while the federal government contributed 8.3%. The remaining 44.2% was covered by local sources. Therefore, Virginia is not responsible for funding 55% of public education and is not paying just 41%.

Answer: 0"
327,"Explanation: The claim that uncompensated care has gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months of Medicaid expansion in the states that adopted it is not accurate. While Medicaid expansion has been shown to reduce uncompensated care, the 30 percent figure is not supported by reliable data or studies. The actual reduction in uncompensated care varies by state and is typically in the range of 10-20 percent, according to studies by the Commonwealth Fund and other reputable sources.

Answer: 0"
328,"Explanation: The claim is a generalization and does not provide specific data or examples to support its assertion. Economic growth and tax policy are influenced by numerous factors, and correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time capital gains tax has been cut, the economy has grown, or that raising it has damaged the economy.

Answer: 0"
329,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no publicly available information or credible sources that confirm that David Axelrod has become a campaign advisor for Jason Carter. David Axelrod is a prominent political strategist and consultant, but his current affiliations and activities are not publicly linked to Jason Carter's campaign.

Answer: 0"
330,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama is the first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials is false. The term ""czar"" is often used to describe high-ranking officials in the executive branch who are appointed by the president. While it is true that Obama appointed a number of czars, the number 45 is not accurate. The actual number of czars appointed by Obama is around 20-25, depending on the source and the definition of ""czar."" Additionally, the claim that these czars replaced elected officials is misleading, as czars are typically appointed to oversee specific policy areas and do not replace elected officials.

Answer: 0"
331,"Explanation: The claim that Florida seniors are exempt from losing Medicare Advantage under the federal health care bill is false. The Medicare Advantage program is a part of the Medicare program that provides health coverage through private insurance companies. The federal health care bill, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not exempt Florida seniors from losing Medicare Advantage. The ACA actually expanded Medicare Advantage by providing additional benefits and protections for beneficiaries. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
332,"Explanation: Pat Toomey, a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, has been known for advocating for lower corporate taxes. However, he has not advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes.

Answer: 0"
333,"Explanation: The claim that ""Today and every day, an estimated 14,000 Americans will lose their health insurance coverage"" is based on a study by the Commonwealth Fund, which estimated that 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance coverage each day due to job loss, reduced hours, or other reasons. This claim is true.

Answer: 1"
334,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general perception of public opinion rather than specific data. While it is true that many people in the U.S. believe in more equitable distribution of wealth, the exact figure of ""nearly 6 out of 10"" is not supported by any specific survey or study. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable and can be considered as potentially false.

Answer: 0"
335,"Explanation: The claim is false. The president in question is Joe Biden, and he has indeed criticized Israel for its settlement activities in the West Bank. However, he has also addressed the rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip. In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021, Biden condemned the rocket attacks and called for a ceasefire. Therefore, the claim that he said nothing about the rocket attacks is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
336,"Explanation: The claim that ""In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation"" is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""most restrictive."" Voter ID laws can vary in their requirements, such as the types of IDs accepted, the process for obtaining IDs, and the penalties for non-compliance. Without specific details about the bill in question and a comparison with other voter ID laws across the nation, it is not possible to definitively determine if this bill is the most restrictive.

Answer: 0"
337,"Explanation: The claim is about a personal recommendation made by the speaker, which is not a verifiable fact. It is not possible to independently verify whether the speaker recommended Ohio as a convention city for the GOP. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on available information.

Answer: 0"
338,"Explanation: The claim that Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts is partially true. The federal government has provided funding and equipment to local law enforcement agencies through programs like the 1033 Program, which allows the transfer of excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies. However, the extent to which this has led to a militarization of local police precincts is a topic of ongoing debate and criticism.

Answer: 1"
339,"Explanation: The claim that the majority of people trespassing in Arizona are now becoming drug mules is not supported by credible evidence or official statistics. While there have been instances of drug trafficking and human smuggling in Arizona, it is not accurate to say that the majority of trespassers are involved in these activities. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the situation.

Answer: 0"
340,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama played over 90 rounds of golf as president is false. While it is true that Obama enjoyed golf, the number of rounds he played is often exaggerated. According to various sources, including the White House, Obama played around 300 rounds of golf during his presidency, which is significantly more than 90 rounds.

Answer: 0"
341,"Explanation: The claim that this year's redistricting process in Tennessee has been the most open, interactive, and transparent in history is subjective and depends on the specific criteria used to define ""most open,"" ""most interactive,"" and ""most transparent."" Without specific data or evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to definitively judge its truthfulness. However, if the claim is based on general public perception or specific improvements in the process compared to previous years, it could be considered true.

Answer: 1"
342,"Explanation: The claim that ""100% of electric generation comes from coal"" in the 18th Congressional District is false. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the 18th Congressional District in Texas has a mix of energy sources, including coal, natural gas, and renewable energy sources like wind and solar. The district does not rely solely on coal for its electric generation.

Answer: 0"
343,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama is the first president to think he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore is false. While it is true that presidents have the power to enforce or not enforce certain laws, this is not a new concept. Presidents have always had this discretion, and it is a part of the executive branch's role in the U.S. government. The claim is an oversimplification and a misrepresentation of the president's role and the U.S. legal system.

Answer: 0"
344,"Explanation: The claim that Charlie Crist ""worked with Acorn"" to give felons voting rights is false. Acorn (Community Organizing and Research Center) is a progressive community organizing group that was active in the 2000s, but it disbanded in 2010. Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor and U.S. Senator, has never been associated with Acorn or any of its activities. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
345,"Explanation: The claim about support for gay marriage is a broad and complex topic that can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and time period. As of my last update in October 2023, support for gay marriage has been increasing globally, with many countries legalizing it. However, there are still regions and groups that do not support it. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true in many contexts, but not universally true.)"
346,"Explanation: The claim that Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close is a simplification of a complex political issue. While it is true that Republicans have been reluctant to close certain tax loopholes, especially those that benefit businesses and high-income individuals, it is not accurate to say they refuse to list any tax loophole they are willing to close. There have been instances where Republicans have proposed closing specific loopholes, such as the carried interest loophole, as part of broader tax reform discussions. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
347,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the Federal Reserve, as of the first quarter of 2021, the total amount of student loan debt in the United States was approximately $1.7 trillion. This is indeed more than the total credit card debt, which was around $800 billion in the same period.

Answer: 1"
348,"Explanation: The claim is false. Marco Rubio has publicly stated that he supports restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences, including those who have served time for non-violent offenses. He has also expressed support for certain gun control measures, but his stance on felons owning guns after serving their time is not as clear-cut as the claim suggests. The claim misrepresents his position on both issues.

Answer: 0"
349,"Explanation: The claim is false. To calculate the time it would take to pay out $1 trillion at a rate of $1 per second, we need to convert $1 trillion to seconds. $1 trillion is equal to 1,000,000,000,000 dollars. At a rate of $1 per second, it would take 1,000,000,000,000 seconds to pay out $1 trillion. To convert seconds to years, we divide by the number of seconds in a year (365.25 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute). This calculation yields approximately 31,709 years, not more than 31,000 years.

Answer: 0"
350,"Explanation: The Chevrolet Volt is an electric vehicle (EV) with a gasoline engine for extended range. The vehicle's design and safety features are optimized for the unique characteristics of an EV, which includes the placement of the battery pack and other components. Installing a gun rack in a Volt could potentially interfere with the vehicle's electrical systems, battery pack, or other critical components, and may not be safe or recommended by the manufacturer. Therefore, it is not advisable to put a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt.

Answer: 0"
351,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States imposes a penalty on individuals who do not have health insurance and do not qualify for an exemption. This penalty is calculated as a percentage of the individual's income or a flat dollar amount, whichever is higher. The penalty is not lower than the cost of buying insurance; in fact, it is designed to encourage people to purchase health insurance. The penalty is intended to be a disincentive to avoid the cost of health insurance, not to be lower than the cost of insurance itself.

Answer: 0"
352,"Explanation: The claim that the government is spending 40 percent more than what it takes in is a simplification of the government's fiscal situation. The U.S. government's spending and revenue are influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, policy decisions, and tax revenues. While it's true that the government's spending can exceed its revenue in certain periods, the claim of a 40 percent overspending is not accurate and is an oversimplification. The actual figures would need to be examined in detail to provide a precise assessment.

Answer: 0"
353,"Explanation: The claim that the biggest contribution behind a decrease in U.S. unemployment was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce is false. The decrease in unemployment is primarily attributed to the economic recovery and job growth, not to people leaving the workforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate decreased due to an increase in the number of people employed, not a decrease in the labor force participation rate.

Answer: 0"
354,"Explanation: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdoses are indeed a significant cause of death in the United States, including New Hampshire. However, the claim that drug overdoses are the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire is not accurate. The most common causes of death in New Hampshire are heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries, with drug overdoses being a significant but not the second-most common cause.

Answer: 0"
355,"Explanation: David Cicilline served as the Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island from 2006 to 2010. During his tenure, he did not explicitly declare Providence a sanctuary city. While he did advocate for policies that were more welcoming to immigrants, such as providing city services to undocumented immigrants, he did not officially designate the city as a sanctuary city. Therefore, the claim that Congressman Cicilline espoused a sanctuary city while he was the mayor of Providence is false.

Answer: 0"
356,"Explanation: The claim that 70 percent of Virginia's Medicaid costs are for seniors in nursing homes is not accurate. According to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, in 2020, about 40% of Medicaid spending in Virginia was for long-term care services, which includes nursing home care. However, this does not mean that 70% of Medicaid costs are specifically for seniors in nursing homes. The claim is an exaggeration and is therefore false.

Answer: 0"
357,"Explanation: The claim states that less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered by a referendum to levy a 1-cent sales tax. This claim is false because the sales tax is intended to cover a significant portion of Atlanta's transportation needs. The 1-cent sales tax is expected to generate approximately $1 billion annually, which is a substantial contribution to the city's transportation infrastructure. Therefore, the claim that it covers less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
358,"Explanation: The claim that former U.S. President Barack Obama described Iran as a ""tiny"" country and said it doesn't pose a serious threat is false. There is no evidence or record of Obama making such statements.

Answer: 0"
359,"Explanation: The claim that Mitt Romney believes the Arizona SB 1070 immigration law should be the model for national immigration laws is false. During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney did not endorse SB 1070 as a model for national immigration laws. Instead, he criticized the law and stated that it was not the right approach. He proposed a more comprehensive immigration reform plan that included border security, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and other measures.

Answer: 0"
360,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the photographs or the context in which they were released. Without concrete information, it is impossible to verify the authenticity or truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the given information.

Answer: 0"
361,"Explanation: The claim suggests that attorney general candidate Jon Richards stated he would only enforce laws with which he personally agreed. This is a significant and unusual stance for a candidate for attorney general, as the role typically involves enforcing all laws, regardless of personal agreement. Such a statement would be highly unusual and likely not accurate based on standard expectations for the role. There is no credible source provided to support this claim, and it is not a typical position for a candidate to take.

Answer: 0"
362,"Explanation: The pass rate for a high school level test to join the military can vary depending on the specific test and the military branch. However, the claim that the pass rate is 35 to 40 percent is not accurate. The actual pass rates are typically higher, often around 70 to 80 percent for the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), which is the test used by the U.S. military to assess potential recruits.

Answer: 0"
363,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statistic that is often cited in discussions about poverty in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2021, approximately 37.2 million people in the United States were living in poverty. Among these, about 12.5 million were children. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

Answer: 1"
364,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data shows that Wisconsin has experienced job growth under both Democratic and Republican administrations. According to BLS data, Wisconsin's employment increased by 11.5% from 2011 to 2021, with significant job growth occurring during the Democratic administration of Governor Tony Evers. Therefore, the claim that job creation has been fewer under Republican control is not supported by the data.

Answer: 0"
365,"Explanation: According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the number of violent crimes in the United States has been decreasing since 2014. In 2020, the FBI reported a 2.5% decrease in violent crimes compared to the previous year. This trend is consistent with data from other sources, such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which also shows a decline in violent crime rates over the past decade.

Answer: 1"
366,"Explanation: According to the World Bank, Israel's per capita income (GDP per capita) is indeed one of the highest in the world. As of 2021, Israel's per capita income was approximately $40,000, which is higher than many countries. However, it is not accurate to say that Israel's per capita income is greater than three-fourths of the rest of the world. The World Bank's data shows that Israel's per capita income is higher than many countries, but not all. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
367,"Explanation: The claim is based on a report from the Georgia Governor's Office of Highway Safety, which stated that Georgia is on track for 1,200 traffic fatalities in 2021, a reversal of the nine-year decline in traffic fatalities. This information is accurate and has been reported by reputable sources.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0"
369,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama served on a board with former Weather Underground member William Ayers and that this relationship continued after 9/11 is true.

The relationship between them was publicly known and discussed during Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Answer: 1"
370,"Explanation: President Barack Obama did indeed promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill during his first year in office. However, the bill was not passed during his first year. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2009 was introduced in the Senate in May 2009, but it did not pass. Therefore, the claim that Obama broke his promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill in his first year is false.

Answer: 0"
371,"Explanation: The claim is false. The statement that ""we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle class and small businesses"" is misleading. In 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which included several tax provisions, but it is not accurate to say that 25 tax cuts were passed. Additionally, the claim does not specify which tax cuts were aimed at the middle class and small businesses, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of that part of the statement.

Answer: 0"
372,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Iran Nuclear Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The deal does not specify that Iran would be on the side of any country, including Israel, in the event of an attack. The JCPOA is a non-proliferation agreement and does not involve military alliances or commitments.

Answer: 0"
373,"Explanation: The claim that Texas added more jobs in 2010 than any other state is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, California added more jobs in 2010 than any other state. Texas did have a significant increase in jobs, but it was not the highest.

374,"Explanation: The claim is false.

Answer: 0"
375,"Explanation: The claim is false. Brendan Doherty is a former White House Chief of Staff and is not currently a member of Congress or a political figure with the authority to propose or implement changes to Social Security benefits. Additionally, the claim that he wants to raise the eligibility age for Social Security benefits for anyone born after 1960 is not supported by any credible sources or official statements from him.

Answer: 0"
376,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt is as low as it has been since World War II is false. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt has been consistently increasing and is currently at its highest level since World War II. The debt has been growing due to factors such as increased government spending and lower tax revenues.

Answer: 0"
377,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Newport Tent company requires a different set of permits for each city or town they work in. This claim is likely false because most businesses, including those that set up tents, typically need similar types of permits (such as a business license, zoning permits, and health department approval) regardless of the location. The specific requirements might vary slightly, but the general process is usually consistent across different jurisdictions.

Answer: 0"
378,"Explanation: The claim states that Debbie Jackow will not de-fund the 20/20 land program. However, without specific information about Debbie Jackow's stance on this issue, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Political candidates often make promises during campaigns, but their actual policies and actions once in office can differ. Therefore, this claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
379,"Explanation: The claim is true. Since 1912, six justices have been confirmed during presidential election years. These justices are: William O. Douglas (1939), Earl Warren (1954), Potter Stewart (1971), Antonin Scalia (1986), Clarence Thomas (1991), and Samuel Alito (2006).

Answer: 1"
380,"Explanation: The claim states that property taxes are now 18% higher than when Mark Sharpe first took office. To verify this claim, we would need specific data on property tax rates at the time Mark Sharpe took office and the current property tax rates. Without this data, it is impossible to accurately assess the truth of the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false because it lacks specific data to support the 18% increase in property taxes.)"
381,"Explanation: The claim that the minimum number of infrastructure needs in Atlanta is $900 million is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific source or context given to support this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of this statement without additional information.

Answer: 0"
382,"Explanation: The claim is false. There have been several vacancies in the U.S. Supreme Court that lasted longer than 237 days in the past 30 years.

Answer: 0"
383,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general perception rather than specific data. While there are polls and surveys that suggest a majority of Americans support background checks for gun sales, the exact figure of ""ninety percent"" is not supported by any reliable source. According to a 2021 Gallup poll, 63% of Americans support background checks for all gun sales, which is a significant majority but not 90%.

Answer: 0"
384,"Explanation: The claim that a bill halting the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases would help stop rising gas prices is false. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates greenhouse gases primarily to address climate change, not to directly control gas prices. Gas prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and domestic production and consumption. Halting the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations would not directly address these factors and thus would not help stop rising gas prices.

Answer: 0"
385,"Explanation: The claim that the measles vaccine has killed 108 people in the last decade while no one has died of measles is false. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the measles vaccine has a very low risk of serious adverse reactions, and the vast majority of deaths from measles are due to the disease itself, not the vaccine. The claim also misrepresents the actual number of measles-related deaths, which are significantly higher than the number of vaccine-related deaths.

Answer: 0"
386,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the Virginia Department of Transportation, the state has indeed had a surplus in its transportation funds, but the amount and the spending on roads are not as stated in the claim. The surplus is not a billion dollars, and the spending on roads is not less than 1 percent of that surplus. The claim exaggerates the surplus and understates the spending on roads.

Answer: 0"
387,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt added up to $75 trillion in 2010 and is on track to hit $99 trillion this year is false. As of 2021, the U.S. national debt is approximately $28 trillion, not $75 trillion. The claim seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the debt's growth over time. The debt has indeed increased significantly, but the figures provided are incorrect.

Answer: 0"
388,"Explanation: The claim that the majority of the Hispanic population and the growth of the population is U.S.-born is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2019, about 62% of the Hispanic population in the U.S. was foreign-born. While the Hispanic population is growing, the majority of this growth is due to immigration from other countries, not births within the U.S. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
389,"Explanation: The claim ""No Bridge to Nowhere could occur"" is false. The term ""Bridge to Nowhere"" is a political term used to describe a project that is not needed or is wasteful. It is often used to criticize government spending on projects that do not provide any benefit. Therefore, it is possible for a ""Bridge to Nowhere"" to occur, as it is a real phenomenon in political and economic discourse.

Answer: 0"
390,"Explanation: The claim states that Joe Kyrillos voted against women's healthcare six times. To verify this, I would need to check the voting records of Joe Kyrillos on bills related to women's healthcare. However, without specific details or a source for these votes, it is not possible to confirm the claim's accuracy. Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
391,"Explanation: The claim that food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama is false. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is the program commonly referred to as food stamps, did increase under Obama, but the increase was not two-and-a-half times. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average monthly benefit per person increased from $125.30 in 2008 to $135.00 in 2016, which is an increase of about 8%. This is not a two-and-a-half times increase.

Answer: 0"
392,"Explanation: The claim is true. 38 Studios, a video game company, raised $25 million from Wall Street investors in 2010. However, the company went bankrupt in 2012, leading to the loss of the investors' money. The Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, which had guaranteed the loans, also faced financial difficulties as a result.

Answer: 1"
393,"Explanation: President Barack Obama did not make a specific promise to keep a Wisconsin GM plant from closing. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of his administration's efforts to save the auto industry during the 2008 financial crisis. The Obama administration provided loans to GM and Chrysler to help them restructure and avoid bankruptcy, but the specific plant closures were decisions made by the companies themselves, not a result of a broken promise by the president.

Answer: 0"
394,"Explanation: The claim that most or all of global warming is due to natural causes is not supported by the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has concluded that it is extremely likely (95% confidence) that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. Natural factors, such as volcanic activity and solar radiation, contribute to climate variability, but they are not sufficient to explain the observed warming trend. Therefore, the claim that the science is in dispute is misleading, as the scientific consensus is clear and well-documented.

Answer: 0"
395,"Explanation: The claim is true. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz USA announced that it would move its corporate headquarters from New Jersey to Atlanta, Georgia. The decision was influenced by factors such as Georgia's lower corporate tax rate and business-friendly environment compared to New Jersey. This information is well-documented in various news reports and official statements from Mercedes-Benz.

Answer: 1"
396,"Explanation: The claim that State Department officials directed contracts for the Haitian recovery after the earthquake to friends of the Clintons is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. The U.S. government's response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake was led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other federal agencies, not the State Department. Additionally, there is no evidence that any contracts were awarded to friends of the Clintons.

Answer: 0"
397,"Explanation: The claim that beer drinking is not allowed in any Illinois state parks is false. Illinois state parks do allow alcohol consumption, but there are certain restrictions and regulations in place. For example, alcohol consumption is generally allowed in designated areas, such as campgrounds and picnic areas, but it is not permitted in swimming areas or on hiking trails. Additionally, individuals must be of legal drinking age and must follow all park rules and regulations.

Answer: 0"
398,"Explanation: The claim that Tommy Thompson ran Medicare into the ground and brought it nine years closer to bankruptcy is a misrepresentation of his tenure as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. Medicare's financial status is influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in healthcare costs, demographic shifts, and policy decisions. While Thompson's tenure saw some changes in Medicare policy, there is no evidence to support the claim that he directly caused Medicare to be nine years closer to bankruptcy. The claim is misleading and not supported by factual evidence.

Answer: 0"
399,"Explanation: The claim that ""On new dollar coins, In God We Trust is gone!"" is false. The phrase ""In God We Trust"" has been a part of U.S. currency since 1956 and remains on all U.S. coins and paper money, including the new dollar coins. The design of the coins may have changed, but the inscription ""In God We Trust"" is still present.

Answer: 0"
400,"Explanation: The claim that the Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia is false. The Georgia Dome was a sports and entertainment venue in Atlanta, Georgia, which was demolished in 2016. The economic impact of the Georgia Dome was primarily related to its use as a venue for events such as the Super Bowl, the NCAA Final Four, and other major events. However, the claim of a $10 billion economic impact is not supported by credible sources or studies. The actual economic impact of the Georgia Dome was likely much lower.

Answer: 0"
401,"Explanation: The claim is based on a common misconception about progressive taxation. In reality, Warren Buffett and other wealthy individuals typically pay a lower effective tax rate than their secretary due to the progressive nature of the tax system. This means that higher-income individuals pay a higher marginal tax rate, but they also benefit from various deductions, credits, and other tax advantages that lower their overall tax burden. The claim suggests that this is unfair, but it is a fundamental aspect of how the tax system is designed to redistribute wealth.

Answer: 0"
402,"Explanation: The ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was a United States military policy that prohibited open discussion of sexual orientation in the military. This policy was officially ended in 2011 by the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama. However, the claim does not specify which Western countries have ended their ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policies, and it is not accurate to assume that all Western countries have done so. Therefore, the claim is not specific enough to be considered true.

Answer: 0"
403,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. federal debt has been increasing, but the relationship between debt and economic growth is complex and cannot be simplified to a direct ratio. The claim suggests a specific ratio ($2.52 borrowed for every $1 of economic growth), which is not accurate. Economic growth and debt are influenced by various factors, including fiscal policy, economic conditions, and monetary policy.

Answer: 0"
404,"Explanation: The claim about the Northwest Corridor highway project in Cobb and Cherokee counties creating over 9,700 jobs statewide is based on a study conducted by the Georgia Department of Transportation.

405,"Explanation: Hillary Clinton has not proposed destroying Medicare for seniors. In fact, she has consistently advocated for strengthening and improving Medicare. Her proposals have included expanding Medicare to cover more people and improving benefits for existing beneficiaries. The claim that she is proposing to destroy Medicare is a misrepresentation of her actual policy positions.

Answer: 0"
406,"Explanation: The claim is false. Superdelegates are not bound to vote for the winner of the Democratic primary in their state. They are free to vote for any candidate they choose, regardless of the primary results. This is a common misconception about the role of superdelegates in the Democratic Party's nomination process.

Answer: 0"
407,"Explanation: The Keystone XL Pipeline is a proposed oil pipeline that would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States. The term ""earmark"" typically refers to a provision in a bill that directs funds to a specific project or purpose. However, the Keystone XL Pipeline is not an earmark under House rules. The pipeline's approval process involves environmental impact assessments and regulatory reviews, rather than being funded through an earmark.

Answer: 0"
408,"Explanation: The claim that Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare is false. While Florida has implemented drug testing for welfare recipients, it is not the first state to do so. Other states such as Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee have also implemented similar policies. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
409,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they are paying now is false. There is no evidence or credible source supporting this claim. Hillary Clinton's tax proposals during her 2016 presidential campaign did not target African-American owned businesses specifically and did not propose a 50 percent increase in taxes.

Answer: 0"
410,"Explanation: The claim that ""a lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they're gay"" is a misconception. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that prison environments cause individuals to change their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is a complex trait influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and personal experiences, but it is not determined by prison environments. The claim is likely a myth or misinterpretation of the experiences of some individuals who may have come out as LGBTQ+ while in prison, but this does not mean that prison causes this change.

Answer: 0"
411,"Explanation: The claim is false. Darryl Glenn, a U.S. Senate candidate from Colorado, has not proposed eliminating the Department of Education or jeopardizing college funding for 320,000 Coloradans. Glenn has stated that he wants to reduce federal control over education and increase local control, but he has not proposed eliminating the Department of Education or putting 320,000 Coloradans' college funding at risk.

Answer: 0"
412,"Explanation: The claim that the president of the United States will be taking a trip to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day is highly unlikely to be true. Presidential trips abroad are typically planned and budgeted for by the Secret Service and other government agencies, and the costs are usually much lower than the figure stated in the claim. Additionally, the claim does not provide any credible source or context to support the $200 million per day figure.

Answer: 0"
413,"Explanation: The claim that white people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth is a generalization that oversimplifies the complex issue of wealth distribution. While it is true that certain groups may have disproportionate wealth, the claim of 90 percent is an exaggeration. According to various studies and reports, the wealth distribution varies significantly by country and region. For instance, in the United States, the top 10 percent of wealth holders control about 70 percent of the wealth, but this is not exclusive to white people. The claim also does not account for the diversity within the white population, including those who are not wealthy.

Answer: 0"
414,"Explanation: The claim that 200 consumer laws were destroyed in 2011 when Gov. Scott Walker signed Act 92 is false. Act 92, also known as the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, was a controversial piece of legislation that primarily dealt with collective bargaining rights for public employees. It did not significantly impact consumer laws. The claim of 200 consumer laws being destroyed is a misrepresentation of the actual effects of the legislation.

Answer: 0"
415,"Explanation: The claim states that Oregon ranked 25th or 7th from the bottom in percentage of children with untreated decay compared to 32 other states with similar data in 2007. To verify this claim, I would need to check reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Oregon Health Authority, or other reputable health organizations that provide data on oral health in children. Without specific data or a reliable source to back up the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
416,"Explanation: The claim that Ted Kennedy sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and it contradicts historical records and the known actions of Ted Kennedy during the Cold War era. Ted Kennedy was a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and was known for his opposition to Reagan's policies, but there is no record of him sending such a letter.

Answer: 0"
417,"Explanation: The claim that Muslims attempted to establish the first Islamic Sharia court inside the United States in the town of Irving, Texas, is false. While there have been discussions and attempts to establish Sharia courts in the United States, the claim that this was the first and specifically in Irving, Texas, is not accurate. There have been other attempts and discussions about Sharia courts in various locations across the country, but no such court has been officially established.

Answer: 0"
418,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rep. Pete Hoekstra is a former U.S. Representative from Michigan, and he served in Congress from 1999 to 2011. He is not currently a member of Congress. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that he tweeted the whereabouts of a top-secret mission to Iraq last year.

Answer: 0"
419,"Explanation: The claim about the Cuba embargo is true. The United States has maintained an economic embargo on Cuba since 1960, which has been a source of ongoing debate and controversy. The embargo, also known as the blockade, is a set of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on Cuba, restricting trade and investment between the two countries.

Answer: 1"
420,"Explanation: The claim is false. Scott Walker, the former Governor of Wisconsin, did not reject legislation to make college loan payments tax deductible. In fact, he signed a bill into law in 2015 that allowed for tax deductions on student loan interest. The claim that this resulted in raising taxes on students is also incorrect, as the bill was intended to provide tax relief to students.

Answer: 0"
421,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) did conduct a survey in 2014, but the results regarding Right-To-Work legislation were not as stated. The survey found that 51% of business executives were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation, not 15%.

Answer: 0"
422,"Explanation: The claim that ""almost all"" protesters in Madison are from outside of Wisconsin is an overgeneralization and lacks specific evidence to support it. While it is true that some protesters may be from outside Wisconsin, it is not accurate to say that ""almost all"" are. The composition of protesters can vary greatly depending on the specific event and the location within Wisconsin. Therefore, the claim is not supported by reliable evidence.

Answer: 0"
423,"Explanation: The claim states that Grady Yarbrough, a Democratic runoff opponent, previously ran statewide as a Republican. This claim is false because Grady Yarbrough is a Democrat and has not run as a Republican in any previous statewide elections.

Answer: 0"
424,"Explanation: The claim is false. The debt ceiling deal in 2011, known as the Budget Control Act, did not only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade. The deal included a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases, but it did not specifically allocate funds to extend the tax cuts. The tax cuts were extended as part of a separate agreement in 2012.

Answer: 0"
425,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). According to the NCES, in the 2018-2019 school year, rural schools enrolled about 20% of American children, not 40%. However, they did receive about 22% of federal education funding. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
426,"Explanation: The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, established the direct election of U.S. senators by popular vote. It replaced the previous system where senators were elected by state legislatures. Therefore, the claim that ""On repealing the 17th Amendment"" is false because the 17th Amendment has already been ratified and is part of the U.S. Constitution.

Answer: 0"
427,"Explanation: The claim is false. The actual number of jobs created during Bill Clinton's two terms (1993-2001) was approximately 22.5 million, while during George W. Bush's two terms (2001-2009), the number was approximately 11.5 million. The claim incorrectly states that only 3 million jobs were created during Bush's term.

Answer: 0"
428,"Explanation: A government shutdown can indeed disrupt veterans benefits. During a shutdown, many government services, including those provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), may be affected. This can lead to delays or disruptions in benefits such as disability compensation, pension payments, and healthcare services. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
429,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides subsidies for health insurance based on income and family size. However, the subsidy phase-out begins at a certain income level, which is $88,000 for a family of four in 2021. This means that a family of four earning $88,000 or less would qualify for a subsidy, but those earning more would not. Therefore, the claim that a family of four can make up to $88,000 a year and still get a subsidy is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
430,"Explanation: The claim that state workers have not had across-the-board raises in six years is not verifiable without specific data or sources. The statement is vague and does not provide enough context or evidence to confirm its accuracy. It is possible that some state workers may have received raises, while others may not, depending on various factors such as their position, department, and specific policies.

Answer: 0"
431,"Explanation: The claim that students in college used to take a popcorn popper and fry squirrel is highly unlikely. Popcorn poppers are not designed for frying squirrels, and it is not a common practice to cook squirrels in such a manner. Additionally, squirrels are not typically considered a food source in many cultures, and their preparation would require specific knowledge and tools that are not typically associated with a popcorn popper.

Answer: 0"
432,"Explanation: Ronald Reagan, during his presidency, did raise taxes on several occasions. In 1982, he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which included a tax increase. In 1984, he signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, which also included a tax increase. In 1985 and 1986, he signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which included significant tax increases. In 1987, he signed the Tax Act of 1987, which included a tax increase. Therefore, the claim that Ronald Reagan raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987 is true.

Answer: 1"
433,"Explanation: The claim that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has stated that supporting the right to health care means you believe in slavery is a misrepresentation of his actual views. Sen. Paul has been a vocal opponent of government-mandated health care, but he has not equated support for health care with support for slavery. The claim is a distortion of his position and is intended to mislead or misrepresent his views.

Answer: 0"
434,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums for pre-existing conditions, including pregnancy. Pregnant women can purchase health insurance on their own and are not barred from maternity coverage due to a pre-existing condition. The ACA also requires that maternity coverage be included in all health plans sold to individuals and small businesses.

Answer: 0"
435,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the cost of commuting to New York City via the Port Authority with the income tax paid to the state of New Jersey. The cost of commuting can vary greatly depending on the specific route, time of day, and frequency of travel. Additionally, income tax rates and deductions can also vary significantly. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that commuting costs are always higher than income tax paid. The claim is not supported by specific data or a general rule that applies to all individuals earning under $100,000 a year.

Answer: 0"
436,"Explanation: The claim that there are 850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry is not accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2021, the total employment in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in Ohio was around 100,000 jobs. This discrepancy suggests that the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
437,"Explanation: The claim is false. Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018. During his tenure, the Republican Party did not gain control of either the New Jersey Senate or the New Jersey General Assembly. However, the claim that he is the only governor since World War II to fail in this regard is incorrect. For example, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, a Democrat, also failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body during his term.

Answer: 0"
438,"Explanation: The claim that ""Sixty-percent of the state retirees...dont get Social Security"" is false. According to the Social Security Administration, all retirees who have earned enough credits (40 quarters) are eligible for Social Security benefits. The claim suggests that a significant portion of state retirees are not eligible, which contradicts the established rules and requirements for Social Security benefits.

Answer: 0"
439,"Explanation: The claim states that crime is down across the board and specifically mentions a 10 percent decrease in the most serious crimes. This claim is based on a general statement about crime rates and a specific percentage decrease. To verify this claim, one would need to look at official crime statistics from a reliable source such as the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program or similar data from other law enforcement agencies. Without specific data or a citation of the source, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
440,"Explanation: The claim that Tampa mayoral opponent Bob Buckhorn supported forcing police officers to keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers is false. There is no evidence or record of Buckhorn advocating for such a policy. This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fabrication of his actual stance on police policies.

Answer: 0"
441,"Explanation: The claim that millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool under the new health care law is a misinterpretation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, also known as Obamacare, was designed to expand access to health insurance, not to force people into a government-run system. The law provides subsidies to help people afford private health insurance plans, and it also expanded Medicaid eligibility. The claim is false because it mischaracterizes the ACA's provisions and intent.

Answer: 0"
442,"Explanation: The claim is false. Police departments do not typically run advertisements that directly target drug dealers or offer to ""take their competition off the streets for FREE."" Such a statement would be unethical, illegal, and against the principles of law enforcement. Police departments focus on enforcing laws and apprehending criminals, not on advertising services to criminal elements.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
444,"Explanation: The claim is false. State laws regarding property appraisal and payment can vary, but generally, the appraisal process is used to determine the market value of the property, and the payment amount can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, negotiations, and the specific terms of the sale or transaction. The claim that the state can only pay a certain amount above the appraisal is not accurate as it oversimplifies the process and ignores the flexibility in property transactions.

Answer: 0"
445,"Explanation: Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, and rash. However, it is not one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide. The most common causes of child blindness are vitamin A deficiency, refractive errors, and cataracts.

Sarah Palin, as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009, implemented a policy known as the Alaska Permanent Fund, which uses a portion of the state's oil and gas revenues to provide an annual dividend to Alaska residents. This policy was indeed a significant part of her administration's efforts to share the state's wealth with its citizens.

Answer: 1"
447,"Explanation: The claim that Portland Community College serves more students than all of the states universities combined is false.

Answer: 0"
448,"Explanation: The claim that Saddam Hussein wanted to acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ""said so himself after his capture"" is false. While it is true that Saddam Hussein had a history of pursuing WMD programs, there is no evidence that he explicitly admitted to this during his capture or trial. The claim is a misinterpretation of the available information.

Answer: 0"
449,"Explanation: The claim ""On disaster aid offsets"" is incomplete and lacks context.

Answer: N/A"
450,"Explanation: Sarah Palin served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009, and Barack Obama served as the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. While both have held significant political positions, the claim that Sarah Palin has more experience than Barack Obama is false because Barack Obama's experience as President of the United States is more extensive and significant than Sarah Palin's experience as Governor of Alaska.

Answer: 0"
451,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the cost of renting a U-Haul to move from San Francisco to Austin is twice as much as the cost to move from Austin to San Francisco due to a lack of trucks to flee the Golden State. This claim is false because the cost of renting a truck for a move is typically determined by factors such as distance, time of year, and demand, not by the direction of the move. The cost of renting a truck from San Francisco to Austin would be the same as from Austin to San Francisco, assuming the same truck size and rental period.

Answer: 0"
452,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not doubled its estimate for the cost of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The CBO's initial estimate for the cost of the ACA was $1.1 trillion over 10 years, not $800 billion. The CBO has revised its estimates over time, but the most recent estimates are still in the range of $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion over 10 years, not $1.7 trillion.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 1"
454,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Department of Energy's Billion Ton Study, published in 2010, actually found that wind and solar energy could provide a significant portion of the U.S. energy needs. The study estimated that wind and solar energy could provide up to 20% of the U.S. energy needs by 2030, not 5%. The study also noted that these renewable energy sources could be cost-competitive with conventional energy sources by that time.

Answer: 0"
455,"Explanation: The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly provide for just compensation when land is taken under eminent domain. Instead, the Fifth Amendment states that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. This means that the government must provide fair compensation to the owner when it takes their property for a public purpose. However, the specific amount of compensation is determined by the courts and can vary based on the circumstances.

Answer: 0"
456,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the spending on negative ads by Mitt Romney's campaign to the spending by John McCain's campaign during his entire presidential run. As of the time of this analysis, there is no publicly available data that directly supports this claim. Campaign spending data is typically reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and is not always immediately available. Therefore, without specific data from reliable sources, it is not possible to verify the claim.

Answer: 0"
457,"Explanation: The claim that some of the hijackers used New Jersey driver's licenses to board the aircraft on 9/11 is true. Investigations into the 9/11 attacks revealed that several of the hijackers had obtained New Jersey driver's licenses, which they used to board the planes. This information was part of the official investigation reports and has been widely reported in various media outlets.

Answer: 1"
458,"Explanation: The claim that for every $10,000 invested in business incubators, up to nearly 70 local jobs are generated, is not supported by reliable data or studies. While business incubators can indeed create jobs, the number of jobs created can vary greatly depending on various factors such as the industry, the specific incubator program, and the local economic conditions. There is no universally accepted figure that states for every $10,000 invested, nearly 70 jobs are generated.

Answer: 0"
459,"Explanation: The claim is partially true but misleading. While it is accurate that Presidents Harding, Kennedy, and Reagan cut taxes during recessions, the claim that they all produced ""rapid and dramatic economic recoveries"" is an oversimplification. The economic recoveries under these presidents varied in speed and magnitude. Additionally, the claim that Herbert Hoover and Barack Obama did ""the opposite"" is also misleading. Hoover did not cut taxes during the Great Depression, but his policies were not the primary cause of the economic downturn. Obama's stimulus package included tax cuts, but the claim that he did ""the opposite"" of the other presidents is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
460,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, which found that the income of the top 1 percent in the United States nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, while the income of the typical family (median income) barely increased. This study has been widely cited and is considered reliable. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"

463,"Explanation: The claim that financial conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the president and that the president does not have to have a blind trust is false. The U.S. Constitution and federal laws, such as the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, require the president to disclose their financial interests and may require them to place their assets in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest. This is to ensure that the president's decisions are not influenced by their personal financial interests.

468,"Explanation: The claim that the radiation from new TSA body scanners is equivalent to about three minutes worth of air travel at 30,000 feet is misleading. While it is true that the radiation dose from the TSA body scanners is low, comparing it to air travel at 30,000 feet is not accurate. The radiation dose from air travel at high altitudes is primarily due to cosmic radiation, which is different from the type of radiation used in TSA body scanners. The TSA body scanners use non-ionizing radiation, specifically millimeter waves, which are not the same as the ionizing radiation encountered at high altitudes. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
469,"Explanation: The claim that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she is raped is a misinterpretation of the concept of ""rape shield laws"" and the body's natural responses to trauma.

The claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
470,"Explanation: The claim that the new healthcare law crushes small businesses with billions in penalties is a simplification and an exaggeration. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does impose penalties on businesses that do not provide health insurance to their full-time employees, but these penalties are not applied to all small businesses. The penalties are only applied to businesses with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, the penalties are not billions but are calculated based on the number of full-time employees and the cost of providing health insurance. Furthermore, the ACA also provides tax credits to small businesses to help offset the cost of providing health insurance.

Answer: 0"
471,"Explanation: The claim states that despite having a president who was opposed to abortion, the number of abortions did not decrease.

Answer: 1"
472,"Explanation: The claim that ""every school will be negatively impacted if Education Stability Fund is not tapped"" is a generalization that may not hold true for all schools. The impact of not tapping the Education Stability Fund would depend on various factors, including the specific needs and financial situations of individual schools. Some schools might have other funding sources or reserves that could mitigate the impact, while others might be more severely affected. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every school will be negatively impacted.

Additionally, the term was used by other political figures and in various media outlets before your claim.

Answer: 0"
474,"Explanation: The claim that the United States sends a billion dollars to foreign countries every day due to its addiction to foreign oil is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate. While the U.S. does import a significant amount of oil, the total cost of these imports is not a billion dollars per day. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average daily cost of oil imports in 2021 was around $100 million, not a billion dollars. Additionally, the U.S. is also a major oil producer and exporter, which helps to balance the trade.

Answer: 0"
480,"Explanation: The claim that poor people do not abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group is not accurate. Numerous studies and reports have shown that individuals from lower-income backgrounds are more likely to engage in substance abuse, including drugs. This is often due to a combination of factors such as stress, lack of access to healthcare, and limited education. For instance, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has reported that lower-income individuals are more likely to use and abuse drugs due to the stress and hardships associated with poverty.

Answer: 0"
481,"Explanation: To evaluate the claim that Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth over the year, we need to consider data from reliable sources such as the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis or the U.S. Census Bureau. As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have specific data on personal income growth for Wisconsin compared to other Midwest states for the current year. However, typically, such rankings are based on annual reports and comparisons that are released periodically. Without specific data for the current year, it is not possible to definitively say whether Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth.

Answer: 0"
482,"Explanation: The claim that the Democrats' health care bills would provide ""free health care for illegal immigrants"" is false. While some Democratic proposals have included provisions to expand access to health care for undocumented immigrants, these bills do not provide ""free"" health care for all undocumented immigrants. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other Democratic health care bills typically provide access to health care services through public programs or private insurance, but undocumented immigrants are generally not eligible for these programs without additional legislation. The term ""free"" is misleading as it implies no cost, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
483,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the use of E-Verify, a system used to verify the employment eligibility of individuals, increases the likelihood of unfair job denials. However, E-Verify is designed to ensure that employers hire only authorized workers, and it does not inherently increase the chances of unfair denials.

492,"Explanation: The claim that ""millions of Americans are paying more and getting less under Obamacare"" is a simplification of a complex issue. While it is true that some people have experienced higher premiums and reduced coverage under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), this is not a universal experience. Many people have benefited from the law, including those who were previously uninsured, those who received subsidies to lower their premiums, and those who gained access to preventive care and essential health benefits. The claim also does not account for the overall impact of the law, which has led to a significant reduction in the uninsured rate and improved access to healthcare for many Americans.

Answer: 0"
493,"Explanation: When Barack Obama took office in 2009, the Democratic Party held 257 seats in the House of Representatives and 59 seats in the Senate, which was indeed a significant majority.

509,"Explanation: The claim is false. While pharmacies do have databases to manage prescription drugs, these databases are not designed to track and manage all prescription drugs across the entire healthcare system. A separate prescription drug database would be beneficial for tracking drug usage, identifying potential drug interactions, and monitoring the effectiveness of treatments on a larger scale. The current pharmacy databases are more focused on inventory management and patient-specific records rather than providing a comprehensive overview of prescription drug usage across the entire population.

Answer: 0"
510,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did not force people out of their health plans. However, it did require individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty, which led some people to drop their plans. Additionally, the ACA introduced new regulations and requirements for health insurance plans, which could have caused some people to switch to different plans or drop their coverage altogether. Therefore, while the ACA did not explicitly force people out of their health plans, it did create circumstances that led some people to change their coverage.

541,"Explanation: The claim that wind power is already cheaper than fossil fuels in Texas is generally true. According to various studies and reports, the cost of wind power has been decreasing and is now often competitive with or even cheaper than traditional fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. This is due to advancements in technology, economies of scale, and government incentives for renewable energy.

Answer: 1"
542,"Explanation: The claim suggests a correlation between a recent economic uptick and the expectation of a new Republican Congress. However, correlation does not imply causation. Economic trends are influenced by a multitude of factors, including global economic conditions, monetary policy, and domestic economic policies. The expectation of a new Republican Congress could be a factor, but it is not the sole determinant of economic trends. Therefore, the claim is not necessarily true.

Answer: 0"
543,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was a multilateral agreement signed in 2015 between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States), and the European Union. The agreement was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The claim that the person was one of the few who voted ""no"" on the Iran deal is not accurate because the deal was not voted on by the U.S. Congress; it was a multilateral agreement negotiated by the Obama administration.

Answer: 0"
544,"Explanation: The claim is referring to a specific individual named Kirk, but it does not provide any specific details or sources to support the claim that he violated Pentagon rules twice for improperly mingling politics with his military service. Without concrete evidence or specific details, it is not possible to verify the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
545,"Explanation: The claim that Oregon has never before tried to create a land-use plan for what it should look like for 50 years is false. Oregon has indeed implemented land-use planning, including long-term plans. The Oregon Land Use Act of 1973 established a system of land-use planning that includes comprehensive plans, which are designed to guide the development of the state over a 20-year period. While the specific 50-year timeframe mentioned in the claim is not accurate, the state has a history of creating and updating land-use plans.

Answer: 0"
546,"Explanation: The claim that ""On expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act"" is true. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes provisions to expand Medicaid eligibility to more low-income individuals and families. This expansion was intended to provide health insurance coverage to more people who might not otherwise have access to it.

Answer: 1"
547,"Explanation: The claim that doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries is a misinterpretation of a study conducted by the Institute of Medicine in 1999. The study found that medical errors, including those that result in death, occur in about 98,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States. This figure does not represent the number of deaths directly caused by botched surgeries but rather the total number of deaths due to medical errors. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and misleading.

Answer: 0"
548,"Explanation: The claim is false. The White House did not brand the memorial service for the Tucson shootings with a ""Together We Thrive"" logo and slogan. The event was held in 2011, and the official branding and themes used were related to the event's purpose and the victims, not a specific logo or slogan like ""Together We Thrive.""

Answer: 0"
549,"Explanation: The claim states that taxes will have been cut by $4.7 billion in the state by the end of the current budget. However, without specific details about the budget, the source of the claim, or any official documentation, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this statement. Tax cuts are typically announced and detailed in official budget documents, and such information would be necessary to confirm the claim.

Answer: 0"
550,"Explanation: The claim that President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote a letter of resignation to the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy is false. Eisenhower was not involved in the planning or execution of the Normandy landings, which were primarily the responsibility of General Bernard Montgomery and other Allied commanders. Additionally, Eisenhower did not resign after the landings; he continued to serve as the Supreme Allied Commander and later became the 34th President of the United States.

Answer: 0"
551,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama ""reversed"" on his commitment ""to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately"" is false. During his presidency, Obama did indeed announce a timeline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, but the timeline was not immediate. The withdrawal process began in 2009 and was completed in 2011, with the last U.S. troops leaving Iraq in December 2011. Therefore, the claim that he reversed his commitment to immediate withdrawal is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
552,"Explanation: The claim is based on a study conducted by the Center for Immigration Studies, which is a think tank known for its conservative views on immigration. The study, titled ""Criminal Alien Convictions in the United States, 2008-2014,"" found that criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, and New York during that period. However, it's important to note that the term ""criminal alien"" is often used to refer to undocumented immigrants, and the study's methodology and data sources have been criticized by some for not accurately representing the full picture of immigration-related crime. Additionally, the study's findings have been disputed by other researchers who argue that the data is misleading and that the percentage of criminal aliens is actually lower.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
553,"Explanation: The claim that repealing Obamacare saves our nation more than $2 trillion is false. The $2 trillion figure is often cited in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare's overall cost, but it does not represent savings from repealing the law. The repeal of Obamacare would likely result in increased costs for many Americans due to the loss of subsidies and protections for pre-existing conditions. The $2 trillion figure is more accurately associated with the total cost of the ACA over its lifetime, not with savings from repealing it.

Answer: 0"
554,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no constitutional amendment that bans drilling off Florida's coast. The U.S. Constitution does not have provisions that specifically address offshore drilling. Instead, the regulation of offshore drilling is governed by federal laws and regulations, such as the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The ban on drilling off Florida's coast is a result of executive orders and policies, not a constitutional amendment.

Answer: 0"
555,"Explanation: The claim is false. In President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, the words ""al-Qaida"" were indeed used. The claim that these words were never used in the address is incorrect. Additionally, the claim that this is the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001 is also false, as the words ""al-Qaida"" were used in previous State of the Union addresses.

Answer: 0"
556,"Explanation: John McCain, a Republican Senator from Arizona, was known for his conservative views on economic issues. He did vote against several minimum-wage increase bills during his time in the Senate. However, the claim that he voted 19 times against a minimum-wage increase is not accurate. According to records, he voted against a minimum-wage increase bill in 2007, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he voted against it 19 times.

Answer: 0"
557,"Explanation: The claim states that only four Texas legislators voted against a law giving in-state tuition rates to certain illegal immigrants. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that only four legislators voted against the law. In fact, the law in question, SB 175, was passed with a majority vote, and the number of legislators who voted against it was more than four. The specific details of the vote can be verified through official legislative records.

Answer: 0"
558,"Explanation: Oregon is indeed highly dependent on trade, with a significant portion of its economy driven by exports. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Oregon's exports accounted for 19.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, which is one of the highest percentages among U.S. states. This makes Oregon one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation.

Answer: 1"
559,"Explanation: The claim is based on a misunderstanding of federal tax revenue and spending. New Jersey and Kentucky, like all states, receive federal funds for various programs, but this does not mean they are getting back more than they send. The federal government collects taxes from all states and uses these funds to provide services and benefits to all Americans. The claim that New Jersey gets 61 cents back for every dollar sent to Washington and Kentucky gets $1.51 back is incorrect and misleading.

Answer: 0"
560,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everyone's jobs, including low-income African-Americans, is false. Hillary Clinton has not proposed such a policy. She has, however, supported comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but this does not involve instant work permits for millions of new immigrants. Additionally, the claim that this would take jobs from low-income African-Americans is a common misconception and not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
561,"Explanation: The claim that the United States spends $12,000 per child per year in the school system is not accurate. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average expenditure per student in the United States in 2019 was approximately $12,635. However, this figure includes all levels of education (elementary, secondary, and post-secondary) and is not specific to a single year. The claim also uses the term ""a kid,"" which is informal and not typically used in official or academic contexts.

Answer: 0"
562,"Explanation: The claim ""I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor"" is a statement that cannot be objectively verified without additional context. It could be a personal opinion or a statement made in a specific context. Without knowing the context or the speaker's identity, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of this claim.

Answer: 0"
563,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's statements about Muslims are used to recruit fighters by terrorist groups is a complex issue. While it is true that some extremist groups may use political rhetoric to recruit, it is not accurate to attribute all recruitment efforts to specific statements made by a particular individual. The recruitment strategies of terrorist groups are multifaceted and often involve a combination of ideological, religious, and social factors. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the assertion that Trump's statements are directly used for recruitment.

Answer: 0"
564,"Explanation: Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 U.S. presidential election. However, Christie was not the first governor to endorse Romney. Other governors, such as John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Perry of Texas, also endorsed Romney before Christie.

Answer: 0"
565,"Explanation: The claim about Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Bob Graham missing a significant percentage of their votes in 2004 and 2008 is false. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of voting records. In reality, these figures are often misrepresented or exaggerated. For instance, the claim that Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes in 2008 is incorrect. Similarly, the claims about Kerry and Graham are also inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
566,"Explanation: The claim that Texans eat more catfish than residents of all other states combined is false. While Texas does have a significant catfish industry and is one of the top producers of catfish in the United States, it is not accurate to say that Texans consume more catfish than residents of all other states combined. Catfish consumption varies widely across the country, and it is not accurate to attribute the majority of catfish consumption to Texas alone.

Answer: 0"
567,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other climate agencies have reported that 2014 was not the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded. In fact, 2015 and 2016 were both warmer than 2014 in terms of global temperature.

Answer: 0"
568,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has indeed expanded health coverage to millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. However, the claim that it has ""saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans"" is not supported by specific data or studies. While the ACA has undoubtedly improved access to healthcare, the exact number of lives saved due to the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions is not quantified in a way that can be attributed to the ACA alone.

Answer: 0"
569,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the New Jersey Department of Personnel, the number of state employees has been fluctuating over the years, but it has not decreased to the level it was when Christie Whitman left office in 2001. In fact, the number of state employees has generally increased since then.

Answer: 0"
570,"Explanation: The claim that the Senate Republican education plan is an unfunded mandate for local school districts is based on the idea that the plan requires school districts to implement certain policies or programs without providing sufficient funding to cover the costs. However, the actual funding provisions of the plan would need to be examined to determine if it is indeed an unfunded mandate. Without specific details about the funding mechanisms and the extent to which the plan requires local districts to cover costs, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false.

Answer: 0/1"
571,"Explanation: John McCain, a former U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate, has indeed made statements about the economy. However, the specific claim that he has said the economy is ""not his strong suit"" is not a widely recognized or verified statement. There is no substantial evidence or widely reported quote from McCain that directly supports this claim.

Answer: 0"
572,"Explanation: The claim that ""Every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories"" is not accurate. While it is true that the United States has been experiencing a decline in manufacturing jobs and closures of factories, the number of factories closing daily is not consistently 15. This claim is an exaggeration and not supported by reliable data.

Answer: 0"
573,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no evidence to support that the current agriculture commissioner allowed tainted beef to be sent to school cafeterias. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
574,"Explanation: The claim is false. Congressman John Lewis did not make allegations that Sarah Palin and Donald Trump were associated with the worst chapter in American history. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of Lewis' statements. Additionally, Senator Obama did not make any remarks about the association of Sarah Palin and Donald Trump with the worst chapter in American history.

Answer: 0"
575,"Explanation: The claim is false. The national debt is indeed a significant figure, but it is not accurate to say that it is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household. The national debt is approximately $28 trillion as of 2021, and the U.S. population is around 331 million. Dividing the debt by the population gives a figure of about $84,600 per person, not $48,700. Similarly, the U.S. has about 128 million households, so dividing the debt by the number of households gives a figure of about $218,000 per household, not $128,300. The claim also incorrectly states that the national debt is equivalent to the size of the entire economy. The U.S. economy is much larger than the national debt.

Answer: 0"
576,"Explanation: The claim that the House of Representatives voted to remove the word ""lunatic"" from federal law is false. The term ""lunatic"" is not used in federal law and has not been a subject of recent legislative action. The term is outdated and has been replaced by more accurate and respectful terminology in mental health contexts.

Answer: 0"
577,"Explanation: The claim that the state's budget shortfall is not that much different than it was in 2003 cannot be accurately evaluated without specific data or context. Budget shortfalls can vary significantly from year to year due to numerous factors such as economic conditions, tax revenues, and spending priorities. Without concrete figures or a comparison of the actual shortfalls for the respective years, it is impossible to determine the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
578,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific time period (2011-13) and a specific group (school districts). To verify the claim, one would need to look at data from that specific time period and group. Without access to such data, it's impossible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, if the claim is based on a reliable source and the data supports it, then the claim could be considered true.

Answer: 0/1 (0 if this claim is false or 1 if this claim is true)"
579,"Explanation: The claim is referring to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The ACA expanded healthcare coverage to millions of Americans, including many in Florida. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of 2021, about 11.4 million Americans in Florida were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) due to the ACA. However, the claim of ""thirty million Americans"" is an exaggeration. The actual number of Americans who gained coverage due to the ACA is around 20 million.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false)"
580,"Explanation: The claim that there is only one candidate under investigation, Terry McAuliffe, is false. There have been multiple candidates under investigation in various political and legal contexts. For example, in the United States, there have been investigations involving other candidates and politicians, such as Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and others.

Answer: 0"
581,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have specific information about the current composition of the Austin City Council. However, it is possible to verify this information by checking the official Austin City Council website or other reliable sources. Without such verification, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0"
582,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has not been focusing on the fact that 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of data related to traffic patterns or vehicle occupancy rates. TxDOT's focus is typically on infrastructure maintenance, traffic management, and safety, not on the specific occupancy rates of vehicles.

Answer: 0"
583,"Explanation: The claim that Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go when the restrictions of the Iran nuclear deal expire is false. The Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), includes strict monitoring and verification measures to ensure Iran's nuclear activities remain peaceful. Once the restrictions expire, Iran will still be subject to international inspections and monitoring to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. The claim overstates the immediate threat and ignores the ongoing oversight mechanisms.

Answer: 0"
584,"Explanation: The claim that sixty percent of auto thefts in St. Petersburg are caused by people leaving their keys in the car is not supported by reliable data or statistics. While it is true that leaving keys in the car can be a factor in thefts, it is unlikely that such a high percentage of thefts are attributed to this specific cause. The actual percentage of thefts due to keys left in the car would likely be much lower.

Answer: 0"
585,"Explanation: The claim is false. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) is a measure of the proportion of the population that is either employed or actively seeking employment. The LFPR has been declining since the 1990s, and it was at 67.3% when Barack Obama became president in 2009. As of 2021, the LFPR is around 61.7%. If the LFPR were to remain at the 2009 level, the unemployment rate would not necessarily be 11%. The unemployment rate is influenced by various factors, including the size of the labor force, the number of job openings, and the number of people actively seeking work. Therefore, the claim that the unemployment rate would be 11% if the LFPR were the same as when Obama became president is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
586,"Explanation: The claim that there was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010 is false. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), there was indeed a significant increase in the number of 501(c)(4) applications in 2010. This surge was largely attributed to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the subsequent political activity surrounding it.

Answer: 0"
587,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hurricane Katrina occurred in August 2005, and the U.S. Congress did pass a $60 billion relief package in September 2005. However, Superstorm Sandy occurred in October 2012, and the U.S. Congress did not pass a $60 billion relief package for Sandy. The claim is misleading by suggesting that no relief package was passed for Sandy, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
588,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Barack Obama's budget did not propose an Army with fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Army's size has fluctuated over time, but it is not accurate to say that Obama's budget proposed a reduction to the level of personnel before Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Army's size has been influenced by various factors, including the needs of the military and the political climate, but it is not accurate to make the claim as stated.

Answer: 0"
589,"Explanation: The claim states that the extra point is almost automatic and provides a specific statistic: ""The NFL had five missed extra points this year out of 1,200 some odd attempts."" This claim is false because it misrepresents the frequency of missed extra points. The NFL has a high success rate for extra points, and five missed attempts out of 1,200 is a very low number, indicating that extra points are indeed quite automatic.

Answer: 0"
590,"Explanation: The claim that ""under his tax plan, no matter where you are in the stratosphere, you're going to be getting a tax cut"" is a generalization that is not specific to any particular tax plan or individual. Tax plans can vary greatly depending on the specific provisions and the income levels they target. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say that everyone will receive a tax cut under any given tax plan without more specific information.

Answer: 0"
591,"Explanation: The claim is true. Texas has indeed been waiting for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to create insurance opportunities for the uninsured. In 2020, Texas submitted a waiver request to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to allow the state to create a reinsurance program to help lower premiums for individuals and small businesses. This proposal was part of a broader effort to address the state's high uninsured rate. As of my last update in October 2023, the federal government has not yet approved this proposal.

Answer: 1"
592,"Explanation: The claim that someone was endorsed by the Valley News newspaper cannot be verified without additional context or evidence. Endorsements by newspapers are typically publicized and can be verified through official sources or the newspaper's website. Without specific details or a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
593,"Explanation: The claim that John McCain voted against funding the troops because of a timeline in it to draw down American troops is false. John McCain was a strong supporter of the military and was known for his hawkish stance on foreign policy. He voted against the 2008 Defense Authorization Act because he believed it did not provide enough funding for the troops and did not address the issue of the troop surge in Iraq. He did not vote against funding the troops due to a timeline to draw down American troops.

Answer: 0"
594,"Explanation: The claim that there was a ""massive landslide victory"" in the Electoral College is false. The Electoral College is a process where each state's electoral votes are allocated based on the popular vote in that state. A ""landslide victory"" typically refers to a significant margin of victory in the popular vote, not the Electoral College. In the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, Joe Biden won the popular vote by a significant margin, but the Electoral College vote was much closer, with Biden winning 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 232.

Answer: 0"
595,"Explanation: The claim that a new bill was written into the new healthcare reform initiative ensuring that Congress will be 100 percent exempt is false. There is no such bill or provision that has been publicly disclosed or confirmed by credible sources. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and subsequent healthcare reform initiatives do not provide Congress with 100 percent exemption from the healthcare system. In fact, members of Congress are required to participate in the same healthcare system as the general public.

Answer: 0"
596,"Explanation: The claim that over 14,000 registered voters lost their vote in 2008 due to voting in the wrong precinct is false. While it is true that voting in the wrong precinct can result in a lost vote, the number of 14,000 is not accurate. The actual number of votes lost due to incorrect precinct voting in 2008 was much lower. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not based on accurate information.

Answer: 0"
597,"Explanation: The claim that the form students fill out to get college financial aid is ""longer than the form to get U.S. citizenship"" is false. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is used to apply for college financial aid, is typically shorter and simpler than the U.S. citizenship application form, which is known as the N-400 form. The N-400 form is significantly longer and more complex due to the detailed requirements for naturalization.

Answer: 0"
598,"Explanation: The claim is not verifiable with the information provided. It is a subjective statement that cannot be objectively proven or disproven without additional context or data. The claim does not specify the time period, the type of bills, or the definition of ""all the Democrats combined,"" making it impossible to accurately assess its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
599,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of the latest available data, Newt Gingrich has not raised as much money as Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee combined. According to the Federal Election Commission, as of the end of 2021, Newt Gingrich had raised $1.2 million, while the combined total for Romney, Pawlenty, Palin, and Huckabee was significantly higher.

Answer: 0"
600,"Explanation: The claim states that a person has bipartisan support, including 53 sheriffs throughout the state, from both Democrats and Republicans. However, without specific evidence or sources to verify this claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy. Bipartisan support from 53 sheriffs is a significant claim and would typically be backed by concrete evidence such as endorsements, statements, or official records. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified.

Answer: 0"
601,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, the uninsured rate in Texas was 17.9%, which is indeed higher than the national average of 8.9%. However, the claim that ""one in four Texans lacks health insurance"" is an exaggeration. The correct figure is approximately 17.9%, not 25%.

Answer: 0"
602,"Explanation: The claim ""On repeal and replace of federal health care reform"" is incomplete and lacks specific details. It does not provide enough information to determine its truthfulness. The term ""repeal and replace"" is often used in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but without specifying what is being repealed and replaced, it is impossible to evaluate the claim.

Answer: 0"
603,"Explanation: The claim that the real unemployment rate is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent is false. The official unemployment rate reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is 5.6% as of the latest data. The claim that the real unemployment rate is much higher is a common misconception, often based on misunderstandings of the official unemployment rate or the inclusion of discouraged workers and those who are underemployed. The BLS's official unemployment rate is calculated using a specific methodology that does not include all potential workers who are not in the labor force.

Answer: 0"
604,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no bill passed by House Republicans that makes it legal for single mothers to be fired by their employers. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or a false narrative.

Answer: 0"
605,"Explanation: The claim is false. Florida's voting law does not require voter registrations to be turned in within 48 hours. The deadline for voter registration in Florida is typically 29 days before an election, not 48 hours. This misinformation is likely an attempt to spread confusion or disinformation about the voting process.

Answer: 0"
606,"Explanation: The claim is false. Vaccines are designed to prevent deadly and crippling diseases. For example, vaccines for measles, polio, and COVID-19 have significantly reduced the incidence and severity of these diseases. The claim that there are a multitude of vaccines that do not prevent deadly and crippling diseases is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
607,"Explanation: The claim that China holds 26 percent of the U.S. debt is false. As of 2021, China holds approximately 10.9 percent of the U.S. debt, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's data. This percentage has been fluctuating over time, but it is not accurate to say that China holds 26 percent of the U.S. debt.

Answer: 0"
608,"Explanation: The claim that Portland has higher standards than federal guidelines on police use of force is not accurate. Federal guidelines, such as those established by the Department of Justice, provide a framework for police use of force that is generally considered to be the standard across the United States. Portland, like other cities, must adhere to these federal guidelines. While local policies may have additional or more stringent requirements, they do not supersede federal standards.

Answer: 0"
609,"Explanation: The claim that a National Football League (NFL) lockout would cost Atlanta $160 million in lost jobs and revenue is not verifiable with the information provided. The impact of a lockout on a specific city's economy, including job losses and revenue, would depend on various factors such as the city's dependence on the NFL, the number of jobs directly and indirectly related to the NFL, and the economic conditions of the city. Without specific data or a reliable source, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
610,"Explanation: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rates for different racial and ethnic groups can vary. As of the latest data, the unemployment rate for Latinos (Hispanic or Latino) is typically higher than the unemployment rate for whites, and the unemployment rate for blacks is often higher than that for Latinos. Therefore, the claim that the Latino unemployment rate is higher than the white rate and the black rate is higher than the Latino rate is true.

Answer: 1"
611,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama has spent over $2 million in legal fees defending lawsuits about his birth certificate is false. The lawsuits challenging Obama's birth certificate were largely dismissed or withdrawn, and the costs associated with these lawsuits were minimal. The claim is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
612,"Explanation: The claim that ""there's no rationing in any of these bills"" is false. Rationing is a common feature in many bills, especially those related to food, fuel, or other essential resources. The term ""rationing"" refers to the controlled distribution of goods or services to ensure fairness and prevent hoarding. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
613,"Explanation: The claim is false. There is no bill backed by Sean Duffy or other House Republicans that requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to conduct audits of rape victims who get an abortion. The claim is a misinterpretation of a bill that would require the IRS to audit tax returns of individuals who receive abortion services, but it does not specifically target rape victims.

614,"Explanation: The claim that Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor is a simplification of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While the ACA does introduce certain regulations and requirements for health insurance providers, it does not directly place the federal government between patients and their doctors. Instead, it aims to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health insurance and that insurance companies cannot deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The claim is misleading and oversimplifies the complex nature of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
615,"Explanation: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. The ACA has been widely studied and its impact on employment has been a subject of debate. Some studies suggest that the ACA may have led to a reduction in full-time employment, particularly among low-wage workers, due to the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees. However, these effects are not universally agreed upon and are often debated. The claim that the ACA will be the ""biggest job-killer ever"" is an exaggeration and not supported by the majority of evidence.

Answer: 0"
616,"Explanation: The claim that the cost to implement Florida's class size amendment has been ""$16 billion"" is false. The Florida class size amendment, which was passed in 2002, aimed to reduce class sizes in public schools. However, the total cost of implementing this amendment has been estimated to be around $1.5 billion, not $16 billion. This misinformation likely arises from confusion with the overall cost of education in Florida or other large-scale educational initiatives.

617,"Explanation: The claim that Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table of abandoning the dollar for a multinational currency is false. Timothy Geithner, who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from 2009 to 2013, never publicly proposed or discussed the idea of abandoning the U.S. dollar for a multinational currency. This claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of his views on international monetary policy.

Answer: 0"
618,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Martin Heinrich spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas is false. The CARES Act, which was passed in March 2020, included a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to help businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds were allocated to various programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, and direct payments to individuals. The claim that the funds were spent on failed companies and jobs overseas is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
619,"Explanation: The claim that FCAT (Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test) tests account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year is false. FCAT tests are a significant part of the instructional time in Florida schools, as they are used to assess students' performance in various subjects and are a requirement for graduation. The actual percentage of instructional time dedicated to FCAT tests is not less than 1 percent but is a significant portion of the school year.

Answer: 0"
620,"Explanation: The claim that Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning is false. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, included a provision that required indoor tanning services to be treated as a medical service, which led to an increase in the cost of tanning services. However, this was not a 10 percent tax on tanning but rather a requirement for tanning services to be treated as a medical service, which increased the cost of these services.

Answer: 0"
621,"Explanation: The claim that someone sued the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) seven times is not verifiable with the information provided. There is no specific mention of who made the claim or any details about the supposed lawsuits. Without concrete evidence or a reliable source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
622,"Explanation: The claim is false. President Obama did not own 60 percent of GM, nor did his union buddies own almost 20 percent. The U.S. government, through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), owned approximately 61% of GM's shares at its peak, but this was a temporary investment to stabilize the company during the financial crisis. The government sold its shares in GM in 2013, and the union's ownership was not a significant part of the GM's equity structure.

Answer: 0"
623,"Explanation: The claim states that there are 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts since lawmakers acted. However, there is no specific law or action mentioned that would directly lead to the creation of these businesses. Additionally, there is no credible source provided to verify this claim. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this statement.

Answer: 0"
624,"Explanation: The claim that gas prices have doubled because of Obama's policies is misleading and inaccurate. Gas prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and market speculation. The claim that Obama's policies directly caused gas prices to double is not supported by evidence. Additionally, the claim that Obama gave millions of tax dollars to Solyndra and blocked the Keystone pipeline is true, but these actions do not directly correlate to the doubling of gas prices. The Keystone pipeline was blocked due to environmental concerns, and Solyndra's bankruptcy was a result of market conditions and not a direct consequence of Obama's policies.

Answer: 0"
625,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, California's credit rating is not the worst in the country. California has a credit rating of AA- from Moody's, which is considered investment-grade. The state with the lowest credit rating in the U.S. is Illinois, which has a rating of BBB- from Moody's. Therefore, the claim that California has the worst credit rating in the country is false.

626,"Explanation: Lee Leffingwell served as the Mayor of Austin, Texas from 2009 to 2019, a total of 10 years. Sarah Palin served as the Governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009, a total of 3 years. Therefore, the claim that Lee Leffingwell has been mayor of Austin, Texas for about as long as Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska is false.

Answer: 0"
627,"Explanation: The claim is false. The unemployment rates in Ferguson, Missouri, are not directly attributable to President Barack Obama's policies. The unemployment rates in Ferguson are influenced by a variety of factors, including local economic conditions, industry-specific issues, and broader economic trends. Additionally, the claim does not provide specific data or sources to support the assertion that the black unemployment rate is three times higher than the white unemployment rate.

Answer: 0"
628,"Explanation: The claim is false. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) does not have the authority to prevent a company from building a factory in a state based on its labor laws. The NLRB's jurisdiction is limited to enforcing the National Labor Relations Act, which deals with labor relations and collective bargaining, not the specific labor laws of a state. South Carolina's right-to-work law does not prevent Boeing from building a factory there, as it is a matter of state law, not federal law.

Answer: 0"
629,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of deaths from gun violence in the United States to the number of deaths in the Afghanistan conflict. According to the Gun Violence Archive, as of 2021, there were approximately 24,000 deaths from gun violence in the United States. In contrast, the number of U.S. military and contractor deaths in Afghanistan, as of 2021, was around 2,400. Therefore, the claim that more people have died at the end of a gun in the U.S. since Newtown than we have lost in Afghanistan is false.

Answer: 0"
630,"Explanation: The claim that the Trump Winery near Charlottesville, Va. is the largest winery on the East Coast is false. The Trump Winery is a small, family-owned winery that produces a limited amount of wine. It is not the largest winery on the East Coast. The largest winery on the East Coast is the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Washington, which has a much larger production and more extensive vineyards.

Answer: 1 (assuming the claim is based on a reputable source)"
632,"Explanation: The claim is vague and lacks specific details about the ""first principles"" mentioned, the ""fellow,"" the ""truck,"" and the ""election night."" It also does not provide any evidence or context to support the claim. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
633,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the speaker put a luxury jet on eBay, which is highly unlikely. eBay is primarily used for selling consumer goods, not luxury jets.

Answer: 0"
634,"Explanation: The claim is about Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal, which is a political statement and not a fact that can be objectively verified as true or false. The truthfulness of such a claim depends on the specific details and context of the proposal, which are subject to interpretation and debate. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively judge the claim as true or false without additional context or specific details.

Answer: 0"
637,"Explanation: The claim that the national debt is on track to exceed the size of the entire economy in just two more years is an exaggeration. While the national debt is indeed growing, it is not expected to exceed the size of the economy in such a short period. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the national debt is projected to reach 102% of GDP by 2023, but this is not expected to happen in just two years. The claim is misleading and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
638,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the Powell Butte water reservoir was not necessary and that the money spent on its construction could have been saved. However, this claim is not supported by evidence or context. The decision to build the reservoir was likely based on a need for water supply, which is a critical infrastructure requirement. Without specific evidence or data to support the claim that the reservoir was unnecessary, it is not possible to verify its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
639,"Explanation: The claim that Dominic Chavez is a Rick Perry Republican lobbyist is false. Dominic Chavez is a Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Texas' 23rd congressional district. He is not associated with Rick Perry or the Republican Party. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a deliberate attempt to misrepresent Chavez's political affiliation.

Answer: 0"
640,"Explanation: The claim is referring to the concept of ""underemployment"" or ""hidden unemployment,"" which includes people who are struggling to find work, have stopped looking, or are working part-time but want full-time work. The official unemployment rate, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, is based on a specific methodology that does not include these groups. The BLS defines unemployment as ""the number of people who are jobless, actively seeking work, and available to take a job."" Therefore, the claim that the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent when considering all people struggling for work or have just stopped looking is not accurate based on the official definition and methodology.

Answer: 0"
641,"Explanation: The claim that a congressional laundry closed due to the partial government shutdown is false. The U.S. Capitol Visitor Center, which includes a laundry service, remained open during the partial government shutdown in 2018 and 2019. The shutdown did not affect the operation of the laundry service.

Answer: 0"
642,"Explanation: The claim that under City Council Member Randi Shade, Austin had the highest city debt per person in Texas is not verifiable with the information provided. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to compare Austin's city debt per person with other Texas cities during the relevant time period and verify if Randi Shade was indeed the City Council Member during that time. Without specific data and context, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
643,"Explanation: The claim states that gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration's projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy. However, without specific data or official sources to verify this claim, it is not possible to definitively confirm its accuracy. The term ""Sandy"" is not clear in this context, and it could refer to a specific event or period that might not be relevant to the fiscal year in question.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without additional information.)"
644,"Explanation: The claim is false. Amendment 4 in Florida, which was passed in 2018, does not have a local version that would specifically apply to St. Pete Beach. The amendment is a state-wide law that allows for the restoration of voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences and paid all fines and fees. There is no evidence to suggest that St. Pete Beach taxpayers have had to pay hundreds of thousands in legal bills due to a local version of Amendment 4.

Answer: 0"
645,"Explanation: The claim that the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders have entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
646,"Explanation: The Capitol rotunda was designed by Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Henry Latrobe in the early 19th century. Its primary purpose was to serve as a grand entrance and a central gathering space for the U.S. Congress. While it has been used for various events, including protests, its original design was not intended to specifically accommodate protests. The claim that the rotunda was made to invite the people in and to accommodate protests is a misinterpretation of its historical context.

Answer: 0"
647,"Explanation: The claim that over 214,000 doctors have opted out of Obamacare exchanges is false. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as of 2021, there were approximately 100,000 physicians participating in the exchanges. The number of physicians participating in the exchanges has been declining, but the claim of over 214,000 doctors opting out is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
648,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific incentive deal approved by a certain individual for Abbott Laboratories. However, without specific details or sources to verify the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy. The claim suggests that the deal included strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met, but this information is not substantiated by any reliable source.

Answer: 0"
649,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world is false. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. has a corporate tax rate of 21%, which is lower than many other countries. For example, France has a corporate tax rate of 25%, and Germany has a rate of 29.9%. Therefore, the U.S. does not have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.

Answer: 0"
650,"Explanation: The claim that ""a legacy of taxing and borrowing crippled the economy we inherited two years ago"" is subjective and depends on the specific context and definitions of ""crippled"" and ""two years ago."" Without specific data or context, it's difficult to definitively judge the claim as true or false. However, if we consider the general economic conditions and fiscal policies of the past two years, it's possible to infer that excessive taxing and borrowing could have had negative impacts on the economy.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be definitively judged as true without more specific context.)"
651,"Explanation: The claim is false. Charlie Crist, who served as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011, did not veto $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida. The claim is a misinterpretation of a budget cut that occurred during his tenure. Crist did not veto the entire budget request but rather made adjustments to the budget, which included cuts to various programs, including the teaching hospital.

Answer: 0"
652,"Explanation: The claim that Barack Obama has gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing George W. Bush is false. While it is true that Barack Obama criticized George W. Bush during his presidency, there is no evidence to suggest that he has plagiarized any of George W. Bush's policies or statements. The claim seems to be a mischaracterization or a misinterpretation of political rhetoric.

Answer: 0"
653,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump said ""all Mexicans are rapists"" is a misrepresentation of his actual statement. In a 2015 speech, Trump said, ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" This statement was widely criticized for its generalization and stereotyping. Therefore, the claim that he said ""all Mexicans are rapists"" is false.

Answer: 0"
654,"Explanation: The claim that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama in 2008 is false. While unions did contribute significantly to Obama's campaign, the total amount was not $400 million. According to reports, unions contributed around $100 million to Obama's campaign in 2008. This figure is significantly lower than the claimed $400 million.

Answer: 0"
655,"Explanation: The claim states that the 2007-09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion, which cost every man, woman, and child in the state an extra $310. To verify this claim, we need to check the accuracy of the tax hike amount and the per capita cost.

The claim does not provide a source or reference to support the $1.8 billion tax hike figure or the $310 per capita cost. Without a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of these numbers. Therefore, the claim cannot be independently verified as true or false.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without a reliable source.)"
656,"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, lying about your age on a dating website is not considered a misdemeanor.

The laws governing online behavior and misrepresentation vary by country and region, but in general, lying about your age on a dating website is not a criminal offense.

Answer: 0"
657,"Explanation: The claim states that the proposed raises for the Norcross City Council would put it in line with other similarly sized communities. To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the proposed raises with the compensation of city councils in other communities of similar size. If the proposed raises align with the average or median compensation of city councils in similar-sized communities, the claim is true. If not, the claim is false.

Answer: 1 (The claim is true if the proposed raises align with the compensation of city councils in other similarly sized communities.)"
658,"Explanation: The claim is true. While the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 was a significant nuclear incident, it did not result in any deaths. The accident led to the release of a small amount of radioactive iodine into the environment, but no one was killed as a result of the accident. The claim is accurate in stating that there have been no deaths caused by a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States.

Answer: 1"
659,"Explanation: The claim that Obama spent ""40 percent of the PAC money, 43 percent to be exact, on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians"" is false. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of data. The actual spending by Obama's campaign on these states was not 40% or 43% of his PAC money. The claim is likely a result of a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the data.

661,"Explanation: The claim that the climate has not warmed in quite a few years is false. Scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that the Earth's average temperature has been increasing over the past few decades. According to NASA's Global Climate Change Vital Signs, the global temperature has been rising since the late 1970s, with the last decade being the warmest on record. This trend is consistent with the long-term warming trend observed over the past century.

Answer: 0"
663,"Explanation: The claim that a North Carolina study proves that over a million people voted twice in the 2012 election is false. There is no credible evidence or study from North Carolina that supports this claim. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of a study that looked into voter fraud or irregularities, but not specifically the claim of over a million people voting twice.

Answer: 0"
664,"Explanation: The claim that Tarpon Springs takes its homeless to St. Petersburg is false. Tarpon Springs has its own homeless services and does not typically transport homeless individuals to St. Petersburg. The city of Tarpon Springs has its own homeless assistance programs and resources, and it is not accurate to say that it relocates homeless individuals to St. Petersburg.

Answer: 0"
665,"Explanation: The claim that ""illegal immigration is not actually getting worse"" is a generalization that can be misleading. While it's true that the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border has fluctuated over time, the overall trend has been an increase in illegal immigration attempts. For instance, the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border has been increasing since 2017, with a significant spike in 2021. Therefore, the claim that illegal immigration is not getting worse is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
666,"Explanation: The claim is comparing two different types of events: apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border and births in Texas. While it is true that a significant number of people are apprehended at the border each week, the number of births in Texas is also substantial. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the state has an average of about 10,000 births per week. The number of apprehensions at the border can vary, but it is typically in the tens of thousands per week. Therefore, the claim that more people are apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border a week than are born in Texas each week is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
667,"Explanation: The claim that there was a steady reduction in U.S. debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for more than 30 years after World War II is false. While it is true that the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio decreased in the 1950s and 1960s, it has been increasing since the 1970s and has been consistently above 100% since the 1980s. The debt-to-GDP ratio has fluctuated but has not shown a steady reduction over the long term.

669,"Explanation: The claim is false. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law in 1935, it was designed to provide benefits to a wide range of Americans, not just widows and orphans. It included provisions for old-age benefits, survivors' benefits, and disability benefits. Similarly, Medicare, which was established in 1965, was not a small program but a significant expansion of the Social Security system to provide health insurance for the elderly.

Answer: 0"
670,"Explanation: The claim is referring to the U.S. federal budget deficit, which is the difference between the government's spending and its revenue. In 2021, the U.S. federal budget deficit was indeed on track to top $1 trillion. This was due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's response to it, including the passage of the CARES Act and other stimulus packages. Therefore, the claim is true.

She appeared before the House Select Committee on Benghazi in 2015 and 2016, and also testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2016. Therefore, the claim that she refuses to testify is false.

Answer: 0"
672,"Explanation: The claim that Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson appears to endorse world government is a misinterpretation of his statements. In a 2010 interview, Bryson discussed the need for international cooperation and the potential benefits of a global economy, but he did not explicitly endorse a world government. His comments were more about the importance of international trade and cooperation rather than advocating for a single global government.

Answer: 0"
673,"Explanation: The claim that Rob Portman voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns is false. In 2015, Portman voted against a bill that would have allowed individuals on the terrorism watch list to purchase firearms. He has consistently supported measures to prevent individuals on the watch list from obtaining guns.

Answer: 0"
674,"Explanation: The claim that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was released by Obama in 2009 is false. Al-Baghdadi was captured by U.S. forces in Iraq in 2004 and was held in Camp Bucca prison. He was released in 2009, but this was due to a lack of evidence to keep him in custody, not because of any action by President Obama. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations.

Answer: 0"
675,"Explanation: The National Rifle Association (NRA) has historically opposed expanded background checks for gun purchases. The NRA has argued that such checks would infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens and would not prevent gun violence. Therefore, the claim that the NRA used to support expanded background checks is false.

Answer: 0"
676,"Explanation: The claim that you have gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party is false. The claim is made by Donald Trump, who has indeed won the Republican primaries in 2016 and 2020. However, the claim that he has gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party is not accurate. The most votes in a Republican primary were received by Mitt Romney in 2012, who won the Republican nomination but lost the general election to Barack Obama.

Answer: 0"
677,"Explanation: The claim that when the New Hampshire Legislature raised the gasoline tax, gas prices in the state were skyrocketing is not accurate. While it is true that the gasoline tax was raised, the claim that gas prices skyrocketed is an exaggeration. Gas prices in New Hampshire did increase, but the increase was not disproportionately higher than the increase in other states or the national average. The claim is misleading and does not accurately reflect the relationship between the tax increase and gas prices.

Answer: 0"
678,"Explanation: The claim that there has been bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives for the repeal of Obamacare, getting rid of cap and trade, and building the Keystone Pipeline is misleading. While there have been attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) with bipartisan support, the repeal efforts have not been successful. Additionally, there has been bipartisan support for the Keystone Pipeline, but the claim that there has been bipartisan support for getting rid of cap and trade is false. Cap and trade is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and it has bipartisan support in some forms, but the claim that there has been bipartisan support for getting rid of it is an oversimplification.

Answer: 0"
679,"Explanation: The claim is false. The U.S. government has not announced a plan to spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year. The U.S. has been reducing its military presence and aid in Afghanistan, not increasing it. Additionally, the claim that the U.S. is cutting the same things in its own country is not supported by any official statements or plans.

Answer: 0"
680,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the wrong precinct rules exacerbate provisional ballot problems and that HB 194 does nothing to solve this issue. However, without specific information about the content of HB 194 and the exact nature of the wrong precinct rules, it is difficult to definitively judge the claim. If HB 194 is intended to address the wrong precinct problem but fails to do so, then the claim would be true. If HB 194 does address the issue, then the claim would be false.

Answer: 0/1"
681,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower has been widely debunked. Multiple investigations and reports have found no evidence to support this claim. The Trump Organization has stated that all workers were legally employed and had proper documentation. Furthermore, the Trump Tower was built in the 1980s, and the immigration laws and practices were different at that time compared to today's standards.

Answer: 0"
682,"Explanation: Sharron Angle, a former U.S. Senator from Nevada, did propose to eliminate the Department of Education during her 2010 Senate campaign. She argued that education should be handled at the state and local levels, and that the federal government should have less involvement. However, this was a campaign promise and not a policy that was implemented during her time in office.

Answer: 1"
683,"Explanation: The claim that BP's $20 billion fund to compensate oil spill victims is a ""slush fund"" is false. A slush fund is typically used to describe a fund that is used for discretionary or non-transparent purposes. However, BP's $20 billion fund was established as part of a legal settlement to compensate victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The fund was set up to provide compensation to individuals and businesses affected by the spill, and it was overseen by a court-appointed administrator. Therefore, the fund was not intended for discretionary use and was not a slush fund.

Answer: 0"
684,"Explanation: The claim that ""on in-state tuition for illegal immigrants"" is generally false. In-state tuition is typically reserved for residents of a particular state, and many states have laws that prevent illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition rates. However, some states have policies that allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates, but this is not universal and varies by state. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
685,"Explanation: The claim states that ""the five economic indicators that the federal government tracks - for the first time since August 2006 - were positive this October."" This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that all five economic indicators were positive for the first time since August 2006. Economic indicators such as GDP, employment, and inflation have shown positive trends in recent months, but it is not accurate to say that all five indicators were positive for the first time since August 2006.

Answer: 0"
686,"Explanation: The claim is comparing annual deficits under Republican administrations with monthly deficits under Democratic administrations. This is a misleading comparison because annual deficits are typically reported on an annual basis, while monthly deficits are reported on a monthly basis. The claim suggests that the annual deficits under Republicans have somehow become monthly deficits under Democrats, which is not a valid comparison. The claim is false.

687,"Explanation: The claim states that a poll shows Democrats are just one point behind Gov. John Kasich without a name attached. However, the claim does not provide any specific details about the poll, such as the source, date, or methodology. Without this information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
688,"Explanation: The claim that we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country is not accurate. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but it is not twice as much as other countries. For example, in 2019, the U.S. spent $10,966 per capita, while countries like Germany and Japan spent around $5,000 per capita. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated.

Answer: 0"
689,"Explanation: The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1913, established the direct election of U.S. senators by popular vote. It replaced the previous system where senators were elected by state legislatures. Therefore, the claim that ""On repealing the 17th Amendment"" is false because the 17th Amendment has already been ratified and is part of the U.S. Constitution.

Answer: 0"
690,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the property taxes decreased due to a reduction in the technical college portion of the taxes, which was attributed to state funding. However, without specific details or evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Property tax rates can be influenced by various factors, including local budgets, state funding, and other political decisions. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0/1"
691,"Explanation: The claim that minors find it easier to get marijuana than alcohol is not universally supported by studies. While some studies may suggest that minors can more easily access marijuana, others indicate that access to alcohol is also a significant issue. The ease of access to these substances can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, local laws, and enforcement. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that minors find it ""very easy"" to get marijuana compared to alcohol.

Answer: 0"
692,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump is false. The Keystone XL pipeline was not a significant factor in determining gasoline prices. Gasoline prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including global oil supply and demand, refinery capacity, and geopolitical events. The Keystone XL pipeline was one of many proposed projects, and its cancellation did not directly impact gasoline prices at the pump.

694,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Perry pointed out that Social Security has been a failure is a misrepresentation of his actual stance. In reality, Gov. Perry has been a critic of Social Security's long-term sustainability and has proposed reforms to address its financial challenges. However, he has not outright stated that Social Security has been a failure. The claim is an exaggeration and a distortion of his actual views.

Answer: 0"
695,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has indeed reduced the number of uninsured Americans, but the reduction is not 3 percent for $2 trillion. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the uninsured rate in the U.S. decreased from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2019. The cost of the ACA is estimated to be around $1.2 trillion over 10 years, not $2 trillion.

Answer: 0"
696,"Explanation: The claim that we import more oil today than ever before is not accurate. While global oil consumption has been increasing, the peak of oil imports occurred in the 1970s due to the oil crisis. Since then, oil production and imports have fluctuated, but the overall trend has been a decrease in oil imports as a percentage of total oil consumption. This is due to increased domestic production and the development of alternative energy sources.

Answer: 0"
697,"Explanation: The claim that Will Hurd tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record is false. Will Hurd, a former Republican Congressman from Texas, was known for his moderate views and was often critical of his party's leadership. He voted with his party on most issues but was not as consistently conservative as the claim suggests. His voting record was more nuanced and varied, not strictly 96 percent Republican.

Answer: 0"
698,"Explanation: The claim that Greece is about the size of metropolitan Miami is incorrect. As of 2021, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Greece was approximately $243 billion, while the GDP of Miami-Dade County, which is the metropolitan area of Miami, was around $347 billion. Therefore, Greece is not comparable in size to Miami in terms of economic output.

Answer: 0"
699,"Explanation: The claim that ""forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children"" is a misinterpretation of the national debt. The national debt is the total amount of money the federal government has borrowed to finance its spending. It is not accurate to say that this debt is being borrowed from ""my children"" as it is a collective responsibility of the entire population. The debt is a result of the government's spending and is not directly borrowed from individuals.

Answer: 0"
700,"Explanation: Cigarette butts are indeed a significant source of litter and can pose a risk to children and pets if ingested. However, the claim that they specifically poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them is misleading. While nicotine is a harmful substance, the primary danger from cigarette butts is the ingestion of the toxic chemicals and tar present in the butts, not the nicotine itself. Additionally, the amount of nicotine in a single cigarette butt is not sufficient to cause poisoning in a child.

Answer: 0"
701,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by the Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, in a press release. The press release provides data from the Georgia Department of Labor, which shows that since Governor Kemp took office in January 2018, there have been 319,000 new private sector jobs created in Georgia, with nearly 93,000 of those coming in the past 12 months. The data is sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is considered reliable.

Answer: 1"
702,"Explanation: The claim that President Obama was proposing ""pinprick strikes"" for military intervention in Syria is false. The term ""pinprick strikes"" is not a recognized military strategy and was not used by President Obama or his administration. The U.S. military intervention in Syria, which began in 2014, involved airstrikes and other forms of military action, but not ""pinprick strikes.""

Answer: 0"
703,"Explanation: The claim that there are no political prisoners in Cuba is false.

These prisoners are often held without fair trials and subjected to harsh conditions.

Answer: 0"
704,"Explanation: The claim is about a change in a political figure's stance on a specific policy. Without specific context or a source, it's difficult to verify the exact nature of the change. However, if the claim is about a public figure's policy shift, it is generally true that politicians can change their positions over time. Therefore, the claim could be true depending on the specific context and the source of the information.

Answer: 1"
705,"Explanation: The claim is false. John Edwards, a former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate, was indeed a strong advocate for universal healthcare during his 2004 presidential campaign. He proposed a plan called ""Healthcare for All Americans,"" which aimed to provide universal healthcare coverage. Therefore, the statement that he wasn't for universal healthcare in 2004 is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
706,"Explanation: The claim states that Multnomah County libraries are open 44 hours per week, which is the lowest of any library in the four-county region. To verify this claim, I would need to check the actual operating hours of Multnomah County libraries and compare them with the operating hours of libraries in the other three counties in the region. Without specific data, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
707,"Explanation: Mike Huckabee has indeed appeared in infomercials promoting products and treatments for diabetes. However, it is important to note that these products and treatments are not endorsed by any major health agency. The claim is true because it accurately states that Huckabee has appeared in infomercials promoting diabetes treatments that are not supported by health agencies.

Answer: 1"
708,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not released any specific data or reports indicating that its regulation of greenhouse gases will endanger 575 Texas dairy facilities, 58 swine operations, 1,300 corn farms, and 28,000 beef cattle operations. The EPA's regulations on greenhouse gases are aimed at reducing emissions from various sources, including power plants, vehicles, and industrial facilities, but the specific numbers provided in the claim are not supported by any official EPA data or reports.

Answer: 0"
709,"Explanation: The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) is a proposed law that would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment. It does not target or discriminate against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, or the rights of religious freedom. In fact, ENDA is designed to protect individuals from discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, which are protected classes under the law. The claim that ENDA discriminates against religious groups is a misinterpretation of the law's purpose and intent.

Answer: 0"
710,"Explanation: The claim is false. John McCain, a Republican Senator, did not vote against the Bush tax cuts. In fact, he voted for the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. He later supported making them permanent, but he did not vote against them originally.

Answer: 0"
711,"Explanation: South Florida, particularly the Miami-Dade County area, is known for having a higher mosquito population compared to many other regions in the United States. This is due to the warm climate, abundant water sources, and the presence of invasive species like the Asian tiger mosquito. The Florida Department of Health and other local authorities often report higher mosquito activity in this region, which supports the claim.

Answer: 1"
712,"Explanation: The claim is false. While it is true that the City of Philadelphia and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, there is no evidence to support the claim that crime went down by 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years. The claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the actual impact of the investment.

Answer: 0"
713,"Explanation: The claim that Rhode Island has one of the 10 strictest gun laws among all the states is not accurate. According to the Gun Violence Archive and other sources, Rhode Island has relatively moderate gun laws compared to other states. While it does have some strict regulations, such as a requirement for a permit to purchase a firearm and a ban on certain types of assault weapons, it does not rank among the top 10 states with the strictest gun laws.

Answer: 0"
714,"Explanation: The claim that 2011 was the worst drought year ever recorded in the region is not accurate. While 2011 was a severe drought year, it is not accurate to say it was the worst ever recorded. Droughts are often measured by their severity, duration, and impact, and there have been other years with more severe droughts in the region. For example, the drought of 1934, known as the Dust Bowl, was one of the most severe droughts in U.S. history and had a significant impact on the region.

Answer: 0"
715,"Explanation: The claim that ""In the 1980s, the lowest income people had the biggest gains"" is false. During the 1980s, there was a significant increase in income inequality in the United States. While the overall economy grew, the gains were not evenly distributed. The top income earners saw substantial increases in their incomes, while the lowest income earners saw little to no increase. This period is often referred to as the ""Great Divergence"" due to the widening gap between the rich and the poor.

Answer: 0"
716,"Explanation: The claim that for every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps is a misinterpretation of data. The claim is based on a study by the Heritage Foundation, which suggested that for every job created by the stimulus package, 75 people were added to the food stamp rolls. However, this study was criticized for its methodology and the way it interpreted the data. The claim does not accurately reflect the relationship between job creation and food stamp usage during the Obama administration.

Answer: 0"
717,"Explanation: The claim is based on the assumption that solar energy can be efficiently collected and transmitted over long distances. While it is true that the Southwestern desert has high solar radiation, the claim does not account for several factors:
1. **Efficiency of Solar Panels**: Solar panels are not 100% efficient. They typically convert around 15-20% of the sunlight they receive into electricity.
2. **Transmission Losses**: Transmitting electricity over long distances results in significant losses. The claim does not consider the infrastructure needed to transmit this energy efficiently.
3. **Storage and Distribution**: Solar energy is intermittent, requiring storage solutions like batteries. The claim does not address the need for storage and distribution infrastructure.
4. **Geographical Distribution**: The claim assumes that all the energy can be collected and used in one area, ignoring the need for a nationwide grid and distribution system.

Answer: 0"
718,"Explanation: Bernie Sanders has been a consistent advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, including same-sex marriage, for many years. In 2000, he voted against a bill that would have allowed same-sex couples to marry in Vermont, but he has since changed his stance and has been a strong supporter of same-sex marriage. Therefore, the claim that he was there when it came to same-sex marriage 20 years ago is true.

Answer: 1"
719,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as ObamaCare, does not require all persons enrolled in insurance plans to pay an abortion premium. The ACA prohibits federal funds from being used to pay for abortions, but it does not mandate that all insurance plans cover abortions. Additionally, the ACA allows states to opt out of covering abortions in their Medicaid programs. Therefore, the claim that the administration has issued rules for $1 abortions and requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay an abortion premium is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
720,"Explanation: Rick Perry served as the Governor of Texas from 2007 to 2015. Before his political career, he worked as a businessman and ran a family business. Therefore, the claim that he has never held a private-sector job is false.

Answer: 0"
721,"Explanation: The claim that illegal immigration costs state taxpayers over $3 billion every year is often cited in political debates but is not supported by comprehensive, widely accepted studies. The $3 billion figure is often derived from a 2017 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which has been criticized for its methodology and bias. Other studies and analyses have found that the economic impact of illegal immigration is more nuanced and often positive, with immigrants contributing to the economy through taxes and labor. Therefore, the claim is not supported by reliable, widely accepted evidence.

Answer: 0"
722,"Explanation: The claim states that a liberal immigration reform group endorsed Dave Brat, a GOP primary opponent. However, there is no specific mention of which liberal immigration reform group is being referred to, and no evidence is provided to support this claim. Without specific details or credible sources, it is not possible to verify the truth of this statement.

Answer: 0"
723,"Explanation: The claim that welders make more money than philosophers is not universally true. The income of individuals in these professions can vary greatly depending on factors such as location, experience, education, and specific job roles. While welders in certain industries or regions may earn more than philosophers, the reverse can also be true in other contexts. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that welders always make more money than philosophers.

Answer: 0"
724,"Explanation: Teddy Roosevelt did advocate for health care reform, but the claim that he ""first called for (health care) reform nearly a century ago"" is misleading. Roosevelt's advocacy for health care reform was in the early 20th century, but the term ""nearly a century ago"" suggests a much earlier time period. Therefore, the claim is false.

Therefore, it is impossible to confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
728,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by John Brennan, the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), regarding the geographic limitations of drone strikes.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, for instance, introduced several new provisions and changes to the tax code. Therefore, the statement that there have been ""literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986"" is accurate.

Answer: 1"

Answer: 0"
736,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want to raise taxes on all income brackets is a generalization that is not accurate. While both have proposed tax increases on higher income brackets, they have not advocated for raising taxes on all income brackets. Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign platform included proposals to increase the top marginal tax rate and close loopholes for the wealthy, but she did not propose a tax increase for all income brackets. Similarly, Barack Obama's tax policies during his presidency focused on increasing taxes for the wealthy and closing loopholes, but he did not propose a tax increase for all income brackets. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
737,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss votes more with Democrats than with conservatives is false. Chambliss is a Republican and has consistently voted with the Republican Party. According to the Washington Post's ""Congressional Voting Score"" for the 116th Congress, Chambliss voted with Republicans 95% of the time and with Democrats 5% of the time. This indicates that he is a conservative and votes primarily with his party.

Answer: 0"

740,"Explanation: The claim that this is the first time since World War II that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together is false. There have been instances in the past where multiple nuclear-powered aircraft carriers have been docked together. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Harry S. Truman, were docked together in the Persian Gulf. Additionally, the U.S. Navy has conducted exercises with multiple carriers in the past, such as the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, where multiple carriers have been present.

Answer: 0"
741,"Explanation: The claim states that at 50 Milwaukee schools serving at least 80% African-American and at least 80% low-income students, the reading proficiency is 8%.

Therefore, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Answer: 0"
742,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not mandate that small businesses adopt a specific health care plan. Instead, it provides options for small businesses to offer health insurance to their employees. The penalty for not offering health insurance to employees is not a fine but a tax on the employer if they have 50 or more full-time equivalent employees and do not offer affordable health insurance. Additionally, the ACA does not apply to businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

Answer: 0"
743,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin has fallen to dead last in Midwest job growth is based on the latest job numbers.

Answer: 0"
744,"Explanation: The claim refers to the Baucus bill, which is a reference to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) proposed by Senator Max Baucus. The ACA, as passed, does not provide federal funds to subsidize coverage of elective abortions. The ACA includes provisions that prohibit federal funds from being used for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
745,"Explanation: The claim that ""Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans"" is not accurate. While there are varying opinions on cap-and-trade policies, numerous polls and surveys have shown that a significant portion of Americans support or are neutral towards such policies. For instance, a 2021 poll by the Yale Climate Communications program found that 69% of Americans support a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the claim that cap-and-trade is ""wildly unpopular"" is an oversimplification and not supported by data.

However, the claim does not specify the time period for the current imports, making it impossible to verify the claim without additional context. Therefore, the claim is false as it stands because it lacks specific information to support the comparison.

Answer: 0"
750,"Explanation: The claim that four-year terms for City Council members are the norm in most cities of our size is not accurate. The term length for City Council members varies widely across different cities and countries. While some cities do have four-year terms, many others have two-year terms, and some even have terms of three years or more. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that four-year terms are the norm.

Answer: 0"
751,"Explanation: Tommy Thompson is indeed known for his role in welfare reform, but he is not the father of the Wisconsin Works program. The program was created by Governor James E. Doyle in 1996, not by Tommy Thompson.

Answer: 0"
752,"Explanation: The claim that ""We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before"" is not accurate. While the United States has seen an increase in exports in recent years, this does not necessarily mean that the volume of products made in America and sold to the rest of the world is at an all-time high. The claim is misleading because it does not provide context or specify the time period being compared.

Answer: 0"
753,"Explanation: The claim that the costs of cancer and all affiliated issues are over $20 billion a year to this state is not accurate. According to the American Cancer Society, the estimated cost of cancer care in the United States in 2020 was $174 billion. This figure includes direct medical costs, indirect costs (such as lost productivity), and other related expenses. Therefore, the claim that the costs are over $20 billion a year is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
754,"Explanation: The claim ""On a cap-and-trade plan"" is incomplete and lacks context. A cap-and-trade plan is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, where a limit (cap) is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted, and companies can trade emission allowances. Without additional information about the specific context or details of the claim, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
755,"Explanation: The claim that ""The left is blatantly attempting to disrupt Georgia's elections"" is a broad and vague statement that lacks specific evidence or context. Without concrete examples or sources, it is difficult to verify the truth of this claim. Additionally, the term ""the left"" is not defined, and it could refer to various political groups or individuals with different motivations and actions. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
756,"Explanation: The claim that President Barack Obama reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011 is false. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2010, included provisions aimed at reducing prescription drug costs, such as the closing of the Medicare Part D doughnut hole, the specific claim about reducing costs for 3.6 million Americans in 2011 is not accurate. The ACA's provisions to reduce prescription drug costs were implemented over time and did not result in a specific number of Americans seeing reduced costs in 2011.

Answer: 0"
757,"Explanation: Ted Cruz has been a vocal opponent of illegal immigration and has not proposed giving work permits to people in the country illegally.

Answer: 0"
758,"Explanation: The claim that AIG received a provision allowing it to dole out bonuses is false. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was established by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system during the 2008 financial crisis. AIG received $182 billion in bailout funds, but the government did not allow AIG to pay bonuses to its executives. In fact, the government initially prohibited AIG from paying bonuses to its executives, but later allowed it to pay bonuses to certain employees under strict conditions. The claim that AIG received a provision allowing it to dole out bonuses is a misinterpretation of the facts.

Answer: 0"
759,"Explanation: The claim states that former U.S. President Barack Obama bombed 7 countries and former President George W. Bush bombed 4 countries. This claim is false. According to various sources, including the Council on Foreign Relations and the New York Times, the number of countries bombed by Obama and Bush is significantly higher. For example, Obama bombed at least 10 countries, and Bush bombed at least 12 countries. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

This makes Virginia the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore.

Answer: 1"
763,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the position of the McCain campaign to that of Vice President Gore's campaign one week before the 2000 election. In 2000, the election was extremely close, with Gore leading in the polls but ultimately losing to George W. Bush. The McCain campaign, on the other hand, was not in a similar position. John McCain was not leading in the polls and was not in a close race with Barack Obama, who ultimately won the 2008 election. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
764,"Explanation: The claim that ""Health care reform: Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care"" is a generalization and an oversimplification. Health care reform can have various impacts depending on the specific policies and measures implemented. Some reforms may indeed increase costs or taxes, but others aim to reduce costs, improve access, and enhance quality. The claim does not provide specific examples or evidence to support its assertions, making it difficult to judge its accuracy without more context.

Answer: 0"
765,"Explanation: The claim that the United States has spent trillions of dollars since 1965 yet the poverty rate has not budged is misleading. While it is true that the United States has spent significant amounts on various social programs and initiatives aimed at reducing poverty, the poverty rate has indeed fluctuated over time. The poverty rate has decreased in some periods and increased in others, but it has not remained static. For instance, the poverty rate was around 15% in the 1960s, dropped to around 11% in the 1970s, and has fluctuated since then, reaching a low of 11.3% in 2000 and a high of 15.1% in 2010. Therefore, the claim that the poverty rate has not budged is false.

Answer: 0"
766,"Explanation: The claim that New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade is not accurate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's data, several states have seen a decrease in spending on higher education since the beginning of the decade. For instance, states like California, Florida, and Texas have also experienced a decline in higher education spending. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
767,"Explanation: The claim that a million people come into the U.S. legally each year is not accurate. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the number of people who obtain lawful permanent resident status (green card) annually is around 1 million, but this includes both new immigrants and those who adjust their status. However, the number of new immigrants (those who are not already in the U.S. and obtain a green card) is significantly lower. The claim that no other country comes close to this figure is also misleading, as many countries have similar or higher numbers of legal immigrants.

Answer: 0"
768,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush, a Republican, did not expand government health care. Instead, it created a new program called Medicare Part D, which provides prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. This program was not an expansion of government health care but rather a new addition to the existing Medicare program.

770,"Explanation: The claim is false. The unemployment rate in Shelby County, Tennessee, was indeed 4.8% when Congressman Steve Cohen took office in 2007.

The unemployment rate in Shelby County has fluctuated over the years, but it has not reached 9.7% as of the latest data available.

Answer: 0"
771,"Explanation: The claim that the Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country is not accurate. While the Koch brothers, through their companies, have been involved in various industries that contribute to pollution, such as fossil fuel extraction and manufacturing, they are not among the top polluters in the country. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists the top polluters by industry, and the Koch brothers' companies are not among the top emitters of greenhouse gases or other pollutants.

Answer: 0"
772,"Explanation: The claim that Texas is the only state that exempts jet fuel from its state motor fuels tax is false. While Texas does have a unique tax structure for jet fuel, it is not the only state that exempts jet fuel from its motor fuels tax. Several other states, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Wyoming, also have similar exemptions. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
773,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the likelihood of a baby being born to a mother who used tobacco during pregnancy in Coos County is twice the average for Oregon or the U.S. This claim is not supported by any specific data or study that I can find. The likelihood of a baby being born to a mother who used tobacco during pregnancy can vary based on numerous factors, including regional health trends, socioeconomic factors, and access to healthcare. Without specific data or a study to back up this claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy.

Answer: 0"
774,"Explanation: The claim states that neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years. To verify this, I would need to check the official records or reports from the county government regarding the funding allocated to the school systems over the past six years. Without specific data or official statements, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false or cannot be verified as true without specific data.)"
775,"Explanation: The claim ""On reconciliation"" is incomplete and lacks context. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false.

Answer: 0"
776,"Explanation: As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time data to verify the current unemployment rate in Virginia. However, historical data shows that the unemployment rate in Virginia has been relatively low in recent years, but it's not accurate to say it's the lowest in Virginia history without specific data points. The claim could be true or false depending on the exact time frame and data source.

Answer: 0/1"
777,"Explanation: The claim that Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education is not accurate. According to reliable sources, the budget cuts for education in Trenton were significantly lower than $1.3 billion. The actual cuts were around $100 million, which is a substantial amount but not $1.3 billion. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and false.

Answer: 0"
778,"Explanation: The claim is false. Colorado does not have a law that allows residents to print ballots from their home computers and then encourages them to turn ballots over to collectors. Colorado's mail-in voting system does allow residents to request and receive ballots by mail, but the process does not involve printing ballots at home. Additionally, the practice of ""ballot harvesting"" is illegal in Colorado, where it is a felony to collect and submit ballots on behalf of others.

Answer: 0"
779,"Explanation: The claim that ""not a single soldier died in combat during the Eisenhower Administration"" is false. During the Eisenhower Administration, which lasted from 1953 to 1961, the United States was involved in the Korean War and the early stages of the Vietnam War. Both of these conflicts resulted in American casualties. For example, the Korean War alone resulted in over 36,000 American deaths.

Answer: 0"
780,"Explanation: The Keystone XL pipeline is a proposed oil pipeline that would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States. The pipeline has been a subject of controversy and debate, with some supporting its construction for economic reasons and others opposing it due to environmental concerns. The claim itself does not provide specific information that can be verified as true or false, as it is a general statement about the pipeline. Therefore, without additional context or specific claims, it is not possible to definitively judge the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
781,"Explanation: The claim is false. Senator Dianne Feinstein has not made such a statement. She has been a strong advocate for gun control, but her public statements have not included the specific phrase ""Give me your guns, I'm rounding them up.""

783,"Explanation: The claim that by 2015, the United States would be sending so much interest to China that it would be paying for the entire People's Liberation Army is highly unlikely and not supported by any credible sources. The claim is hyperbolic and does not reflect the actual economic and political dynamics between the U.S. and China. The U.S. does not have the capability or intention to finance the entire Chinese military.

Answer: 0"
784,"Explanation: The Budget Control Act of 2011 was indeed passed by the U.S. Senate, along with the U.S. House of Representatives, and signed into law by President Barack Obama. It was designed to address the federal budget deficit and prevent a default on the national debt. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
785,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Medicare officials have treated Humana and AARP differently in terms of communication with seniors. However, there is no specific evidence or source provided to support this claim. Medicare's communication policies are typically consistent and based on regulations and guidelines, not on the specific organization or entity they are communicating with. Therefore, the claim is not supported by available information.

Answer: 0"
786,"Explanation: The Islamic State (ISIS) is known for its extremist activities and has been involved in various atrocities, including the destruction of cultural heritage sites. However, building a hotel is not a typical activity associated with ISIS. The group is more focused on military operations, propaganda, and the establishment of a caliphate rather than constructing hotels. Therefore, this claim is likely to be false.

Answer: 0"
787,"Explanation: The claim suggests that Iranians are now stating that their understanding of the deal differs from what was previously stated. This claim is not verifiable with concrete evidence or a specific source. It is a general statement that could be true or false depending on the context and the specific deal being referred to. Without additional context or a reliable source, it is impossible to definitively judge the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
788,"Explanation: The claim that the federal government has 77 different means-tested social welfare programs is not accurate. While the federal government does have numerous social welfare programs, the exact number of means-tested programs can vary depending on the source and the definition of ""means-tested."" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 80 means-tested programs, but this number can fluctuate. Therefore, the claim of 77 programs is not precise and can be considered false.

Answer: 0"
789,"Explanation: The claim ""I have returned money every year since taking office"" is vague and lacks specific details. It does not provide information about the amount of money returned, the context in which it was returned, or the specific years in question. Without concrete evidence or a clear definition of what ""returning money"" means in this context, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Answer: 0"

According to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, the number of immigrants detained annually has been fluctuating but has not increased dramatically from about 70,000 to 400,000 in the last 15 years. The actual numbers are much lower and have not shown such a significant increase.

Answer: 1"
792,"Explanation: The claim that the approval rating of Congress is down to 13 percent is false.

This claim appears to be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of a specific incident or a general trend in religious education.

Answer: 0"
794,"Explanation: The claim that the United States incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did is false. While it is true that the United States has a disproportionately high rate of incarceration for African-Americans, the percentage of the population incarcerated in South Africa during apartheid was significantly higher. According to various studies and historical records, the incarceration rate in South Africa during apartheid was around 10-15% of the African population, while in the United States, the incarceration rate for African-Americans is around 1-2%.

Answer: 0"
795,"Explanation: The claim is based on specific percentages of Texas high school students meeting college readiness standards in English and math. These figures are not widely reported or verified in standard educational databases or reports. To verify the claim, one would need to consult official Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board reports or other credible educational sources. Without such verification, the claim cannot be confirmed as true.

796,"Explanation: Georgia is indeed known for its high standards in food safety, particularly in the production of peanuts and other agricultural products. The state has implemented stringent regulations and inspections to ensure the quality and safety of its food products. This reputation is well-recognized in the industry and among consumers.

Answer: 1"
797,"Explanation: The claim is false. The fiscal cliff refers to a series of tax increases and spending cuts that were scheduled to take effect at the beginning of 2013. However, lawmakers did not fail to avert the fiscal cliff. In fact, they passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which averted the fiscal cliff and prevented the automatic spending cuts and tax increases. Therefore, the claim that 18 percent of the federal money sent to the states would be eliminated is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
798,"Explanation: The claim that the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000 in 2011 is false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average annual salary for elementary, middle, and high school teachers in the Milwaukee metropolitan area in 2011 was around $55,000 to $60,000. This is significantly lower than the claimed $100,000.

Answer: 0"
799,"Explanation: The claim that U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal eliminates Medicare in 10 years is false. While Ryan's budget proposals have included changes to Medicare, such as raising the eligibility age and changing the way benefits are calculated, they do not eliminate Medicare entirely. The proposals aim to reduce the growth of Medicare spending, but they do not eliminate the program.

Answer: 0"
802,"Explanation: David Cicilline served as the U.S. Representative for Rhode Island's 1st congressional district from 2011 to 2021. He was known for his work on issues such as economic development, education, and healthcare. However, there is no widely reported or verified information that suggests he opposed tough mandatory sentences for those convicted of domestic violence and child abuse. This claim appears to be a misrepresentation of his political stance or actions.

Answer: 0"
803,"Explanation: The claim that Bill White offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants is false. Bill White is a former mayor of Houston, Texas, and he has not been reported to have offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants. The term ""sanctuary city"" typically refers to cities that have policies in place to protect undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement, but there is no evidence to suggest that Bill White has implemented such policies.

Answer: 0"
804,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Republican Party's platform has indeed sought further limits on abortion, but it has not been silent on an exception for rape. The platform has consistently included an exception for rape, incest, or the life of the mother. The claim that the platform has been silent on this exception for more than 30 years is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
805,"Explanation: The claim is false. The new Arizona immigration law, known as SB 1070, allows police to stop and check the immigration status of anyone they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" to believe is in the country illegally. This means that police can stop someone based on factors such as their appearance, behavior, or other indicators, not just if they see something illegal.

Answer: 0"
806,"Explanation: The claim is false. Fox News did not use a photo of a married couple promoting traditional marriage that was actually of a same-sex couple. The photo in question was of a married couple, and the story was about their support for traditional marriage. The claim is a misinterpretation of the story's context.

Answer: 0"
807,"Explanation: The claim that every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases, is not universally true. While some studies suggest that a minimum wage increase can lead to a small increase in unemployment, particularly among low-skilled workers, other studies find no significant effect or even a positive effect on employment. The impact of a minimum wage increase on employment depends on various factors, including the size of the increase, the industry, and the overall economic conditions. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every time the minimum wage is raised, the number of jobless people increases.

Answer: 0"
808,"Explanation: The claim that Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law is true. In 1973, the Trump Management Company was sued by the Justice Department for discriminatory housing practices. The company was accused of refusing to rent apartments to African-Americans and other minorities. The case was settled out of court, with the Trump Organization agreeing to pay $1 million in damages and to rent apartments to minorities. This incident is well-documented in various sources, including the New York Times and the Washington Post.

Answer: 1"
809,"Explanation: The National Park Service (NPS) is a federal agency in the United States, while the city of Austin is a local government entity. The NPS's annual budget is funded by the federal government and is typically much larger than the budget of a single city. For example, in 2021, the NPS's budget was approximately $3.7 billion, while the city of Austin's budget was around $1.2 billion. Therefore, the claim that the NPS has an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin is false.

Answer: 0"
810,"Explanation: The claim is a statement of irony, not a factual claim. It suggests that it is ironic that First Energy Corp., which supplies electricity to Cleveland Public Power, is also having its name on the football stadium. This is a subjective interpretation and does not provide a factual statement that can be verified as true or false.

Answer: 0"
813,"Explanation: The claim that Virginia's ban on felons from voting is a Jim Crow-era law is false. The Jim Crow laws were a series of state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. These laws were enacted between 1877 and 1950, and they were designed to disenfranchise and discriminate against African Americans. Virginia's current felon disenfranchisement law, which was passed in 1902, is not a Jim Crow-era law. It was passed before the Jim Crow era and was not intended to target African Americans specifically.

Answer: 0"
814,"Explanation: The claim that ""We've broken by millions the all-time record for votes in a GOP presidential primary election"" is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no evidence to support that any GOP presidential primary election has broken the all-time record for votes by millions. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of actual voting numbers.

Answer: 0"
815,"Explanation: The claim that only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teenagers or young people is likely false. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021, about 14% of minimum wage workers were between the ages of 16 and 19, and 25% were between the ages of 20 and 24. This means that a significant portion of minimum wage workers are indeed teenagers or young adults, not just one out of 10.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
817,"Explanation: The claim is based on a general statement about the national economic recovery and its impact on state tax revenues and budget surpluses. While it is true that many states have experienced economic growth and increased tax revenues, it is not accurate to say that nearly every state has seen higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses. The economic recovery has been uneven, with some states benefiting more than others. Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
818,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the house, the rates being stabilized, or the process of using the proceeds from the sale to stabilize rates. It lacks context and specific information, making it difficult to verify its truthfulness.

819,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual's actions against budget cuts to public education. Without specific evidence or context, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy.

Answer: 0/1"
820,"Explanation: The claim is made by the Trump family, and it is a statement about their net worth when they moved into the White House. The claim is that they had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman. This claim is false because the Trump family's net worth was significantly higher than that of the Truman family when they moved into the White House. The Trump family's net worth was estimated to be around $3.7 billion, while the Truman family's net worth was much lower.

Answer: 0"
821,"Explanation: The claim that easing restrictions on selling alcohol on Sundays will result in more traffic crashes and fatalities is based on the assumption that increased alcohol consumption will lead to more impaired driving. While it is true that alcohol consumption can impair judgment and motor skills, leading to an increased risk of traffic crashes and fatalities, the claim does not provide specific evidence or data to support the assertion that easing restrictions on Sunday alcohol sales will directly cause more crashes and fatalities. The impact of such a policy change would depend on various factors, including the current alcohol consumption patterns, enforcement of drunk driving laws, and public awareness campaigns.

Answer: 0"
822,"Explanation: The Tea Party is not a registered political party in the United States, and therefore, it does not have official polling data like the Republican and Democratic parties. Polling data for political parties typically refers to the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The claim is comparing a non-registered political movement to registered political parties, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
823,"Explanation: The claim is false. The number of individuals on death row who have completed all appellate review and are awaiting the governor's signature on a death warrant is not approximately 40. The actual number is much lower. As of 2021, there were around 2,500 individuals on death row in the United States, and the number of those who have completed all appellate review and are awaiting execution is significantly less than 40.

Answer: 0"
824,"Explanation: Proposition 57, also known as the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016, is a California ballot initiative that was passed in 2016. It aims to reduce the state prison population by allowing non-violent, non-serious offenders to be eligible for parole after serving the full term of their primary offense. However, it does not provide any form of immunity or ""get out of jail free"" card for violent crimes such as drive-by shootings or discharging guns on a school yard. These actions are still considered serious crimes and would result in severe penalties, including long jail sentences. Therefore, the claim that Proposition 57 would allow individuals to commit these crimes and ""get out of jail free"" is false.

Answer: 0"
825,"Explanation: The claim refers to a group of senators known as the ""Gang of 14,"" which was formed in 2007 to prevent the Senate from becoming gridlocked. The group consisted of seven Republicans and seven Democrats. The claim also mentions that Sen. Obama (Barack Obama) had the opportunity to join this group but chose not to. However, Sen. Obama was not a senator in 2007; he was a senator-elect at the time and was not yet in office. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
826,"Explanation: The claim that Gov. Nathan Deal has taken at least $15,600 from the Koch brothers, their businesses, and their employees is false. There is no evidence or record of such a transaction.

Answer: 0"
827,"Explanation: The claim about a man using bath salts and having raccoons set fire inside his home and steal his cell phone is highly unlikely. Bath salts are a type of drug that can cause hallucinations and paranoia, but they do not cause raccoons to set fires or steal cell phones. Raccoons are not known to use tools or set fires, and they typically do not steal cell phones. This claim appears to be a mix of fact and fiction, with the bath salts and raccoons elements being false.

Answer: 0"
828,"Explanation: The claim is based on a simplified calculation that does not account for the fact that Medicare taxes are paid over a lifetime, while benefits are received over a shorter period. The claim also does not consider the fact that Medicare taxes are paid by both the employee and the employer, and that the benefits are not solely for the retiree but also for their spouse and dependents. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that Medicare benefits are not received in a lump sum but are spread out over the retiree's lifetime.

Answer: 0"
829,"Explanation: The claim that Scott Walker would ban stem cell research is false. Scott Walker, who served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, did not propose or implement a ban on stem cell research. In fact, he supported research on stem cells, including embryonic stem cells, during his tenure as governor.

Answer: 0"
830,"Explanation: The claim is based on a specific year (2010) and provides a combined figure for the top 10 CEOs' salaries. However, it does not provide a source or specific data to verify the claim. Additionally, the claim about the average American worker's wage rising by just 2 percent is not directly related to the CEOs' salaries and does not provide a source for this information either. Therefore, without a reliable source, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0"
831,"Explanation: The claim that law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population is supported by several studies and reports. For instance, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that law enforcement officers have a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other causes compared to the general population. This increased risk is often attributed to the stress and physical demands of the job, as well as exposure to hazards. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"
832,"Explanation: The claim that suicide is caused by a federal government policy of giving people something for nothing is a misinterpretation and a false narrative. Suicide is a complex issue influenced by a multitude of factors, including mental health, socioeconomic status, personal relationships, and individual circumstances. The claim suggests a simplistic and inaccurate cause-and-effect relationship between government policies and suicide rates, which is not supported by evidence or expert consensus.

Answer: 0"
833,"Explanation: The claim is false. The House of Representatives has been controlled by the Democratic Party since the 2018 midterm elections. The claim that the House has been malfunctioning due to a lack of control is not accurate. Additionally, the claim that only 49 out of 109 scheduled sessions were held is incorrect. The House has held all of its scheduled sessions.

Answer: 0"
834,"Explanation: The United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) does not infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms. The treaty aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms, including small arms and light weapons, to prevent their diversion to unauthorized users. It does not restrict the ownership of firearms within a country's borders. The treaty's provisions are designed to promote responsible arms transfers and prevent the proliferation of weapons that could be used in human rights abuses or terrorism. Therefore, the claim that the U.N. Arms Treaty infringes upon the right to keep and bear arms is false.

Answer: 0"
835,"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the House and Republican, has historically been a skeptic of the scientific consensus on global warming. Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and current Speaker of the House, is a strong advocate for addressing climate change. While both have expressed some willingness to work together on certain issues, their positions on global warming are fundamentally opposed. Therefore, the claim that Newt Gingrich is aligned with Nancy Pelosi on global warming is false.

Answer: 0"
836,"Explanation: The claim that Purim is ""their version of Halloween here"" is false. Purim and Halloween are distinct holidays with different origins, traditions, and purposes. Purim is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people in the ancient Persian Empire from a plot to annihilate them. It is celebrated with a public reading of the Book of Esther, giving gifts to the poor, and a festive meal. In contrast, Halloween is a secular holiday that originated in the United States and is celebrated with activities like trick-or-treating, wearing costumes, and decorating with pumpkins and ghosts. While both holidays involve some form of celebration and dressing up, they are not interchangeable or equivalent.

Answer: 0"
837,"Explanation: The claim is false. Rick Scott, the former governor of Florida, has not been charged with any crime that would lead to imprisonment. He has faced legal challenges and investigations, but none have resulted in criminal charges or imprisonment. Therefore, the claim that he ""barely escaped imprisonment"" is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
838,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the IRS, in 2019, about 44% of Americans did not pay any federal income tax. However, this does not mean that they do not pay any taxes at all. Many Americans pay other types of taxes, such as payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare), state and local taxes, and property taxes. Additionally, the wealthiest Americans do pay a significant portion of the federal income tax. In 2019, the top 1% of earners paid 40.1% of the total federal income tax collected.

Answer: 0"
839,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the assets of the six largest banks in the United States over two different time periods. The first part of the claim states that 15 years ago, the assets of the six largest banks totaled 17 percent of GDP. The second part of the claim states that today, the assets of the six largest banks total 63 percent of GDP. These figures are not directly comparable because they are from different time periods and the economic conditions may have changed significantly over those 15 years. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable as it stands without additional context or data.

Answer: 0"
840,"Explanation: The claim is true. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States became a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products in 2019 and has been a net exporter since then. This means that the U.S. produces more oil than it imports from other countries.

Answer: 1"
841,"Explanation: The claim that the largest category of people coming into technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees is likely false. Technical schools typically attract individuals who are seeking vocational training or have completed high school or some college, rather than those with four-year degrees. The primary goal of technical schools is to provide hands-on training for specific trades and industries, which is often more appealing to those who have completed high school or some college-level education.

Answer: 0"
842,"Explanation: The claim that Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years is false. Brazil is still a significant oil producer and exporter. In fact, Brazil is one of the world's largest oil producers, with the discovery of the pre-salt oil fields in the 2000s significantly increasing its oil production. As of 2021, Brazil is the 12th largest oil producer globally and the 10th largest exporter.

Answer: 0"
843,"Explanation: The claim that Louisiana gets ""not one single penny"" from Gulf Coast offshore oil revenues is false.

This revenue is used for various purposes, including coastal restoration and conservation projects.

Answer: 0"
844,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not make it unlawful for individuals to not purchase health insurance. The ACA's individual mandate, which required most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, was repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. However, the mandate itself was not deemed unlawful; it was simply repealed. Therefore, there is no law that makes not purchasing health insurance unlawful.

Answer: 0"
848,"Explanation: The claim that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt felt there was no need for collective bargaining in the public sector because ""the government is the people"" is a misinterpretation of his views. Roosevelt was a strong advocate for labor rights and supported collective bargaining for private sector workers. However, his views on public sector collective bargaining were more nuanced and evolved over time. He initially opposed it, but later supported it, especially after World War II. Therefore, the claim is false.

851,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia ranks No. 9 in the rate of women murdered by men is not accurate. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the rate of intentional homicide of women by men varies by country, and Georgia does not rank No. 9 in this category. The UNODC's data shows that the rate of intentional homicide of women by men is highest in countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and South Africa, not Georgia.

853,"Explanation: The claim is false. Kelly Ayotte, a former U.S. Senator from New Hampshire, voted against a proposal to expand background checks in 2016. However, the claim that ""buyers can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks"" is misleading. The proposal in question was the ""Manchin-Toomey Amendment,"" which would have expanded background checks to cover gun shows and online sales. Ayotte's vote was against this specific proposal, not against background checks in general. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"

855,"Explanation: Texas law does require schools to teach sex education, but it is not mandatory for schools to teach comprehensive sex education. The Texas Education Code requires that schools provide instruction on human sexuality, but the curriculum must be age-appropriate and medically accurate. However, schools are not required to teach comprehensive sex education, which includes topics like contraception, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Therefore, the claim that ""schools do not even have to teach sex education"" is false.

862,"Explanation: The claim that Marco Rubio spent $400K of your tax dollars remodeling offices and building a members-only lounge is false. There is no credible source or evidence to support this claim. The U.S. Senate does not have a budget for members-only lounges, and any remodeling of offices would be part of the overall Senate budget, not a separate expense.

Answer: 0"
863,"Explanation: The claim is partially true. While it is accurate that certain areas in the United States, such as Oakland and Ferguson, have higher crime rates compared to other parts of the country, it is an oversimplification to say that these places are among the most dangerous in the world. The claim also does not provide context or data to support the assertion that these places are worse than other dangerous areas globally. Additionally, it is important to note that crime rates can vary significantly within a city, and many areas in these cities are not as dangerous as the overall statistics might suggest.

Answer: 0"
864,"Explanation: The claim that Bush's tax cuts for high earners have been the biggest contributor to the budget deficit is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the Bush-era tax cuts, particularly those for high earners, did contribute to the budget deficit, they were not the sole or even the primary cause. Other factors, such as increased military spending, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the economic downturn following the 2008 financial crisis, also played significant roles in the growth of the budget deficit during the Bush administration. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely true.

The claim of a 71 times injection is not supported by scientific evidence or medical practices.

871,"Explanation: The claim that 94 percent of carbon emissions are caused by nature is false.

Answer: 0"
872,"Explanation: Sen. Barbara Boxer was a prominent figure in the U.S. Senate and was known for her stance on immigration reform. However, the claim that she voted against immigration reform to permit Hispanic immigrants to come here legally to work is misleading. Sen. Boxer was a strong advocate for comprehensive immigration reform and supported measures to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. She voted in favor of the DREAM Act and other immigration reform bills. Therefore, the claim that she voted against immigration reform to prevent Hispanic immigrants from coming here legally is false.

Answer: 0"
873,"Explanation: The claim that the only growth sector in America in the last two years has been government growth is misleading.

Answer: 0"
874,"Explanation: The claim is vague and does not provide specific details about the plan or the costs it aims to reduce. It also does not specify who ""many observers"" are or what their credentials are.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: 0"
875,"Explanation: The claim is false. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, as of 2021, 38 states have appointed, rather than elected, state school superintendents.

The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the dogs' contributions.

Answer: 0"
878,"Explanation: The claim about tourism in Ohio can be verified by checking reliable sources such as the Ohio Department of Commerce or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the Ohio Department of Commerce, tourism in Ohio supports over 439,000 jobs and generates over $36 billion in annual spending. These figures are consistent with the claim made.

Answer: 1"
879,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the growth in food stamp usage did not keep pace with the increase in unemployment. This statement is generally true. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in unemployment, but the growth in food stamp usage, while substantial, did not match the rate of increase in unemployment. This discrepancy can be attributed to various factors, including the timing of stimulus payments and the implementation of unemployment benefits.

Answer: 1"
880,"Explanation: The claim states that nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days after the shootings of Dallas policemen. This claim is false because it is not supported by any credible sources or official records. The Dallas Police Department did not report such a high number of applications in such a short period following the shootings.

Answer: 0"
881,"Explanation: The claim is based on the gender wage gap, which is a well-documented phenomenon. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2020, women in Oregon earned 83.4% of what men earned, which is approximately 79 cents for every dollar paid to men. The claim then uses this figure to calculate the potential benefits if the wage gap were eliminated. The calculations are based on the average cost of gas, food, and rent in Oregon, which are reasonable assumptions. Therefore, the claim is true.

Answer: 1"

884,"Explanation: House Bill 2 (HB2), also known as the ""Bathroom Bill,"" was a controversial law passed in North Carolina in 2016. It required individuals to use public restrooms that corresponded to their birth sex, rather than their gender identity. This law was widely criticized for discriminating against transgender individuals and was later repealed in 2017. The claim that ""We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina with the passage of HB2"" is false because HB2 did indeed take away certain rights, specifically the right of transgender individuals to use restrooms that align with their gender identity.

Answer: 0"

888,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders have identical positions on healthcare is false. While all three candidates have proposed healthcare reforms, their plans differ significantly. Hillary Clinton's plan, for instance, was to expand the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), while Bernie Sanders proposed a Medicare for All system. Donald Trump's plan involved repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. None of these plans put the government in charge of both the patient and the doctor, as the claim suggests.

They moved to Atlanta in 1966 and have been known as the Atlanta Braves since then.

Answer: 1"
890,"Explanation: The claim that there are 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day is not accurate. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, as of 2021, there are approximately 20 million veterans in the United States. However, the number of veterans who are homeless or on the street at any given time is significantly lower. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that around 40,000 veterans are homeless on any given night. Therefore, the claim that there are 200,000 to 400,000 veterans on the street is an exaggeration.

The claim misrepresents the content and structure of the article.

Answer: 0"
892,"Explanation: The claim states that 5,400 jobs were lost in the first 12 months of the smoking ban implementation in Ohio's hospitality industry.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Answer: 0"
893,"Explanation: The claim that Mexico does not have birthright citizenship and that Americans are the only ones to have it is false. Mexico does have birthright citizenship, which means that anyone born in Mexico is automatically a Mexican citizen. The United States is one of the few countries that grants citizenship to anyone born within its borders, regardless of the parents' immigration status, but this is not the only country with such a policy. Other countries, including Mexico, also have similar provisions.

894,"Explanation: The claim that Richmond is the most vegan-friendly city is not accurate. While Richmond does have a growing vegan scene with numerous vegan restaurants and shops, it is not the most vegan-friendly city in the United States.

The release of oil from the SPR is typically done in response to specific events, such as natural disasters or market disruptions, and is not a routine or ongoing process.

Answer: 0"
900,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Obama administration did not intend to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations.

Answer: 0"
901,"Explanation: The claim that labor union president Andy Stern is the most frequent visitor at the White House is false.

902,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists is a complex issue that has been debated in various contexts. While it is true that some extremist groups have used Trump's rhetoric and policies to recruit new members, it is not accurate to say that he is being used as a ""recruiting tool"" in the same way that a specific organization or individual might be. The claim is vague and lacks specific evidence to support it.

Answer: 0"
903,"Explanation: The claim ""On a cap-and-trade plan"" is incomplete and lacks context. A cap-and-trade plan is a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, where a limit (cap) is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted, and companies can trade emission allowances. Without additional information about the specific context or details of the claim, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness.

Answer: 0"
904,"Explanation: Lyndon B. Johnson's stance on civil rights was complex and evolved over time. While it is true that he initially opposed many civil rights measures during his early years in Congress, he later became a strong advocate for civil rights legislation. In 1957, he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, but by the time he became President in 1963, he had shifted his position and played a crucial role in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Therefore, the claim that he opposed every civil rights measure that came up for a vote during his first 20 years in Congress is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
905,"Explanation: The claim that the Keystone XL pipeline would employ 20,000 people in the United States is an overestimation. While the pipeline's construction would create jobs, the actual number of jobs created is significantly lower. According to various studies and reports, the Keystone XL pipeline would create around 4,000 to 6,000 jobs during construction, with a smaller number of permanent jobs after completion. Therefore, the claim that it would employ 20,000 people is false.

Answer: 0"
906,"Explanation: The claim is false. In most jurisdictions, cyclists are required to follow the same traffic rules as motor vehicles. This means that cyclists must yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, and they must not block the crosswalk. Dipping a wheel into the road does not give cyclists any special legal rights to stop traffic. Cyclists must use hand signals and follow traffic signals just like any other vehicle.

Answer: 0"
907,"Explanation: Joe Garcia is a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the 23rd congressional district of Texas. He served from 2013 to 2019. Utility rates are typically regulated by state or local governments, not individual members of Congress. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Joe Garcia raised utility rates on families.

Answer: 0"
908,"Explanation: The claim that the lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less on healthcare is not accurate. According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks 38th in life expectancy at birth, while many countries with lower healthcare spending, such as Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland, rank much higher. Additionally, the U.S. spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country, but this does not translate to a longer lifespan. The claim oversimplifies the complex relationship between healthcare spending and life expectancy.

Answer: 0"

Without specific details about the bill and its potential economic impacts, it is not possible to accurately assess the claim.

Answer: 0"
912,"Explanation: The claim that a large majority of Republicans believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim and not U.S.-born is false. While there have been some conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns suggesting that Obama is not a U.S.-born citizen or is a Muslim, these claims are not supported by evidence and are widely rejected by fact-checking organizations. Polls and surveys have shown that a significant portion of Republicans do not believe these claims, and the majority of Republicans do not hold these views.

Answer: 0"
913,"Explanation: The claim that the Washington D.C.-area never has a recession is false. While the D.C. area has experienced economic growth and stability, it has not been immune to economic downturns. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the D.C. area experienced job losses and economic slowdown, similar to other regions in the United States. Therefore, the claim that the D.C.-area never has a recession is inaccurate.

916,"Explanation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2010, was designed to address the causes of the 2008 financial crisis. While it has had significant impacts on the banking industry, including increased regulatory requirements and capital requirements, it is not accurate to say that it is ""destroying"" community banks. Many community banks have adapted to the new regulations and continue to operate, although some have faced challenges. The claim is an oversimplification and is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
917,"Explanation: The claim that an entry-level janitor in New York City gets paid twice as much as an entry-level teacher is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for a janitor in New York City was $35,000 in 2020, while the median annual wage for a kindergarten teacher was $55,000. Therefore, the janitor earns less than half of what an entry-level teacher earns.

918,"Explanation: The claim that there is no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections is false. There is a significant body of research and historical data that shows a correlation between primary turnout and the success of candidates in the general election. Higher primary turnout often indicates a more engaged and mobilized electorate, which can translate to better performance in the general election. Therefore, the claim is not supported by evidence.

Answer: 0"
919,"Explanation: The claim that Africa is spending the highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world is not accurate. According to the World Bank, in 2019, the average expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP in Africa was around 4.4%, which is lower than the global average of 4.8%. Countries like South Korea and the United States spend a higher percentage of their GDP on education.

Answer: 0"
920,"Explanation: The claim that any academic benefits of government-funded preschool disappear by the fourth grade is not supported by recent studies. Research has shown that the benefits of preschool education can last well beyond the fourth grade. For instance, a study published in the journal ""Science"" in 2019 found that children who attended high-quality preschool programs had better academic outcomes and were more likely to graduate from high school and attend college. Another study by the Brookings Institution in 2018 also found that the benefits of preschool education can persist into adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
921,"Explanation: The claim is based on a common misconception about income tax distribution. While it is true that the top 1 percent of income earners often pay a significant portion of income taxes, the statement that those at the bottom pay little or nothing is an oversimplification. Many low-income individuals do not pay income taxes because they have little or no taxable income, but they do pay other taxes such as sales taxes, property taxes, and payroll taxes. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
922,"Explanation: The claim that a particular state has more children's hospitals than any other state in the union is not verifiable without specific data. The number of children's hospitals can vary based on population, healthcare needs, and other factors. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say that one state has more children's hospitals than any other without concrete evidence.

Answer: 0"
923,"Explanation: The claim that many workers in Malaysia are indentured servants because their passports are taken away and they work in slave-like conditions is a misrepresentation of the situation. While it is true that some workers in Malaysia, particularly those from countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Indonesia, may face exploitation and have their passports held by their employers, this does not constitute indentured servitude. Indentured servitude is a legal term that refers to a contract of labor for a fixed period, often with the promise of freedom upon completion. In Malaysia, while there are issues of exploitation and abuse, the legal status of workers is not that of indentured servants. The claim also oversimplifies the complex issues of labor migration and exploitation.

Answer: 0"
924,"Explanation: The claim that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor was called a racist is false. While there have been criticisms and controversies surrounding her statements and rulings, the specific claim that she was called a racist by a particular individual or group is not accurate. The misconception might arise from her comments about the ""wise Latina"" and her views on judicial philosophy, but these comments were not made in the context of being called a racist.

Answer: 0"
925,"Explanation: The claim that ""ninety six percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses"" is not accurate. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, in New Hampshire (the Granite State), approximately 98% of businesses are considered small businesses. This means that the claim is exaggerated and not entirely accurate.

Answer: 0"
926,"Explanation: The claim is false. The tax deduction for charitable donations is the same for everyone, regardless of their income level. The amount of tax deduction is based on the amount donated, not the donor's income. Therefore, both a middle-class family and Bill Gates would receive the same tax deduction for a $1 donation.

928,"Explanation: Mitchell International Airport is not the third busiest airport in the world. The third busiest airport in the world is Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the United States. Mitchell International Airport is not even the busiest airport in the country; that title belongs to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Therefore, the claim is false.

Answer: 0"
929,"Explanation: Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, has indeed expressed support for Arizona's immigration law, SB 1070, which requires law enforcement to check the immigration status of individuals they suspect are in the country illegally. However, he has also stated that he believes the law should be implemented in a way that is consistent with the Constitution and that it should not be used to target individuals based on their race or ethnicity. Therefore, while he has supported the law as a model, he has also expressed concerns about its implementation and potential misuse.

Answer: 1"
930,"Explanation: The claim that individuals with mental illnesses die an average of 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness is true. This is supported by numerous studies and reports, including a 2014 study published in the journal ""Lancet Psychiatry"" which found that people with mental health conditions die on average 10-20 years earlier than those without. This is often due to a combination of factors including higher rates of physical health conditions, substance abuse, and suicide.

Answer: 1"
931,"Explanation: The claim that the government, not the armed forces, is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use is false. The U.S. government does not stockpile ammunition for domestic use. The U.S. military, not the government, is responsible for stockpiling ammunition for its own use. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the military's stockpiling activities.

Answer: 0"
932,"Explanation: The claim that ""Six of Georgia's counties have no lawyers at all"" is false. According to the American Bar Association, as of 2021, there are 159 counties in Georgia, and it is highly unlikely that six of them have no lawyers. While some counties may have a shortage of lawyers, it is not accurate to say that six counties have none at all.

Answer: 0"
933,"Explanation: The claim suggests that removing football (soccer) would lead to an increase in crime. This claim is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies on the relationship between sports and crime have shown mixed results, but there is no consistent evidence to suggest that removing football would directly cause an increase in crime. Additionally, the claim does not provide any specific data or studies to support its assertion.

Answer: 0"
934,"Explanation: The claim that the five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are back on the battlefield is false. The five detainees, who were released in exchange for Bergdahl, have not been reported to have returned to the battlefield. The U.S. government has stated that they are not believed to be involved in any ongoing terrorist activities. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the situation and lacks credible evidence.

Answer: 0"
936,"Explanation: Prince William Sound in Alaska has experienced significant environmental impacts due to human activities, including oil spills, logging, and mining. While there are efforts to restore and protect the area, it is not accurate to describe it as ""pristine"" due to these ongoing issues. Therefore, the claim that Prince William Sound is pristine now is false.

Answer: 0"
937,"Explanation: The claim is about the language used in bills that the speaker has supported. It is a subjective statement and cannot be objectively verified without specific details about the bills and the language they contain.

938,"Explanation: According to the College Board's 2021 SAT report, Georgia ranks 39th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in SAT scores. Additionally, Georgia's graduation rate for the class of 2020 was 83.5%, which is below the national average of 86.1%. Therefore, the claim that Georgia is near the bottom among states for SAT scores and graduation rates is true.

Answer: 1"
939,"Explanation: The claim that the United States government has increased its employment base by 176,000 people in the last four years is false. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total employment in the federal government has been relatively stable over the past four years. In fact, the federal government's employment has decreased slightly from 2.7 million in 2017 to 2.6 million in 2021. Therefore, the claim that the government has increased its employment base by 176,000 people is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
940,"Explanation: The claim states that a person has never voted for a federal restriction on gun ownership. To verify this claim, one would need to check the voting records of the person in question. Without specific information about the person's voting history, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be judged as true or false based on the information provided.

Answer: N/A"
941,"Explanation: The claim that 12,808 people were arrested for marijuana-related crimes in Oregon in 2012 is false. According to the Oregon State Police, the number of marijuana-related arrests in 2012 was significantly lower. The actual number of marijuana-related arrests in Oregon in 2012 was around 1,000.

Answer: 0"
942,"Explanation: The claim is about a specific individual's legal actions and political stances. To verify the claim, we need to check if the person in question has indeed sued gun manufacturers and if they were supportive of Brady and assault weapon bans. Without specific names or additional context, it's challenging to confirm the claim's accuracy. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a well-known public figure, such as a politician or activist, we can look up their history to verify the claim.

943,"Explanation: The claim is false. U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, D-Macon, has not sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China. This claim is a misinterpretation or fabrication of his actual activities and policies.

Answer: 0"
944,"Explanation: The claim that the wealth gap between blacks and whites in the United States is greater than the black-white wealth gap in apartheid South Africa is false. While the wealth gap in the United States is significant, it is not greater than the wealth gap in apartheid South Africa. In apartheid South Africa, the wealth gap was extreme due to the systematic and legalized discrimination against the black population. In contrast, while the United States has a significant wealth gap, it is not as extreme as the gap in apartheid South Africa.

Answer: 0"
945,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, redistricting commissions are typically established by state legislatures or through ballot initiatives. The members of these commissions are usually appointed or elected, and they are subject to various ethical standards and laws. If a member of a redistricting commission were to accept a bribe, they would be subject to legal consequences, including removal from the commission. The claim that a member could not be removed is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
946,"Explanation: The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme is false. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit from financial trading. Social Security, on the other hand, is a government-run program that collects taxes from workers and uses those funds to pay benefits to retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased workers. The funds are not used to pay off earlier investors, but rather to provide benefits to current and future retirees based on a pay-as-you-go system. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of a Ponzi scheme.

Answer: 0"
947,"Explanation: The claim that the vast majority of Syrian refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work is a generalization that does not accurately reflect the diversity of the Syrian refugee population. According to various studies and reports from organizations like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Syrian refugee population is diverse and includes people of all ages, genders, and abilities. While it is true that some refugees are young men seeking work, the majority of refugees are women, children, elderly, and those with disabilities. The claim also overlooks the fact that many refugees are fleeing conflict and seeking safety, not necessarily work.

Answer: 0"
948,"Explanation: The claim that ""Our men and women of the Guard have been forced to contact food banks to feed themselves"" is false. This statement is not supported by any credible sources or official statements from the Guard. It is important to verify information from reliable sources before making such claims.

Answer: 0"
949,"Explanation: Scott Walker, a former governor of Wisconsin and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, has been known for his strong stance against abortion. He has supported restrictions on abortion, including a 20-week ban and a requirement for women to view an ultrasound before having an abortion. While his views are indeed restrictive, it is difficult to definitively say that his views are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times. Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush also had strong anti-abortion stances, and some of their policies were similarly restrictive. Therefore, the claim that Walker's views are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
950,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Medicare proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, known as the ""Ryan Budget"" or ""Ryan Plan,"" was a part of the 2012 Republican budget proposal. It did not allow insurance companies to deny coverage or drop people for pre-existing conditions. Instead, it aimed to reduce the federal deficit by making changes to Medicare and other programs. The proposal was criticized for potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries and was not enacted into law.

Answer: 0"
951,"Explanation: The claim states that of the four statewide races this century within a 300-vote margin, three have been overturned in a recount. This claim is false because it is not accurate to say that three out of four such races have been overturned. In fact, only one of the four races within a 300-vote margin in this century has been overturned in a recount. Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not true.

Answer: 0"
952,"Explanation: The claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, the vaccination rate in Texas has not reached 95%. The actual vaccination rate in Texas has been fluctuating but has not exceeded 80% as of the latest data available. Therefore, the claim that the vaccination rate was 95% when the person left office is inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
953,"Explanation: The claim that Central Health is the only hospital district in Texas that spends taxpayer dollars on abortions is false. While Central Health does provide abortion services, it is not the only hospital district in Texas that does so. Other hospital districts in Texas, such as Harris Health System and Parkland Health and Hospital System, also provide abortion services. Therefore, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

Answer: 0"
954,"Explanation: The claim about restoring voting rights to non-violent felons is a complex issue that varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, for example, some states have laws that automatically restore voting rights to non-violent felons upon completion of their sentences, while others do not. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on the specific context and location.

Answer: 0/1"
955,"Explanation: The claim suggests that stories about a person's birth certificate drowned out media coverage of the Republican and White House budget plans.

Answer: 0"
956,"Explanation: The claim is comparing the number of positions eliminated by Chesterfield County's general government operations to the number of positions eliminated by the entire state government of Virginia since 2009. To verify this claim, one would need to obtain specific data on the number of positions eliminated in both entities over the specified period. Without such data, it is impossible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

Answer: 0 (The claim is false as it requires specific data to be verified.)"
957,"Explanation: The claim that the Koch network is spending more money in a Senate race in Ohio than anywhere else in the country is not accurate. While the Koch network has been active in various political races across the country, including in Ohio, there is no evidence to suggest that they are spending more money in Ohio than in any other state. The Koch network's spending is often targeted at specific races and issues, but it is not accurate to say that they are spending more in Ohio than anywhere else.

Answer: 0"
958,"Explanation: The claim that the government does not need a warrant to read your old emails is false. In most jurisdictions, including the United States, the government generally needs a warrant or other legal authorization to access private communications, including old emails. This is governed by laws such as the Fourth Amendment in the U.S., which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, there are exceptions and specific circumstances where such access might be permitted without a warrant, but these are typically limited and require a high standard of evidence.

Answer: 0"
959,"Explanation: The claim that ""The poorest in this country are women"" is a generalization and can be misleading. While it is true that women often face unique challenges such as the gender wage gap and higher rates of poverty due to factors like caregiving responsibilities and lack of access to education and economic opportunities, it is not accurate to say that all women are the poorest in the country. Poverty is a complex issue influenced by various factors including race, ethnicity, age, and geographical location. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
960,"Explanation: The claim is false. Dow Chemical's decision to build a plant in Saudi Arabia rather than Oklahoma is primarily driven by economic factors, such as access to natural gas and other resources, rather than environmental regulations. The company's official statements and reports indicate that the decision was based on strategic business considerations, including market demand and resource availability.

Answer: 0"
962,"Explanation: The claim that Newark was paying 80 percent of its school budget from local property taxes is not accurate. According to the Newark Public Schools' budget reports, the percentage of the budget funded by local property taxes is typically around 30-40%, not 80%. The majority of the budget is funded by state and federal sources.

Answer: 0"
963,"Explanation: The claim that ""In every state, women are paid less than men"" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that, on average, women earn less than men in many states, there are exceptions. For instance, in some states, women may earn more than men on average. Additionally, the wage gap can vary significantly depending on the specific occupation, industry, and other factors. Therefore, the claim is not universally true.

Answer: 0"
964,"Explanation: Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has indeed proposed various immigration reform plans that include legalizing certain groups of undocumented immigrants. However, the specific claim that he has said we should make the 11 million illegal workers legal is not a direct quote from him. He has advocated for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but the exact number of 11 million is not part of his specific proposals.

Answer: 0"
965,"Explanation: The claim that ""Obama 'only wants your children to have health insurance'"" is a misrepresentation of President Obama's policies. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did expand health insurance coverage for children, it also aimed to provide health insurance for adults and improve the overall healthcare system. The claim simplifies and misrepresents the broader goals and impacts of the ACA.

Answer: 0"
966,"Explanation: Josh Mandel, a former Ohio state treasurer and current U.S. Senate candidate, has publicly opposed federal loans to the auto industry. He has argued that such loans are not necessary and that the industry should be allowed to stand on its own merits. This opposition is well-documented in various news articles and political statements.

Answer: 1"
967,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal law known as the ""Gun Control Act of 1968"" prohibits individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes from possessing firearms. This law applies to gun shows and other retail sales of firearms. While there may be some loopholes or inconsistencies in the enforcement of these laws, the claim that convicted abusers can simply walk into a gun show and purchase a gun without any questions asked is an oversimplification and not accurate.

Answer: 0"
968,"Explanation: The claim about the high-speed rail project creating 60,000-plus jobs for Floridians is based on a study conducted by the Florida Department of Transportation. The study estimated that the project would create approximately 60,000 jobs during the construction phase. This claim is supported by official sources and is therefore likely to be true.

Answer: 1"
969,"Explanation: The claim that ""Today almost half our debt is owned by foreigners"" is not accurate. According to the latest data from the U.S. Treasury Department, as of the end of 2021, foreign investors held about 30% of the U.S. public debt. This percentage has been fluctuating over time but has not reached the ""almost half"" threshold.

Answer: 0"
970,"Explanation: The claim states that a specific Republican was the only one to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. To verify this claim, I would need to check the voting records of the House of Representatives for the specific vote in question. However, without specific details about the vote and the member's name, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Answer: 0/1"
971,"Explanation: The claim ""Says he has a track record of not raising taxes"" is vague and does not provide specific details or evidence. To accurately evaluate this claim, we would need more context, such as the name of the person making the claim, the specific time period, and the political or economic context. Without this information, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the statement.

Answer: 0"
972,"Explanation: The claim ""Were No. 1 in child hunger"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. It is not clear what ""Were No. 1"" refers to (e.g., a country, a year, a specific metric). Without additional information, it is impossible to verify the truth of this claim. Therefore, it cannot be accurately judged as true or false.

Answer: 0"
973,"Explanation: Glenn Hegar, the Texas Lieutenant Governor, has been a vocal advocate for reducing public school funding. He has supported legislation that has led to cuts in public school funding. Therefore, it is plausible that he expressed pride in these cuts.

Answer: 1"
974,"Explanation: The claim that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas is false. The U.S. government has long maintained a policy of not providing direct aid to Hamas due to its designation as a terrorist organization. The U.S. has provided humanitarian aid to Gaza through other channels, but this has been done through international organizations and not directly to Hamas. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of U.S. foreign policy.

Answer: 0"
975,"Explanation: The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is making voting more difficult by closing Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices where low-income voters live is a misrepresentation of the facts. The DMV office closures are part of a broader effort to consolidate and streamline government services, not specifically targeted at low-income voters. Additionally, the closures do not directly impact voting, as voters can still register and vote at other DMV offices or through other methods such as absentee voting or early voting.

Answer: 0"
976,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the alternative to higher state worker pension and health care payments is to lay off 1,500 state employees or remove 200,000 children from Medicaid-related programs. This claim is false because it presents a false dichotomy. The alternative to higher state worker pension and health care payments is not necessarily to lay off employees or remove children from Medicaid. There are other options such as reducing other state expenditures, increasing taxes, or finding other sources of revenue. The claim also does not provide any evidence or context to support the numbers given (1,500 layoffs and 200,000 children).

Answer: 0"
977,"Explanation: The claim that we actually don't have that many public employees and are well below average in the number of public employees is false. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United States has one of the highest levels of public employment among developed countries. As of 2021, the U.S. had approximately 2.1 million federal employees, which is a significant number compared to other countries. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. has a low number of public employees is incorrect.

Answer: 0"
978,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Walton family, through their holding company Walton Enterprises, does indeed have significant wealth, but it is not accurate to say that they own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America. According to Forbes, the Walton family's wealth is estimated to be around $200 billion, while the bottom 40 percent of Americans have a combined wealth of around $1.5 trillion. Therefore, the claim that the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"
979,"Explanation: The claim ""On high-speed rail"" is incomplete and lacks specific context or details. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false. High-speed rail systems exist in various countries, but the claim does not specify a particular context or claim about them.

Answer: 0"
980,"Explanation: The claim is false. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) regularly publishes reports on programs at high risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. The GAO's High-Risk List for Fiscal Year 2021, for example, includes programs such as the Department of Defense's acquisition programs, the Department of Health and Human Services' Medicare program, and the Internal Revenue Service's tax administration program. These programs are not targeted for elimination or severe cutback in House Republican spending plans, but they are listed as high-risk programs by the GAO.

Answer: 0"
981,"Explanation: The claim that Hillary Clinton has said she is going to ""wipe out the Second Amendment"" is false. Hillary Clinton has never made such a statement. She has consistently supported gun control measures, but her proposals have not included the elimination of the Second Amendment. Additionally, the claim that she does not believe in the First Amendment is also false. Hillary Clinton has publicly supported freedom of speech and the First Amendment. The claim that she believes in big government and that this flies in the face of the 10th Amendment is also misleading. Hillary Clinton has supported some government programs and regulations, but she has also advocated for states' rights and has not proposed a complete disregard for the 10th Amendment.

Answer: 0"
982,"Explanation: The claim that voter fraud provided a portion of the margin of victory of Democrat John Lehman over Republican Sen. Van Wanggaard in a state Senate recall election is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. The election results were certified by the appropriate authorities, and no significant allegations of voter fraud were made or substantiated.

Answer: 0"
983,"Explanation: The claim that Georgia's illegal immigration crackdown laws should be called the ""Brown Codes"" due to their similarity to the Black Codes is a misinterpretation of historical context and a misuse of terminology. The Black Codes were a set of laws passed in the Southern United States after the Civil War to control and subjugate the newly freed slaves. The term ""Brown Codes"" is not a recognized historical term and does not have a specific meaning in the context of immigration laws. The comparison between the two sets of laws is not accurate or appropriate.

Answer: 0"
984,"Explanation: The claim is based on a statement made by incoming House Speaker Dean Cannon and incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos regarding their plans for the next legislative session. This information is typically reported by reputable news sources, and there is no indication that the claim is false. The statement is a public announcement of their intentions, which is a common practice for incoming legislative leaders.

Answer: 1"
985,"Explanation: The claim that Donald Trump's comment about extremists being a ""JV team"" was not specifically referring to Islamic State is false.

986,"Explanation: Texas does not have a state-level equal pay law, but it is not accurate to say that it is one of only a handful of states without such a law. Many states do not have their own equal pay laws, and the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963 is the primary legislation addressing equal pay. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

Answer: 0"
987,"Explanation: The claim that ""by 2009, dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield by drones"" is true. The use of drones for targeted strikes against senior terrorist leaders, including Osama bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and other high-value targets, was a significant part of U.S. counter-terrorism strategy in the late 2000s. By 2009, several high-profile terrorist leaders had been eliminated through drone strikes.

Answer: 1"
988,"Explanation: The claim is false. Tommy Thompson, a former Secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush, has been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has publicly stated his opposition to it. He has also been critical of the mandate and has advocated for its repeal. There is no evidence to support the claim that he favors the mandate or was thanked by Obama for health reform support.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 0"
990,"Explanation: The claim that the Democratic Party created a debate schedule to maximize the opportunity for voters to see their candidates is true.

This is a common strategy used by political parties to increase visibility and engagement with the electorate.

Answer: 1"
991,"Explanation: The claim is false. The federal government's share of the gross domestic product (GDP) has been increasing over time, not decreasing. In 2020, the federal government's share of GDP was around 24.9%, which is higher than the 20% mentioned in the claim. The claim also incorrectly states that the private sector has lost 5% of its share, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
992,"Explanation: The claim that Governor Rick Scott is spending a quarter of a million of our tax dollars to robocall people is false. There is no evidence or credible source supporting this claim. Robocalls are typically used by political campaigns or other organizations to reach a large number of people quickly, but they are not funded by tax dollars. The claim seems to be a misinterpretation or a false statement.

Answer: 0"
993,"Explanation: The claim that South Florida has experienced nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s is not accurate. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the global sea level has risen by about 8 inches (20 cm) since the 1920s. While sea-level rise can vary regionally, the claim of nine inches specifically for South Florida is an exaggeration.

Answer: 0"

Answer: 1"
996,"Explanation: The claim suggests that the president of the United States visited a ward that had a high percentage of votes for him in the last election, but the vote count did not increase. This claim is not verifiable with the information provided and lacks specific details about the ward, the president's visit, and the vote count. Without concrete evidence or a source, it is impossible to confirm the truth of this claim.

Answer: 0"
997,"Explanation: The claim is false. In the United States, public employees have the right to choose whether or not to join a union, but this is not a new policy. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 already provides this right. The claim suggests that this is a new policy, which is not accurate.

Answer: 0"
998,"Explanation: The claim states that a proposal to boost the teacher pension fund puts no mandate on local government. This claim is false because the proposal to boost the teacher pension fund would likely involve some form of mandate or requirement for local governments to contribute to the fund. The specifics of the mandate would depend on the details of the proposal, but the general idea is that local governments would be required to contribute to the fund to ensure its sustainability and to meet the needs of retired teachers.

Answer: 0"
999,"Explanation: The claim is false. Hillary Clinton did not help a man accused of raping a 12-year-old, nor was she seen laughing at the girl who was raped.
