From the provided sources, we can gather the following information:","Explanation: The claim states that Texas has one state inspector for every 4,500 oil and gas wells. From the provided sources, we can gather the following information:
- As of July, Texas had over 161,000 oil wells and 86,000 gas wells, totaling approximately 247,000 wells.
- The Railroad Commission of Texas currently has 180 oil and gas inspectors statewide.

To verify the claim, we need to calculate the ratio of inspectors to wells:
- Total number of wells = 161,000 (oil) + 86,000 (gas) = 247,000 wells.

The ratio of inspectors to wells is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ inspectors}}{247,000 \text{ wells}} \approx 0.000726 \text{ inspectors per well} \]
